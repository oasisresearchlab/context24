Abstract Nonvesicular lipid transport among different membranes or membrane domains plays crucial roles in processes such as lipid homeostasis and organelle biogenesis . However , the forces that drive such lipid transport are not well understood . We propose that lipids tend to flow towards the membrane area with a higher membrane protein density in a process termed lipid osmosis . This process lowers the membrane tension in the area when the lipid flow reaches equilibrium . We examine the thermodynamic basis and experimental evidence of lipid osmosis and the corresponding osmotic membrane tension . We predict that lipid osmosis can drive lipid flows between different membrane regions through lipid transfer proteins , scramblases , or other similar barriers that selectively pass lipids but not membrane proteins . We also speculate on the biological functions of lipid osmosis . Finally , we explore other driving forces for lipid transfer and describe potential methods and systems to further test our theory . Lipid transfer through lipid transfer proteins and scramblases Lipid trafficking is essential for the formation and proper function of organelles in the cell . Lipids are primarily synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and transported to various organelle membranes . Damaged membranes or organelles are delivered to and degraded in lysosomes . Such lipid trafficking can be vesicle - dependent or - independent . While the former has been well understood , which also mediates the trafficking of proteins and other molecules , the latter has just been emerging as a key pathway specific for lipid transfer [ 1 - 3 ] . The nonvesicular lipid transport is mediated by a large , conserved family of lipid transfer proteins ( LTPs ) [ 4 ] . They transfer lipids at the membrane contact sites where two membranes are brought into 10 – 30 nm by LTPs and other membrane tethering proteins . LTPs are categorized into bridge and shuttle LTPs based on their structures , functions , and mechanisms of lipid transfer . Bridge LTPs contain taco - like grooves of 10 – 30 nm in length lined with hydrophobic residues [ 5 , 6 ] ( Figure 1a ) . With both ends attached to membranes , they act as a conduit to allow lipids of different species to flow quickly through the 2 groove . Bridge LTPs not only help regulate lipid compositions but also mediate organelle biogenesis and dynamics associated with large changes in membrane areas and morphologies [ 7 ] . Shuttle LTPs contain hydrophobic cavities that bind one or a few lipids at a time and transfer lipids between two membranes , often by sequentially exchanging lipids at both membranes , thereby regulating lipid compositions [ 8 , 9 ] ( Figure 1b ) . However , both kinds of LTPs transfer lipids in the cytosolic membrane leaflets . Lipid scramblases equilibrate lipids between two leaflets and may cooperate with bridge LTPs to transfer lipids [ 10 - 13 ] ( Figure 1a ) . The scramblases provide an intramembrane hydrophilic channel or thin the membrane for lipids to flip between two leaflets [ 14 - 16 ] . Whereas the effects of lipid transfer are widely observed , it remains unclear what drives the directional lipid flow and how such lipid flow alters the lipid compositions of membranes [ 1 , 3 ] . Some lipid transfer processes are coupled with ATPases that pump lipids against their concentration gradients , such as MsbA , lipopolysaccharide transport ( Lpt ) proteins , and lipid flippases [ 15 , 17 ] . However , LTP - mediated lipid transfer appears to be independent of ATP or other energy sources [ 18 , 19 ] . Instead , the directional lipid transfer likely results from the continuous or discontinuous flow of lipids along gradients of their chemical potentials across different membranes or membrane domains , which is our focus in this work . Therefore , in the following , we will not distinguish lipid transfer and lipid flow . Lipid flow between different membrane domains through fences Lipids also flow between different membrane domains , which may be driven by new forces in addition to the well - known membrane tension gradient . Cell membranes contain transient or permanent domains with distinct sizes and compositions of lipids and proteins , which are often separated by barriers formed by protein complexes [ 20 ] . These barriers block or hinder the diffusion of membrane proteins between the two membrane domains but generally allow faster passage of lipids [ 21 , 22 ] . For example , the plasma membrane of the neuron is highly compartmentalized by distinct diffusion barriers ( Figure 2a ) . These barriers are located at the initial segment between the cell body and the axon and at the neck of the dendritic spine [ 23 , 24 ] . In addition , the axon membrane is supported by actin rings evenly distributed along the entire length of the axon , which also hinders the diffusion of membrane proteins [ 24 , 25 ] . Similarly , septin rings help compartmentalize plasma membranes at the bases of cilia and the cleavage furrow during cell division [ 26 - 28 ] , while tight junctions maintain apical and basolateral membranes in epicedial cells [ 20 ] . Intracellular cytoskeleton or extracellular matrix attaches plasma membranes to form dynamic fence - like structures [ 29 , 30 ] . These fences permit lipids to flow in and out but confine the mobile proteins for a significant time before they escape the fences , creating highly heterogenous protein distributions in plasma membranes [ 31 ] . Other barriers separate vesicle precursors from the plasma membrane during endocytosis , lipid droplets from the ER membrane , the ER exit site from the ER membrane , and mitochondrial cristae from the inner boundary membrane ( Figure 2b - e ) [ 32 , 33 ] , and the nuclear envelope from ER [ 34 ] . Many peripheral proteins are recruited to these isolated membrane domains to facilitate organelle biogenesis [ 35 , 36 ] . These barriers show common features with LTPs in that they selectively pass lipids between two membranes or membrane domains with different densities of membrane proteins . Membrane tension gradient has long been recognized as a major driving force for lipid flow within the same membrane [ 21 , 22 , 30 , 37 ] and is expected to also serve as a driving force for the 3 lipid flow across different membranes through LTPs or leaflets through scramblases ( Figure 1 ) . However , the membrane tension of some plasma membranes varies significantly in different areas tested without significant lipid flow between them [ 21 , 22 , 38 , 39 ] . This observation suggests that other forces may counteract the membrane tension gradient for lipid flow . We hypothesize that the difference in membrane protein densities across the protein diffusion barriers or LTPs generates a new driving force for directional lipid flow termed lipid osmosis [ 40 ] . Lipid osmosis and osmotic membrane tension Osmosis plays a key role in the transport of water and other small molecules between different cell compartments , cells , tissues , and organs [ 41 ] . For example , our blood contains 60 – 80 mg / ml proteins , mainly human albumin proteins , that generate osmotic pressure to counteract hydrostatic blood pressure to draw extracellular fluid back into the blood and help to circulate ~ 8 liters of fluid every day . Lipid osmosis is an analogous osmotic process occurring in two - dimensional membranes through nanoscale lipid filters . To justify the process , we notice that the chemical potential of a lipid in a membrane subject to membrane tension  is B a k T     − − ( 1 ) where a is the average lateral area per lipid , B k is the Boltzmann constant , T is the absolute temperature with B k T = 4 . 1 pN×nm at room temperature , and 1  is the ratio of the number of mobile membrane proteins to that of lipids . For simplicity , here we have assumed that there is only a single species of lipids in the membrane whose number dominates that of proteins . The chemical potential with multiple species of lipids and all range of  is shown in Eq . S10 in Supplementary Text . Thus , membrane tension and the presence of membrane proteins lower the chemical potential of lipids by decreasing their mechanical energy and increasing their mixing entropy , respectively . To illustrate lipid osmosis , suppose an enclosed fence separates a planar membrane into two regions ( Figure 2f ) . We assume that the membrane inside the fence has a mobile protein density higher than that of the outside , with a difference c a    and an initial tension equal to that of the inside . At this moment , the lipids outside the fence have a higher chemical potential than that of the lipids inside . Consequently , lipids flow inside . As more lipids accumulate inside the fence , the inside membrane tension decreases , which gradually increases the lipid chemical potential and slows down the lipid flow . When the lipid transfer between the two membrane regions reaches equilibrium , the chemical potentials of lipids inside and outside the fence become equal , leading to lower membrane tension inside than outside , or the osmotic membrane tension . B k Tc  = ( 2 ) The density and composition of membrane proteins vary greatly among different biological membranes . For example , bacteria membranes and synaptic vesicles have a high protein density of ~ 0 . 1 nm - 2 , while the plasma membranes of HeLa cells and kidney fibroblast contain 0 . 03 – 0 . 05 nm - 2 integral proteins [ 29 ] . In contrast , autophagosomes bear few integral proteins [ 42 ] . Consequently , the osmotic membrane tension can be as high as 0 . 4 pN / nm , compared to the reported cell membrane tension of 0 – 0 . 4 pN / nm [ 21 , 30 , 37 , 43 ] . Therefore , a physiological protein density gradient can generate a high osmotic membrane tension . Correspondingly , each lipid in the membranes has a minimal chemical potential of - 0 . 07 k B T assuming a typical lateral area of 0 . 7 nm 2 for lipids . This magnitude of energy is equivalent to the potential energy of a water molecule 4 at a water height of ~ 1 , 000 meters ! Thus , lipid osmosis can modulate membrane tension and lipid flow , in additional to other well - known mechanical and chemical means , including forces produced by cytoskeleton and molecular motors , osmotic pressure , lipid synthesis or degradation , and membrane remodeling by proteins . Lipid osmosis and osmotic membrane tension may occur between different membranes mediated by bridge LTPs ( Figure 1a ) , because the above thermodynamic analysis does not depend on the shape , size , and other details of lipid filters and membrane proteins . In general , the rate of the lipid flow J from a donor membrane to an acceptor membrane through a fence or a bridge LTP is proportional to the sum of the difference in the canonical membrane tension and the osmotic membrane tension , i . e . , ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) , A D A D B J G G k T c c      =  +  = − + −   ( 3 ) where the superscript indicates membranes ( A = acceptor ; D = donor ) and G is the lipid permeability of the fence or bridge LTP [ 40 ] . This equation is a direct extension of the Starling equation governing the extracellular fluid flow between blood and tissues , where canonic and osmotic membrane tension replaces hydrostatic and colloid osmotic pressure between plasma inside microvessels and their outside interstitial fluid , respectively [ 44 ] . Equation ( 3 ) indicates that the gradients of membrane tension and the protein density may drive lipid flow synergistically or antagonistically , depending upon the signs of ( ) ( ) A D   − and ( ) ( ) A D c c − . When the two terms have opposite signs , little lipid flow or even reverse lipid flow may occur despite the presence of a significant membrane tension gradient . The latter scenario is analogous to reverse osmosis utilized in sea water desalting [ 41 ] and thus may be called reverse lipid osmosis . Membrane curvature , potential , and other factors in lipid flow The chemical potential of lipids in a membrane also depends on the membrane curvature , the electric potential for charged lipids , the volume for an enclosed membrane , and lipid - lipid and lipid - protein interactions , thereby affecting lipid transfer . The bending energy of a membrane can be calculated by the Helfrich equation or other theories of membrane elasticity , which also depends on the global shape , spontaneous curvature , membrane tension , as well as the interior pressure of an enclosed membrane [ 45 - 47 ] . Here , we calculated the chemical potential of a lipid in a spherical vesicle as 2 1 1 , bending s s a R R R     = −     ( 4 ) where R is the radius of the vesicle , s R is the radius of spontaneous curvature of the membrane , and  is the membrane bending rigidity with a typical value of ~ 100 pN×nm ( see Section 3 in Supplementary Text for the derivation of the equation ) . For small vesicles with a high spontaneous curvature , the chemical potential of its lipids can be high . For example , with s R = 50 nm , a = 0 . 7 nm 2 , the chemical potential is 3 9 10 − −  k B T for R = 30 nm and 3 7 10 −  k B T for R = 100 nm . However , for vesicles whose membranes bear no spontaneous curvature ( s R → +  ) , the chemical potential of their lipids is zero regardless of the vesicle size . 5 The chemical potential of charged lipids strongly depends on the electric potential of the membrane or leaflet where the lipids are located , with e l ec t r i c q V  = where q is the charge per lipid and V is the electric potential of the membrane . LTP - mediated lipid transfer has been observed between ER and all other organelles with different lumen potential ( Figure 1a ) . While ER lumen is approximately neutral relative to the cytosol , the lumen of mitochondria or lysosome has an electric potential of 200 100 − −− mV or + 30 ̶ + 120 mV , respectively [ 48 ] . Even a small gradient of electric potential between different organelle membranes could provide a huge driving force for lipid transfer with the help of lipid scramblases . For example , the chemical potential of a single lipid with a unit charge in two membrane leaflets with a potential difference of 100 mV differs by 3 . 9 k B T , which is orders of magnitude greater than the chemical potential induced by physiological membrane tension and membrane curvature described above ( 4 2 10 10 − − − k B T ) . However , lipid transfer may be coupled to ion transduction across membranes , which may lower the overall chemical potential change . Alternatively , lipid transfer may only occur when the membranes are transiently depolarized with minimal membrane potential . Supporting these views , many scramblases , including TMEM16F , are also ion channels and transfer both ions and lipids upon activation [ 15 , 49 , 50 ] . More work is required to distinguish the different scenarios of lipid transfer between polarized membranes . The chemical potential of a lipid strongly depends on its membrane environment due to lipid - lipid and lipid - protein interactions . For example , cholesterol tends to flow to membranes containing lipids with long saturated acyl chains [ 51 ] . Finally , the lipid transfer associated with the membrane expansion of an organelle is often accompanied by its volume change , which may change the chemical potential of lipids in the membrane , thereby facilitating or opposing lipid transfer depending on the pressure difference on the two sides of the membrane . In conclusion , the chemical potential of a lipid critically depends on its environment , including membrane tension , protein density , electric potential , volume of an enclosed membrane , and lipid - lipid and lipid - protein interactions . These factors together determine the direction and amount of lipid flow . In the following , we use the lipid chemical potential to quantify the lipid transfer mediated by LTPs in the default presence of scramblases . Bridge LTPs Suppose a bridge LTP transfers lipids between a donor membrane and an acceptor membrane , then upon equilibrium , the fractions of any species of lipids ( ) D i x and ( ) A i x in the donor and acceptor membranes , respectively , satisfy the following Boltzmann distribution derived from equal chemical potentials of lipids in the two membranes ( see Section 2 . 1 of Supplementary Text for its derivation ) ( ) ( ) , 1 , , . i B e k T D A i i x x e i n  = = ( 5 ) Here , the subscript i designates the i - th lipid species in a total of n different lipid species present in both membranes , and , i i i e a q V   =  −  ( 6 ) 6 where ( ) ( ) D A     = − and ( ) ( ) D A V V V  = − are the differences in membrane tension and potential , respectively , and i a and i q are the lateral area and charge of the lipid , respectively . Therefore , the relative lipid distributions strongly depend on the membrane tension difference , as well as the potential difference for charged lipids . Consequently , lipids flow to the membrane with a high membrane tension and a low membrane potential for charged lipids ( Figure 3 ) . The absolute distribution of each species of lipids in each membrane can be derived from Eq . ( 5 ) , as is shown Eqs . S24 - S26 in Supplementary Text . These derivations highlight the role of lipid osmosis in membrane expansion , which can be better seen in the absence of any membrane tension and potential gradients , or 0 , 1 , , . i e i n  = = In this case , lipids are drawn to the membrane with a high protein density ( Eq . S27 ) . Upon equilibrium , the fractions of proteins in different membranes become identical , and so do the fractions of each lipid species ( Figure 3b and Eq . S28 ) . Therefore , the equilibrium size of the membrane is approximately proportional to the number of membrane proteins in the membrane , and all lipids are fully mixed . However , the equilibrium size of the membrane is altered by the membrane tension gradient , but all lipids remain fully mixed ( Figure 3c and Eq . S31 ) . The rate of bulk lipid flow through a bridge LTP appears to be high in vivo ( > 100 s - 1 ) [ 52 ] but has not been accurately measured [ 40 ] . To estimate the flow rate , we approximate the LTP as a lipid bridge with a width d and a length l between two membranes with a membrane tension difference   and potential difference V  ( Figure 1a ) . Treating the lipids as a two - dimensional viscous fluid , we solved the Navier - Stokes equation governing the fluid dynamics , yielding the unidirectional bulk lipid flow rate through a single bridge LTP as 3 , 12 d q V J al h a      =  +     ( 7 ) where  and h are the viscosity and thickness , respectively , of the lipid bilayer , and q is the average charge per lipid ( see Section 5 of Supplementary Text for its derivation ) . This is essentially the two - dimensional version of the Hagen - Poiseuille equation [ 53 ] . The rate strongly depends on the groove width of bridge LTPs , which varies from 1 nm to 4 nm along their lengths based on the AlphaFold structures of a few bridge LTPs without lipids in their grooves [ 54 ] . Assuming h   5 . 8×10 - 7 pN× s / nm , 0 . 7 a = nm 2 , d = 1 nm , l = 20 nm , V  = 0 , and   = 0 . 001 – 0 . 1 pN / nm , we estimate the lipid flux J = 10 – 1026 s - 1 . This value is close to our previous estimation using a different approach [ 40 ] . Similarly , in the presence of 50 mV potential gradient and an average of 0 . 1 unit charge per lipid , but no membrane tension gradient , the lipid flux is 1 . 2×10 4 s - 1 . In the presence of lipid osmosis or a protein density difference between the two membranes , the membrane tension difference   in Eq . ( 7 ) should be replaced by  +  , as is indicated by Eq . ( 3 ) . Thus , physiological membrane tension or potential gradient can drive rapid bulk lipid flow consistent with in vivo observations . The unidirectional bulk lipid flow differs from lipid diffusion through bridge LTPs , which are bidirectional without bulk lipid flow . In a typical experiment to test lipid transfer , a lipid transfer rate is often derived from the measured rate of fluorescent tracer lipids diffusing from one membrane to the other through LTPs . Given the same model for the bridge LTP ( Figure 1a ) , the rate can be derived as 7 , d D d J l a = ( 8 ) where D is the lateral diffusion constant of the lipid ( see Section 6 of Supplementary Text ) . Choosing D = 5 µm 2 / s and other parameters as above , we estimated the lipid transfer rate as d J = 3 . 6×10 5 s - 1 . Thus , lipids can rapidly diffuse through a bridge LTP without bulk lipid flow . Shuttle LTPs Suppose a shuttle LTP transfers two species of lipids designated as 1 and 2 in the subscript between a donor membrane and an acceptor membrane through a lipid exchange mechanism ( Figure 1c ) . While bridge LTPs transport many if not all species of lipids , shuttle LTPs only transfer their cognate lipids [ 4 , 9 , 51 ] . When the lipid transfer reaches equilibrium , the lipid fractions of the two lipid species in the two membranes satisfy the following equation ( see Section 2 . 2 of Supplementary Text for its derivation ) ( ) ( ) 1 1 ( ) ( ) 2 2 , B e D A k T D A x x e x x  = ( 9 ) where ( ) ( ) 1 2 1 2 . e a a q q V   = −  − −  ( 10 ) The absolute distributions of lipids in both membranes can also be derived based on Eq . ( 9 ) . Both equations suggest that the equilibrium lipid distributions are sensitive to the membrane tension gradient only when the two lipid species differ in their lateral areas ( or 1 2 a a  ) . For example , Osh4p exchanges cholesterol and PI4P with a significant difference in their lateral areas ( 0 . 45 nm 2 for cholesterol and ~ 0 . 7 nm 2 for PI4P ) [ 8 , 51 ] . Therefore , Osh4p - mediated lipid transfer is predicted to be sensitive to membrane tension and more PI4P is drawn to membranes with higher membrane tension . However , shuttle LTPs are generally less sensitive to membrane tension gradient in lipid transfer than bridge LTPs are . In contrast , membrane potential gradient is expected to greatly affect lipid transfer by shuttle LTPs , such as Osh4p , because their cognate lipids often differ in charge . Moreover , shuttle LTPs do not cause bulk lipid transfer between membranes because the lipid exchange scheme only alters the lipid composition but not the total number of lipids in each membrane ( Figure 3d ) . Consequently , the equilibrium lipid distributions are independent of protein distributions in both membranes . In other words , lipid osmosis does not play a role in the equilibrium lipid distributions . The rate of lipid transfer mediated by shuttle LTPs has been solved analytically or numerically [ 40 ] . The rate depends on two lipid exchange rate constants associated with each membrane ( Figure 1c ) . The rate constants for different membranes are generally different , corresponding to 0 e   . If the two rate constants are the same for both donor and acceptor membranes , or ( ) ( ) 1 1 1 D A k k k = = and ( ) ( ) 2 2 2 D A k k k = = , corresponding to the case of e  = 0 , and the LTP is free in solution without a membrane tether , the rate to transfer both species of lipids can be expressed as 8 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) 1 2 1 2 ( ) ( ) 1 1 2 2 , LT P D A D A D A D A N k k N N k k N k N + = + ( 11 ) where ( ) LT P N is the total number of shuttle LTPs and 1 k and 2 k are the exchange rate constants leading to extraction of lipid species 1 and 2 , respectively , by the LTP . This formula has been used to fit the measured rates of the lipid transfer mediated by Osh4p [ 40 ] . Lipid osmosis between two leaflets Lipid osmosis is also expected to occur between two leaflets of a membrane through scramblases . Lipid scramblases contain a hydrophilic groove or thin the surrounding membrane to facilitate lipids to flip between the two leaflets [ 14 , 49 , 50 ] . The two leaflets often bear different densities of peripheral membrane proteins , causing lipid osmosis to draw more lipids to the leaflet with higher density of proteins . The accumulation of lipids generates membrane curvature in a manner dependent on the protein density gradient . To appreciate the role of lipid osmosis in membrane bending , we modified the area - difference - elastic model of membranes [ 47 ] to include the effect of lipid osmosis and derive the curvature induced by lipid osmosis ( see Section 4 of Supplementary Text ) as 1 ' . ' B e k T c C R K h    = = + ( 12 ) Here , R is the radius of curvature of the membrane ,  and '  are the local and non - local membrane bending rigidities , respectively , K is stretching modulus of the bilayer , and c is the difference in the densities of peripheral proteins in the two leaflets . This equation indicates that the equilibrium membrane curvature due to lipid osmosis is proportional to the difference in the protein densities in both leaflets . The stretch modulus is 100 ‒ 500 pN / nm for purified membranes and as small as 0 . 04 pN / nm for biological membranes , while for typical membranes , '    , h = 2 . 5 nm [ 22 , 29 , 47 , 55 ] . With these membrane parameters , we estimated a protein density gradient of  = 0 . 1 nm - 2 bends the membrane with a radius of curvature of 4 ‒ 2000 nm with a stretch modulus ranging from 0 . 5 pN / nm to 250 pN / nm . Thus , lipid osmosis across two leaflets of membranes can generate significant membrane curvature by driving scramblase - mediated lipid flow . Potential roles of lipid osmosis in membrane dynamics Lipid osmosis tends to draw lipids to membrane domains with higher protein densities , thereby expanding the membranes . Therefore , lipid osmosis likely plays an important role in the biogenesis and maintenance of many organelles associated with membrane expansion or replenishment . LTPs are involved in the membrane expansion of phagophores , lipid droplets , prospores during yeast sporulation , acrosome in sperms , and Gran - negative bacteria [ 7 , 56 ] . Various proteins coat the necks between different membrane domains ( Figure 2 ) . These LTPs and protein coats prevent membrane proteins from diffusion away from new organelles , which may facilitate membrane expansion or lipid homeostasis . Growing organelles , such as phagophores and lipid droplets , are often crowded with membrane proteins on their surfaces , especially peripheral proteins recruited from the cytosol [ 35 , 36 ] . For example , an average of 272 Atg8 proteins are covalently attached to PE lipids on a phagophore , which is crucial for its growth [ 57 ] . On a phagophore with a radius of 9 30 nm , the Atg8 protein alone contributes a protein density of 0 . 024 nm - 2 , corresponding to a high osmotic membrane tension of 0 . 1 pN / nm . Note that many of these proteins play additional roles in organelle biogenesis , such as membrane remodeling and recruitment of other proteins . Finally , overexpression of many membrane proteins generates inducible intracellular membranes , which appear to be artificial membranes with sizes ranging from tens of nanometers to several micrometers and different shapes [ 58 , 59 ] . They can bud from different organelles where the membrane proteins are over - expressed and are observed in bacteria , yeast , and mammalian cells . Often , the transmembrane domains of these proteins alone are sufficient for forming new membrane buds , regardless of their cytosolic domains or enzymatic activities . All these observations are consistent with the potential role of lipid osmosis in membrane expansion . Lipid osmosis can be strong enough to overcome other forces opposing organelle growth , such as membrane bending . Based on Eq . ( 1 ) , the total lipid - protein mixing energy of a membrane can be estimated as p B N k T − . Therefore , the presence of each mobile membrane protein contributes to an energy of B k T favoring membrane growth . Assuming a spheric shape for a growing organelle , its total bending energy is 8  or ~ 500 B k T regardless of its radius . Therefore , ~ 500 membrane proteins are sufficient to overcome the bending energy to stabilize the growing organelle . Assuming a maximum protein density of 0 . 2 nm - 2 due to size exclusion , we estimated a minimum radius of 14 nm for the organelle . The estimation suggests that lipid osmosis alone is strong enough to counteract membrane bending to support a growing vesicle with a radius greater than 14 nm . The initial growth below such a small radius probably needs membrane bending activities of proteins and / or mechanical forces provided by cytoskeleton or molecular motors . Finally , a lower equilibrium membrane tension in the membrane domains with a higher membrane protein density facilitates the birth of new organelles . Due to their small sizes , these nascent organelles generally have a smaller radius of membrane curvature ( R ) than their connected membranes , while both membranes experience the same interior pressure due to their connected lumens ( Figure 2 ) . For the two membranes to co - exist with the same pressure ( p  ) , the more curved membrane should have lower membrane tension (  ) , as suggested by the Young - Laplace equation ( 2 p R  =   ) [ 60 ] . A more accurate and quantitative assessment of lipid osmosis shall consider the shape , membrane tension , pressure , and other factors of the organelle [ 45 , 46 , 61 ] . Methods to test lipid osmosis and lipid transfer Despite the potential of bridge LTPs to mediate fast bulk lipid flow observed in the cell [ 62 ] , a few bridge LTPs tested so far can only slowly transfer lipids between vesicles in vitro with a few lipids per minute per LTP [ 2 , 63 , 64 ] . The lipid transfer probably occurs via a shuttle mechanism in the absence of net driving forces for lipid flow . Therefore , it is imperative to reconstitute the fast bulk lipid flow through bridge LTPs and test the various driving forces , especially lipid osmosis , described in the preceding sections . However , these driving forces often counteract each other to oppose fast lipid flow . For example , bulk lipid flow would cause a change in the membrane area of a vesicle , which in turn causes changes in membrane tension and curvature if the membrane tension is not controlled or the volume of the vesicle is kept constant . As a result , bulk lipid flow is unlikely to occur between small unilamellar liposomes ( SUVs ) , as previously observed [ 63 ] . 10 Therefore , it is crucial to study lipid flow in a system where each of the parameters affecting lipid flow can be independently controlled . In contrast to cell membranes , model membranes allow fine - tuning of the lipid composition , curvature , tension , and separation of membranes . Additionally , the model membranes generally allow the incorporation of proteins that regulate membrane flow , including those acting as fences , bridges , and shuttles . For proteins that are difficult to purify or reconstitute , their functions may be surrogated by rationally designed nanostructures . In this section , we review a few tools that may be used to characterize the energetics and kinetics of lipid flow in a cell - free environment , with an emphasis on the utilities of cutting - edge membrane engineering methods enabled by DNA nanotechnology [ 65 ] . Several commonly used model membranes are suitable for experimentally studying lipid flow , including unilamellar liposomes ( SUVs and GUVs ) , supported bilayers , and free - standing bilayers [ 66 - 69 ] . For example , to examine lipid transfer across two apposed membranes , one can potentially bring two liposomes ( or a liposome and a supported bilayer ) containing reconstituted LTPs into proximity . Fluorescent tracers embedded in membranes can be used to track lipid flow , and the bulk lipid flow resulting in the growth of GUVs may be directly observed under microscopy . Tension of the two membranes can be tuned by osmolarity pressure and / or micropipette aspiration ( Figure 4a ) while being monitored by tension - sensitive fluorophores such as FliptR [ 70 ] or membrane tethers pulling [ 71 ] . Chemically modified lipids can be incorporated into the membranes for subsequent recruitment of proteins to change the protein density . Membrane curvatures can be controlled by using liposomes of well - defined radii ( from tens to several hundred nanometers ; see our theoretical discussion above ) . Conventional methods ( e . g . , extrusion ) often lead to heterogeneous liposome sizes that are difficult to control deterministically . In contrast , DNA cages carrying amphipathic moieties have served as molds for membrane reconstitution to generate sub - 100 nm liposomes with predefined , uniform sizes ( Figure 4b , left ) [ 72 ] . Attaching DNA bricks to heterogeneous liposomes has enabled the centrifugation - based size sorting ( 30 – 150 nm ) that led to liposome populations with very narrow size distributions [ 73 ] . The inter - membrane distance can be controlled with nanometer precision by rigid DNA segments anchored on both membranes [ 74 - 76 ] ( Figure 4b , right ) , mimicking membrane contact sites in cells . For example , liposome pairs held at controlled distances have helped shed light on the mechanism of lipid - transferring protein E - Syt1 , suggesting its shuttle - like transport activities are dependent on its membrane tether length relative to the inter - membrane distance [ 75 ] . To study the lateral lipid flow within the same membrane , it is conceivable to use a GUV with its membrane laced with cytoskeleton and membrane protein fences . Although it is possible to reconstitute dynamic actin networks on model membranes [ 77 , 78 ] , the membrane domains defined by the actin fences are usually irregular and hard to finetune , making it difficult to manipulate and measure the properties of each domain . Therefore , one may consider using membrane - anchored DNA filaments as an artificial cytoskeleton [ 79 ] . Indeed , various curved or straight DNA filaments have been assembled on or inside GUVs [ 80 - 84 ] . By programming the assembling pattern of the DNA filaments and their membrane anchors , one could build a series of picket - and - fence like architectures that limit in - plane protein ( but not lipid ) diffusion , making it possible to generate a protein - density gradient and test lipid osmosis . The state - of - the - art membrane manipulation methods offer a promising solution to reconstituting lipid flow in a cell - free environment . However , several technical challenges remain . 11 For example , independently tuning the tension of two or multiple membranes in a system is likely necessary to generate lipid flow , yet difficult to achieve . More versatile and user - friendly tension - sensing probes are also needed to monitor the mechanical stress of membranes in real - time . These challenges call for novel molecular tools that directly address the mechanical properties of membranes and manage leaflet homeostasis . We propose that because DNA nanostructures can undergo conformational changes to exert force to drive membrane deformation on demand [ 85 ] , it should be possible to build DNA - based devices that modulate membrane tension in a stepwise and targeted manner . Similarly , mechanosensitive DNA structures embedded in membranes , such as a transmembrane channel with dilatable diameter , can serve as membrane tension sensors [ 86 ] . Coincidentally , DNA nanopores can facilitate molecular exchange across membranes and scramble lipids between leaflets [ 87 ] . Conflict of interest The authors declare no conflict of interest .

Lipid transfer proteins ( LTPs ) and scramblases transfer lipids between different membrane leaflets . ( a ) A bridge LTP , shown here by the AlphFold structure of a representative bridge LTP VPS13A , acts as a lipid conduit to allow bulk lipid flow from one membrane to the other . The flow may be driven by the gradient of membrane tension , electric potential , or membrane protein density as indicated . The channel on the right represents an idealized bridge LTP used to estimate its lipid flow rate . ( b ) A representative shuttle LTP ORP5 transfers PS and PI4P between the plasma membrane ( PM ) and the ER through two lipid - exchange processes . ORP5 contains an N - terminal pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain that binds to the PM , a middle OSBP - related domain ( ORP ) that binds to PS or PI4P , and a C - terminal transmembrane domain in the ER . Three snapshots of the lipid transfer are shown . ( c ) The two lipid - exchange processes are characterized by two sets of rate constants , which may be equal or different , depending upon the membrane environments . DMi , AMi , and Ti with i = 1 or 2 denote the i - th lipid species in the donor membrane , acceptor membrane , and shuttle LTP , respectively . ( d ) Lipid osmosis can occur between different leaflets of the same membrane mediated by scramblases , which may cause membrane bending . Figure 2 . Ubiquitous barriers separate cell membranes into domains with distinct functions and membrane protein densities and compositions . ( a ) The axon and dendritic spines are separated from the neural cell body at the initial segment and dendritic spine neck , respectively , 12 by physical barriers that limit protein diffusion across the membrane domains . ( b ) The vesicular precursor crowded with membrane proteins ( red circles ) is connected to the plasma membrane through a protein - coated neck . Lipid osmosis ( blue arrow ) may facilitate the vesicular membrane expansion . ( c ) Seipin forms a decameric fence - like structure in the ER membrane to mediate lipid droplet ( LD ) formation between the two ER leaflets . ( d ) The ER exit site is a specialized ER domain that serves as a hub for membrane trafficking . The domain is connected to the ER membrane by a neck coated by proteins including COPII and TANGO1 . ( e ) The mitochondrial inner membrane invaginates to form cristae with protein - coated crista junctions ( marked by blue circles ) connected to the inner boundary membrane . ( f ) Lipid osmosis occurs through a protein fence that selectively passes lipids but not membrane proteins ( blue dashed ring ) , leading to lower equilibrium tension of the membrane inside the fence with enriched proteins . Figure 3 . Areas and lipid distributions of two membranes before and after the LTP - mediated lipid transfer reaches equilibrium . ( a ) The two membranes initially have identical areas but contain different lipid species ( indicated by different grey scales ) and densities of membrane proteins ( red circles and cyan rectangles ) before lipid transfer . ( b ) In the absence of membrane tension gradient , lipid osmosis through bridge LTPs causes expansion of the membrane with a higher density of membrane proteins , leading to equal densities of membrane proteins and fractions of lipids in both membranes upon equilibrium . ( c ) A high gradient of membrane tension counteracts lipid osmosis to expand the membrane with lower membrane protein density , leading to reverse lipid osmosis . ( d ) Lipid transfer mediated by shuttle LTPs causes lipid mixing without changes in membrane areas in a manner independent of the protein density gradient . Figure 4 . Methods for controlling tension , curvature , and separation of model membranes . ( a ) Membrane tension of a GUV can be controlled by micropipette aspiration and measured by membrane tether pulling with optical tweezers . Different suction pressures can be applied via the micropipette to change membrane tension . The pulling force measured by the optical trap can be used to calculate the membrane tension . ( b ) Membrane curvature and inter - membrane distance of SUVs ( grey ) can be controlled by DNA - origami frames ( blue ) . These DNA nanostructures can be modified with amphipathic molecules on the interior ( not shown for clarity ) and serve as templates for vesicle reconstitution . Left : a size - defined SUV formed inside a DNA ring . Right : a pair of SUVs separated by a set of rigid DNA pillars with defined lengths . 13 References 1 .
