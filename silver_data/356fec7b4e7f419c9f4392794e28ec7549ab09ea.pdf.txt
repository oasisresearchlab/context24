We demonstrate here the generation of primordial germ cell - like cells ( PGCLCs ) in mice with robust capacity for spermato - genesis . PGCLCs were generated from embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) and induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) through epiblast - like cells ( EpiLCs ) , a cellular state highly similar to pregastrulating epiblasts but distinct from epiblast stem cells ( EpiSCs ) . Reﬂecting epiblast development , EpiLC induction from ESCs / iPSCs is a progressive process , and EpiLCs highly competent for the PGC fate are a transient entity . The global transcription proﬁles , epigenetic reprog - ramming , and cellular dynamics during PGCLC induction from EpiLCs meticulously capture those associated with PGC speciﬁcation from the epi - blasts . Furthermore , we identify Integrin - b 3 and SSEA1 as markers that allow the isolation of PGCLCs with spermatogenic capacity from tumorigenic un - differentiated cells . Our ﬁndings provide a paradigm for the ﬁrst step of in vitro gametogenesis . INTRODUCTION The germ cell lineage ensures the creation of new individuals in most multicellular organisms , perpetuating the genetic and epigenetic information across the generations . Accordingly , in vitro reconstitution of germ cell development is one of the most fundamental challenges in biology . In mice , germ cell fate is induced in the epiblasts at around embryonic day ( E ) 6 . 0 by the bone morphogenetic protein 4 ( Bmp4 ) signaling from the extraembryonic ectoderm ( Lawson et al . , 1999 ) . The primordial germ cells ( PGCs ) , the origins for both the oocytes and the sper - matozoa , are established at around E7 . 25 as a small cluster of alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) - positive cells in the extraembryonic mesoderm ( Ginsburg et al . , 1990 ; Saitou et al . , 2002 ) . Blimp1 ( Prdm1 ) and Prdm14 are critical transcriptional regulators for the PGC fate ( Kurimoto et al . , 2008 ; Ohinata et al . , 2005 ; Vincent et al . , 2005 ; Yamaji et al . , 2008 ) . Essentially all of the epiblast cells from E5 . 5 ! E6 . 0 are competent to express Blimp1 and Prdm14 in response to Bmp4 , and the PGC - like cells induced from the epiblasts ex vivo can form functional sperm when trans - planted into neonatal testes lacking endogenous germ cells ( Ohi - nata et al . , 2009 ) . A robust induction of germ cell fate in vitro might therefore be possible if one could generate the pregastru - lating ( E5 . 5 ! 6 . 0 ) epiblast - like cells in vitro . Two groups of pluripotent cells in mice , the inner cell mass ( ICM ) of preimplantation blastocysts at E3 . 5 – E4 . 5 and the epiblast of postimplantation embryos at E5 . 5 – E6 . 5 , give rise to two distinct pluripotent stem cell ( PSC ) types in vitro , which are called embryonic stem cells ( ESCs ) and epiblast stem cells ( EpiSCs ) , respectively ( Brons et al . , 2007 ; Evans and Kaufman , 1981 ; Tesar et al . , 2007 ) . ESCs bear the ground state ( naive ) plu - ripotency and can contribute to all lineages when introduced into blastocysts , whereas EpiSCs exhibit a primed pluripotency and are unable to contribute to chimeras when injected into blasto - cysts ( Nichols and Smith , 2009 ) . These two cell types show distinct morphologies , cytokine dependence , gene expression , and epigenetic proﬁles . Notably , human ( h ) ESCs are more like mouse ( m ) EpiSCs , reﬂecting the difﬁculty of capturing the naive pluripotency in nonrodent species ( Nichols and Smith , 2009 ) . There have been attempts to generate gametes or PGCs in vitro from ESCs both in mice and humans ( for review , see Da - ley , 2007 ; Saitou and Yamaji , 2010 ) . These attempts were based on a strategy of isolating cells that express a germ cell marker ( s ) in embryoid bodies differentiated spontaneously under unde - ﬁned conditions . Consequently , these efforts were inefﬁcient at obtaining the cells of interest ( less than ! 1 . 0 % ) and were unsuit - able for analyzing the events that take place before the emer - gence of germ cell - like cells . Critically , the induced cells have never been demonstrated to contribute to healthy offspring . There was a single report claiming the generation of live yet abnormal offspring from gamete - like cells derived from ESCs ( Nayernia et al . , 2006 ) , but whether these offspring carry a full haploid contribution from ESC - derived cells remains to be deter - mined ( Daley , 2007 ) . On the other hand , EpiSCs retain attributes of the original epiblasts and are a potential source for the generation of germ cell - like cells in vitro ( Hayashi and Surani , 2009 ; Tesar et al . , Cell 146 , 1 – 14 , August 19 , 2011 ª 2011 Elsevier Inc . 1 Please cite this article in press as : Hayashi et al . , Reconstitution of the Mouse Germ Cell Speciﬁcation Pathway in Culture by Pluripotent Stem Cells , Cell ( 2011 ) , doi : 10 . 1016 / j . cell . 2011 . 06 . 052 2007 ) . A subpopulation of the EpiSCs express Blimp1 under a self - renewing condition , and a minority of them are positive for stella ( Pgc7 / Dppa3 ) , a marker for the established PGCs . How - ever , the emergence of these cells from the EpiSCs occurs at a low frequency even in the presence of BMP4 ( ! 1 . 5 % ) , and the functionofthesecellsinvivohasnotbeendemonstrated ( Hayashi and Surani , 2009 ) . The relatively inefﬁcient induction of the PGC fate from EpiSCs may reﬂect the fact that the EpiSCs acquire propertiesthatareincompatibleforefﬁcientPGCinductionduring their culture . Note that the competence of the epiblast to form PGCs diminishes markedly after ! E6 . 25 ( Ohinata et al . , 2009 ) . Given these ﬁndings , we explored a condition under which ESCs and induced PSCs ( iPSCs ) ( Takahashi and Yamanaka , 2006 ) with naive pluripotency are induced into pregastrulating epiblast - like cells from which , in turn , PGC - like cells are induced . We demonstrate here the establishment of a deﬁned culture system reconstituting the PGC speciﬁcation pathway in mice . RESULTS Pregastrulating Epiblast - like Cells from ESCs We initially explored a variety of conditions to induce the PGC fate from the EpiSC aggregates or from EpiSCs cultured in two dimensions , but we did not ﬁnd conditions that improved on those described previously ( Figure S1 available online and data not shown ) ( Hayashi and Surani , 2009 ) . We therefore decided to explore a distinct strategy for the induction of the PGC fate from PSCs , based on the following considerations : ( 1 ) ESCs cultured under a serum - and feeder - free condition with a MAPK inhibitor ( PD0325901 ) , a GSK3 inhibitor ( CHIR99021 ) , and leukemia inhibitory factor ( LIF ) ( 2i + LIF ) exhibit a uniform property similar to the ICM / preimplantation epiblast ( ! E4 . 5 ) state ( the ground state ) ( Nichols et al . , 2009 ; Ying et al . , 2008 ) ; ( 2 ) ESCs form PGCs within a few days when introduced into the blastocysts ; and ( 3 ) in the continuous presence of Activin A ( ActA ) and basic ﬁbroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) , ESCs convert into EpiSC - like cells exhibiting similarities to the postimplanta - tion ( ! E6 . 5 ) epiblasts ( Guo et al . , 2009 ; Han et al . , 2010 ) . We reasoned that the ground state ESCs might rapidly differentiate into pregastrulating epiblast - like cells with high competence for the PGC fate under conditions similar to those used to induce EpiSC - like cells . We derived ESCs from the E3 . 5 blastocysts bearing Blimp1 - mVenus and stella - ECFP ( BVSC ) transgenes ( Ohinata et al . , 2008 ) under the ground state condition . Among a variety of conditions examined , stimulation with ActA , bFGF , and knock - out serum replacement ( KSR ) at a concentration as low as 1 % resulted in the uniform induction of ESCs into ﬂattened epithelial structures resembling the epiblasts over the 3 day period ( Fig - ures 1A and 1B ) . Stimulation with higher concentrations of KSR ( 2 % – 20 % ) resulted in the maintenance of a dome - shaped ESC morphology : the higher the KSR concentration , the greater the maintenance of the ESC - like state . In contrast , stimulation with ActA and bFGF without KSR resulted in an increased rate of cell death ( data not shown ) . Upon stimulation with ActA , bFGF , and 1 % KSR , the cells grew rapidly for the ﬁrst 2 days but thereafter underwent a signif - icant extent of cell death , and the number of the surviving cells at day 3 was similar to that at day 2 ( Figure 1D ) . As in ESCs , we observed no BVSC expression in the induced epiblast - like cells ( hereafter called EpiLCs ) during the 3 day differentiation period ( Figure 1B ) . An independent ESC line bearing Prdm14 - mVenus ( P14V ) transgenes ( Yamaji et al . , 2008 ) exhibited a similar differ - entiation upon the same stimulation : P14V was expressed in the ESCs but declined along with the EpiLC induction ( Figure 1B ) . Immunoﬂuorescence ( IF ) analysis showed that , during the EpiLC induction , Oct3 / 4 ( Pou5f1 ) was continuously expressed , but Sox2 and Nanog were decreased by day 2 and day 1 , respec - tively ( Figure 1C ) . The downregulation of Nanog during EpiLC differentiation was in sharp contrast to its continued expression in EpiSCs ( Figure S1C ) ( Hayashi and Surani , 2009 ) . We quantiﬁed the expression of key genes in the EpiLCs , EpiSCs , and E5 . 75 epiblasts by quantitative ( Q ) - PCR ( Figure 1E ) . During EpiLC differentiation , Oct3 / 4 was expressed at aconstant level , whereas genes more tightly associated with the ICM state , such as Sox2 , Nanog , and Prdm14 , as well as Zfp42 ( Rex1 ) , Tbx3 , Tcl1 , Esrrb , Klf2 , Klf4 , and Klf5 , were downregulated to levels similar to those in the epiblasts . In EpiSCs , Sox2 , Nanog , and Klf5 were retained at levels similar to those in ESCs . In both EpiLCs and EpiSCs , Wnt3 , Fgf5 , and Dnmt3b , which are upregulated in the epiblasts , were indeed elevated . Notably , in EpiLCs , as in the epiblasts but in contrast to EpiSCs , endoderm markers such as Gata4 , Gata6 , and Sox17 were downregulated or remained at very low levels . Blimp1 , which , apart from PGCs , shows expression in the visceral and deﬁnitive endoderm , was downregulated in EpiLCs , but not in EpiSCs ( Figure 1E and Figures S1B and S1C ) . These ﬁndings indicate that EpiLCs show properties that are consistent with pregastrulating epi - blasts , whereas EpiSCs bear distinct characteristics . PGC - like Cell Induction from EpiLCs We next examined whether the EpiLCs would be induced into PGC - like cells under conditions that fostered induction of the epiblast cells to the PGC fate ( a ﬂoating condition in GMEM with 15 % KSR [ GK15 ] with cytokines including BMP4 ) ( Ohinata et al . , 2009 ) . We ﬁrst induced the ESCs and day ( d ) 1 / 2 / 3 EpiLCs ( ! 1000 cells ) for 2 days and evaluated their BVSC expression . No strong BV induction was observed in any of the aggregates cultured in the GK15 alone or the GK15 with LIF ( Figure 2A and Figure S2A ) . In contrast , when cultured with BMP4 or BMP4 and LIF , robust BV induction ( ! 40 % ) ( BV - positive [ + ] , strongly positive for BV as deﬁned by ﬂuorescence activated cell sorting [ FACS ] ) was observed in the aggregates of d2 and d3 EpiLCs , but not ESCs or d1 EpiLCs ( Figure 2A and Figure S2A ) . We noted that aggregates from d3 EpiLCs were much smaller and looked less integrated compared to those from other origins ( Figure 2A ) . SC was not observed in any of the cultures during the 2 day period ( Figure 2A and Figure S2A ) . Thus , d2 EpiLCs are highly competent to express Blimp1 in response to BMP4 and for subsequent healthy growth . We next examined whether d2 EpiLCs form BVSC ( + ) PGC - like cells when cultured for a longer period . When these cells were cultured in the GK15 alone , no signiﬁcant BVSC induction was observed during the 6 day period ( Figure 2B and Figure S2B ) . When they were cultured with BMP4 , BV was strongly induced on day 2 ( ! 35 . 3 % ) . On day 4 , the aggregates grew well and 2 Cell 146 , 1 – 14 , August 19 , 2011 ª 2011 Elsevier Inc .

On day 6 , the aggre - gates developed further , but the BV ( + ) foci became much smaller ( ! 0 . 4 % ) ( Figure 2B and Figure S2B ) . When the d2 EpiLCs were cultured with BMP4 and LIF , on day 2 , the aggregates showed strong BV positivity ( ! 44 . 5 % ) , and on day 4 , the BV ( + ) cells formed tight and larger clusters ( ! 42 . 0 % ) , some of which ex - hibited SC ( BVSC , ! 7 . 4 % ) . On day 6 , the BVSC ( + ) foci ( BV , ! 5 . 2 % ; BVSC , ! 1 . 0 % ) became smaller but did persist peripher - ally in the aggregates ( Figure 2B and Figure S2B ) . From days 4 to 6 , the BV - negative ( BV - negative [ " ] , negative or weak for BV deﬁned by FACS ) population exhibited rapid expansion ( see below ) . When the d2 EpiLCs were cultured under the full induc - tion condition ( GK15 with BMP4 , BMP8b , LIF , stem cell factor [ SCF ] , and epidermal growth factor [ EGF ] ) , on day 2 , the aggre - gates exhibited strong BV ( ! 41 . 5 % ) , and on day 4 , BV ( + ) cells were located peripherally ( ! 38 . 7 % ) and began to show explicit SC ( BVSC , ! 13 . 5 % ) . On day 6 , the whole aggregates expanded , and the BVSC ( + ) cells covered the aggregates peripherally ( BV , ! 16 . 9 % ; BVSC , ! 7 . 2 % ) ( Figures 2B and 2C and Figure S2B ) . Notably , when the d2 EpiLCs were cultured with BMP8b , SCF , LIF , and EGF or with SCF , LIF , and EGF but without BMP4 , the aggregates looked similar to those cultured only with LIF , and no signiﬁcant BV ( SC ) induction was observed ( Figures S2B and S2C ) . These ﬁndings demonstrate that the d2 EpiLCs are induced into BVSC ( + ) PGC - like cells essentially by BMP4 , and the maintenance / proliferation of the BVSC ( + ) cells is enhanced by LIF and more robustly by the combinatorial effects of LIF , SCF , BMP8b , and EGF . The BVSC ( + ) areas were alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) - positive , and the BVSC ( + ) cells remained up to 10 days under the full induction condition ( Figure S3 ) . We were able to reproduce the induction of BVSC or P14V ( + ) PGC - like cells through the d2 EpiLCs from several independent ESC lines ( Figure S4 ) . In two - dimensional culture , we were unable to ﬁnd a condition under which BV ( SC ) ( + ) cells are induced from the EpiLCs ( data not shown ) . We compared BVSC induction from d2 EpiLCs with that from the epiblasts . The structural development of the aggregates and the efﬁciency and dynamics of BVSC induction from the d2 EpiLCs were similar to those from the epiblasts ( Figure S5A ) : under the full induction condition , on day 2 , a majority of both the d2 EpiLCs and the epiblast cells were shifted toward the BV - positive state , and ! 46 % of the epiblast cells ( as compared to ! 41 . 5 % of d2 EpiLCs ) exhibited strong BV ( Figures S5B and S5C ) , indicating that both cell types bear similar competence to express Blimp1 in response to BMP4 . On days 4 / 6 , the efﬁciency and mode of the emergence of the BVSC ( + ) cells from both cell types were again similar , although the response of the epiblast cells appeared somewhat more cohesive ( Figure S5C ) . These ﬁndings demonstrate that the d2 EpiLCs bear similar , if not iden - tical , properties to the pregastrulating epiblast cells . We evaluated the gene expression dynamics associated with the induction of PGC - like cells ( hereafter called PGCLCs ) from d2 EpiLCs by Q - PCR ( Figure 2D ) . Whereas Oct3 / 4 showed rela - tively constant expression in BV and BVSC ( + ) ( day 2 and days 4 / 6 , respectively ) cells , Sox2 and Nanog were signiﬁcantly re - gained in these cells . Genes speciﬁcally upregulated upon PGC speciﬁcation , including Blimp1 , Prdm14 , Tcfap2c , Nanos3 , stella ( Dppa3 ) , Tdrd5 , and Dnd1 , were all highly elevated in BV ( SC ) ( + ) cells . In contrast , genes associated with a somatic mesodermalprogram , suchas Hoxa1 , Hoxb1 , and Snai1 , showed transient upregulation in BV ( + ) cells at day 2 but subsequently ex - hibited drastic repression in BVSC ( + ) cells at days 4 / 6 . On the other hand , Dnmt3a / 3b , Np95 ( Uhrf1 ) , and c - Myc were monoton - icallydownregulated . Genesassociatedwithlatergermcelldevel - opment , Mvh ( Ddx4 ) and Dazl , showedonlyamodestupregulation in BVSC ( + ) cells . Thus , the gene expression dynamics associated with PGCLC induction are very similar to those associated with PGC speciﬁcation ( Kurimoto et al . , 2008 ; Saitou et al . , 2002 ) . We noted that , at day 6 , the level of endogenous stella mRNA in BV ( + ) SC ( " ) cells was similar to that in BVSC ( + ) cells ( Fig - ure 2E ) . Because the SC expression becomes eminent only after E9 . 5 , 2 . 5 days later than the onset of stella expression ( Ohinata et al . , 2008 ; Saitou et al . , 2002 ) , this ﬁnding indicates that many of the BV ( + ) SC ( " ) cells at a later stage of induction express endogenous stella at a high level and thus should be considered established PGCLCs . Global Transcription Proﬁles of EpiLCs and PGCLCs To determine the global transcription dynamics for PGCLC induction , we isolated total RNAs from ESCs , d1 / 2 / 3 EpiLCs , EpiSCs , E5 . 75 epiblasts , and BVSC - positive PGCLCs at day 6 of induction and stella - EGFP ( + ) PGCs at E9 . 5 ( Payer et al . , 2006 ) . We performed two sets of microarray hybridization : one with nonampliﬁed RNAs from ESCs , d1 / 2 / 3 EpiLCs , EpiSCs , and PGCLCs and the other with ampliﬁed RNAs from ESCs , d2 EpiLCs , EpiSCs , E5 . 75 epiblasts , PGCLCs , and E9 . 5 PGCs . Unsupervised hierarchical clustering ( UHC ) of nonampliﬁed samples showed that two independent samples from ESCs , d1 / 2 / 3 EpiLCs , EpiSCs , and PGCLCs were clustered tightly together ( Figure 3A ) , reﬂecting the reproducibility of the PGCLC induction . Principal component analysis ( PCA ) provided ESCs , d1 , d2 , and d3 EpiLCs with PC2 scores of progressively in - creasing values , suggesting that EpiLC induction from ESCs is a directional and progressive process ( Figure 3B ) . EpiSCs were clustered distantly from the other samples ( Figure 3A ) , indicating their divergence from the other cell types . UHC of ampliﬁed samples showed that , ﬁrst , two independent samples from all cell types were again clustered together , and second , d2 EpiLCs and PGCLCs were clustered most closely with E5 . 75 epiblasts and E9 . 5 PGCs , respectively , whereas EpiSCs were clustered distantly from the other cell types ( Fig - ure 3C ) . Scatter plot analysis demonstrated close similarities between d2 EpiLCs and E5 . 75 epiblasts and between PGCLCs and E9 . 5 PGCs and a relatively large difference between EpiSCs and E5 . 75 epiblasts ( Figure 3D ) . We plotted all cell types in a three - dimensional space deﬁned by three major parameters generated by PCA ( Figure 3F ) . Notably , the pathway of PGCLC induction from d2 EpiLCs was parallel to that of E9 . 5 PGC forma - tion from E5 . 75 epiblasts ( Figure 3F ) . Furthermore , EpiSC deriva - tion from epiblasts involves a discrete pathway ( Figure 3F ) , reﬂected by a distinct PC1 ( representing 61 % of the total variance ) score . These ﬁndings indicate strongly that PGCLC formation from ESCs through EpiLCs is a recapitulation of PGC formation from epiblasts .

EpiSCs upregulated more genes associated with the development of a variety of organ systems ( heart , blood vessels , kidneys , muscle , and bone ) than E5 . 75 epiblasts and d2 EpiLCs ( Figure 3E and Table S2 ) , demonstrating that EpiSCs acquire more developmentally advanced characteristics than E5 . 75 epiblasts and d2 EpiLCs .

ESCs , and in E9 . 5 PGCs and PGCLCs in comparison to epiblasts and EpiLCs , respec - tively , are listed in Table S2 and Table S3 . Epigenetic Proﬁles of the PGCLCs We next evaluated the epigenetic proﬁles of PGCLCs . IF analysis revealed that BV ( SC ) ( + ) PGCLCs at day 6 appeared to have reduced H3K9me2 and cytosine methylation ( 5mC ) and instead showed elevated H3K27me3 levels , as compared to non - PGCLCs ( Figures 4A , 4B and 4D ) . To conﬁrm this observation , we quan - tiﬁed the dynamics of H3K9me2 , H3K27me3 , and 5mC levels during the PGCLC induction by western / dot blot analysis . In ESC to EpiLC differentiation , the H3K9me2 and 5mC levels increased . In contrast , in EpiLC to PGCLC dif - ferentiation , they decreased signiﬁcantly . Non - PGCLCs retained relatively high levels of H3K9me2 and 5mC ( Figures 4C and 4E ) . On the other hand , in ESC to EpiLC differentiation , the H3K27me3 level decreased , and in EpiLC to PGCLC differentiation , it in turn increased . Non - PGCLCs retained a similar level of H3K27me3 to EpiLCs ( Figure 4C ) . Thus , the dynamics of histone modiﬁcation and 5mC changes during PGCLC formation are a recapit - ulation of those observed during PGC forma - tion ( Seki et al . , 2005 ) . We determined the imprinting states of maternally ( Snrpn , Kcnq1ot1 ) and paternally ( Igf2r , H19 ) imprinted genes in PGCLCs . Whereas the PGCLCs did retain methylation of Igf2r and Snrpn , they appeared to have a slightly reduced level of methylation of H19 and Kcnq1ot1 , suggesting that PGCLCs may be initiating the process of imprint erasure ( Figure 4F ) . A global decrease of 5mC with a relative maintenance of imprinting in PGCLCs is a characteristic that is consistent with that of migrating PGCs ( Lee et al . , 2002 ) . 6 Cell 146 , 1 – 14 , August 19 , 2011 ª 2011 Elsevier Inc .

At day 6 , the average number of BV ( + ) cells was 2222 ( ! 12 % ) , among which 848 cells were SC ( + ) ( ! 5 % ) , whereas that of BV ( " ) cells was 15811 ( ! 88 % ) . The cell cycle analysis revealed that BV ( + ) cells , especially BVSC ( + ) cells at days 4 / 6 , were enriched in the G2 phase , whereas BV ( " ) cells exhibited proﬁles similar to those of cycling somatic cells , especially at days 4 / 6 ( Figure 4H ) . Consistently , PGCLCs showed little BrdU incorporation during the 6 hr culture on day 4 of induction , whereas non - PGCLCs actively incorporated BrdU ( Figure 4I ) . Collectively , these data indicate that BV induc - tion from EpiLCs is an efﬁcient process , and presumably all of the BV ( + ) cells initiate stella expression thereafter ( irrespective of their SC positivity ; see above ) , but the induced BV ( SC ) ( + ) cells proliferate slowly ( one to two divisions from day 2 to day 6 ) , whereas BV ( " ) cells grow more rapidly ( three to four divisions ) . The slow growth and the arrest at the G2 phase of the cell cycle are key characteristics of migrating PGCs ( Seki et al . , 2007 ) , and the ﬁnding that PGCLCs bear equivalent properties provides further evidence that PGCLC formation is a reconstitution of PGC formation . Spermatogenesis and Normal Offspring from PGCLCs A cell’s ability to contribute to spermatogenesis is the most strin - gent index of whether it has become a male germ cell . We next examined whether the PGCLCs undergo proper spermatogen - esis by transplanting them into the seminiferous tubules of W / W v neonatal mice lacking endogenous germ cells ( Chuma et al . , 2005 ) . We induced the PGCLCs for 6 days , transplanted dissociated single cells from the entire aggregates or the FACS - sorted BV ( + ) cells ( ! 10 4 cells / testis ) , and evaluated the recipients after 10 weeks . All of the testes transplanted with non - sorted cells developed teratomas , but those transplanted with the BV ( + ) cells did not ( Table 1 ) . Instead , three out of six testes transplanted with the BV ( + ) cells harbored seminiferous tubules with proper spermatogenesis : these tubules contained dark central sections corresponding to spermiation and were much thicker than those without spermatogenesis ( Figure 5A and Table 1 ) . Indeed , the thick tubules contained abundant sperma - tozoa with normal morphology and showed a robust wave of spermatogenesis , whereas the thin tubules contained only Ser - toli cells ( Figure 5A ) . The efﬁciency of the colonization of the PGCLCs was comparable to that of PGCs in vivo ( Chuma et al . , 2005 ; Ohinata et al . , 2009 ) . We fertilized the oocytes with the spermatozoa derived from PGCLCs by intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) . The resul - tant zygotes developed normally , and by the blastocyst stage , embryos from PGCLC - derived sperm exhibited strong expres - sion of SC derived from the donor genome ( Figure 5B ) . We transferred the embryos to foster mothers , which gave rise to grossly healthy offspring with normal placentas and imprinting patterns ( Figures 5C , 5D , and 5F ) . The BV and SC transgenes were positive in 13 and 7 of 21 offspring , respectively ( Figure 5C ) , consistent with the transmission of the transgenes through haploid donor spermatozoa . The male and female offspring from the PGCLCs developed normally and grew into fertile adults ( Figures 5D and 5E and Table S5 ) . These ﬁndings demon - strate that the PGCLCs are comparable to PGCs in their function as male germ cells . Identiﬁcation of Surface Markers for PGCLC Isolation Identiﬁcation of surface markers delineating a pure population of PGCLCs is essential for isolating PGCLCs bearing no transgenic reporters , such as those induced from iPSCs or ESCs from various mammalian species , including humans ( Saitou and Yamaji , 2010 ) . We screened surface markers ( SSEA1 , PECAM1 , EPCAM , N - cadherin , Integrin - b 3 , Integrin - a V , CXCR4 , and KIT ) and their combinations to identify those that deﬁne the BV ( + ) population . When aggregates of BVSC d2 EpiLCs induced for 6 days were FACS sorted by SSEA1 and Integrin - b 3 , they were divided into three major subpopulations ( P1 [ SSEA1 high , Integ - rin - b 3 high ] , P2 [ SSEA1 high , Integrin - b 3 low ] , and P3 [ SSEA1 low , Integrin - b 3 high / low ] ) . Notably , more than 99 % of the cells in P1 were BV ( + ) , whereas only 1 . 2 % and 1 . 7 % of the cells in P2 and P3 , respectively , contained BV ( + ) cells ( Figure 6A ) , indi - cating that P1 is nearly identical to the BV ( + ) population .

Although the sorting pattern of these aggregates was somewhat different than that of the aggregates from BVSC ESCs , we identiﬁed three similar subpopulations ( Figure 6B ) . We compared the expression levels of the 20 genes analyzed in Figure 2D between these subpopu - lations and the BV ( + ) PGCLCs . The expression levels of the 20 genes in P1 correlated well with those in BV ( + ) PGCLCs ( R 2 = 0 . 80 ) , whereas those in the other two subpopulations showed poor correlation ( Figure 6B ) . To examine whether the P1 subpopulation from AAG ESCs contributes to the spermatogenesis , we transplanted them , as well as the whole population , into the seminiferous tubules of W / W v mice and evaluated the recipients after 8 weeks . We found teratomas in all of the testes transplanted with the whole popu - lation , whereas no teratomas were detected in the testes with the P1 subpopulation , and indeed , ﬁve out of six testes demon - strated proper spermatogenesis with GFP ﬂuorescence by the AAG transgenes ( Figures 6C – 6G and Table 1 ) . With ICSI followed by embryo transfer , the resultant sperm contributed to fertile offspring ( Figure 6H and Table S5 ) . These ﬁndings demonstrate that the sorting by SSEA1 and Integrin - b 3 puriﬁes PGCLCs with essentially no contamination of teratogenic cells , establishing the formation and puriﬁcation of PGCLCs from ESCs without relevant transgenic markers . PGCLCs , Spermatogenesis , and Offspring from iPSCs Finally , we explored whether the germ cell speciﬁcation pathway would be reconstituted by iPSCs . We used three iPSC lines , 20D17 ( Okita et al . , 2007 ) , 178B - 5 ( Nakagawa et al . , 2008 ) , and 492B - 4 ( Okita et al . , 2008 ) , all bearing Nanog - EGFP ( NG ) trans - genes . They all expressed NG in the ground state and exhibited differentiation into EpiLCs with proper morphology and NG downregulation ( Figures S6A , S6D , and S6G ) . Upon PGCLC induction , they showed NG upregulation as early as day 2 , and NG - positive cells formed clusters around the periphery of the aggregates at days 4 / 6 ( Figures S6B , S6E , and S6H ) . We FACS sorted the induced aggregates at day 6 by SSEA1 and Integrin - b 3 . The sorting patterns of the three lines were somewhat different from one another , and that of the 20D17 line was more similar to those of the ESC lines ( Figure 6I and Figures S6C , S6F , and S6I ) . In aggregates of the 20D17 line , NG - positive cells represented ! 57 % ( Figure S6C ) . Consistent with the characteristics of migrating PGCs , the P1 subpopulation contained both NG - high and NG - low cells ( Figure S6C ) ( Yama - guchi et al . , 2005 ) . On the other hand , the P2 subpopulation was rich in NG - high cells and was thus probably an undifferenti - ated population ( Figure S6C ) . The expression levels of the 20 genes analyzed in Figure 2D in the P1 subpopulation from the 20D17 line exhibited a prominent correlation with those in BV ( + ) PGCLCs ( R 2 = 0 . 96 ) , whereas those in the other two subpopulations showed a poor correlation ( Figure 6I ) . We transplanted the P1 cells from the three lines into the seminiferous tubules of W / W v mice and evaluated the recip - ients after 10 weeks . No testes with cells from the 178B - 5 or 492B - 4 lines showed spermatogenesis , and two with the 178B - 5 cells resulted in teratomas ( Table 1 ) . Remarkably , 3 out of 18 testes with the cells from the 20D17 line exhibited proper spermatogenesis , and we observed no teratomas in the recipi - ents of this line ( Figure 6J and Table 1 ) . With ICSI followed by embryo transfer , the resultant sperm contributed to fertile offspring ( Figure 6K and Table S5 ) . Notably , some of the offspring died prematurely , apparently due to tumors around the neck region ( data not shown ) , similar to those observed in some of the F1 offspring of the 20D17 chimeras ( Okita et al . , 2007 ) . These ﬁndings demonstrate that , although iPSCs exhibit different induction properties depending on the lines , they can nonetheless form PGCLCs with proper function . DISCUSSION We induced pregastrulating epiblast - like cells , EpiLCs , from ground state ESCs that were maintained by 2i and LIF under a serum - and feeder - free condition . ESCs cultured in the pres - ence of serum show substantial heterogeneity ( Hayashi et al . , 2008 ) and were inadequate for the uniform induction of EpiLCs ( data not shown ) . EpiLC induction involves ActA and bFGF , the same cytokines that are required for the derivation of EpiSCs , as well as the addition of 1 % KSR . d2 EpiLCs were robustly induced into the PGC fate , but ESCs , d1 / 3 EpiLCs , and EpiSCs were not ( Figure 2 ) . This should be a reﬂection of the fact that only epiblasts at E5 . 5 ! E6 . 0 serve as an efﬁcient precursor for the PGC fate ( Ohinata et al . , 2009 ) . The self - renewing EpiSCs show a signiﬁcant heterogeneity ( Figure S1 ) ( Hayashi et al . , 2008 ) and a substantially different transcriptome from the orig - inal epiblasts ( Figure 3 ) , indicating that continuous stimulation by ActA and bFGF stabilizes the properties of the epiblast - derived cells ( EpiSCs ) in a condition that is different than their original states . It is of note that , when EpiSCs were reverted into ESC - like cells ( Greber et al . , 2010 ) , they were induced into PGCLCs through EpiLCs ( Figure S7 ) . Wnt3 is required for competence for the PGC fate ( Ohinata et al . , 2009 ) . EpiLCs express Wnt3 at a level similar to that in the epiblasts ( Figure 1E ) , and this would confer the PGC compe - tence to EpiLCs . Addition of exogenous Wnt3a during EpiLC induction , however , had no additive effects on the properties of EpiLCs or their capacity to form PGCLCs ( data not shown ) . Notably , EpiSCs also express a high level of Wnt3 yet are inefﬁ - cient for the PGC fate ( Figure 1E and Figure S1 ) . The compe - tence for the PGC fate would therefore be a complex trait gov - erned by both the signaling and epigenetic states of the cells . The precise mechanism conferring the competence for the PGC fate warrants further investigation . The derivation of EpiLCs has critical implications in stem cell biology . For example , the ESC to EpiLC differentiation serves as a model for the investigation of the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms underlying the ICM to epiblast differentiation . A comprehensive comparison of genetic and epigenetic properties among ESCs , EpiLCs , and EpiSCs would lead to a better under - standing of the naive and primed pluripotency ( Nichols and Smith , 2009 ) . More practically , EpiLCs may serve as a starting material for the induction of other lineages derived from the epiblast . The EpiLCs are a transient entity and undergo relatively large - scale cell death after day 2 of induction via an unknown mechanism . They have been difﬁcult to maintain longer than Cell 146 , 1 – 14 , August 19 , 2011 ª 2011 Elsevier Inc . 9 Please cite this article in press as : Hayashi et al . , Reconstitution of the Mouse Germ Cell Speciﬁcation Pathway in Culture by Pluripotent Stem Cells , Cell ( 2011 ) , doi : 10 . 1016 / j . cell . 2011 . 06 . 052 Figure 5 .

They thus may require additional cytokines or a different condition for their maintenance . None - theless , EpiLC derivation from ESCs is a straightforward process , providing a strategy for in vitro reconstitution of lineage speciﬁcation . A previous report showed that ESCs can be converted into early primitive ectoderm - like cells ( EPLCs ) ( Rathjen et al . , 1999 ) . In that study , the EPLCs were shown to self - renew and bear epiblast - like gene expression and morphology . In addition , like the epiblasts , they were unable to contribute to chimeras when injected into blastocysts . However , their derivation in - volved serum and an undeﬁned HepG2 - conditioned medium , and their further properties , such as genome - wide gene expres - sion , were not investigated . Therefore , whether EPLCs might truly represent a pregastrulating epiblast - like state and serve as a suitable precursor for PGC - like cells will require further investigation . Upon PGCLC induction , a majority of d2 EpiLCs initiate BV expression , with ! 40 % acquiring strong BV levels on day 2 ( Fig - ure 2C , Figure S2 , and Figure S5 ) . We therefore assume that , upon induction , a majority of d2 EpiLCs are directed toward the PGC fate , and those ( ! 40 % ) that acquire Blimp1 at a sufﬁ - cient level succeed in progressing toward PGCLCs with appro - priate genetic , epigenetic , and cellular properties , whereas those that fail to do so , due to some stochastic / physical parameter or intrinsic difference , result in a nongerm cell trait . In good agree - ment with this assumption , the BV ( SC ) ( + ) cell induction from the epiblasts ex vivo exhibited similar dynamics ( Figure S5 ) . Further - more , among the cells originated from the most proximal epiblasts , only those that acquire high , but not low , levels of Blimp1 develop into PGCs in vivo ( Kurimoto et al . , 2008 ) . We noted , however , that the response of the epiblasts was some - what more cohesive than that of EpiLCs ( Figure S5 ) . In part , this may be because EpiLCs are dissociated into single cells and reaggregated upon induction , whereas epiblasts are tightly adhering , perhaps highly synchronized , epithelial structures at the outset . Further elaboration of the EpiLC / PGCLC induction protocol may lead to more efﬁcient generation of PGCLCs . The identiﬁcation of surface markers for PGCLCs ( SSEA - 1 and Integrin - b 3 ) has enabled the induction and puriﬁcation of PGCLCs with a capacity for proper spermatogenesis from iPSCs ( Figure 6 ) . Upon PGCLC induction , the three iPSC lines exhibited different differentiation properties ( Figure 6 and Figure S6 ) . Consistent with the fact that 20D17 has the highest capacity for germline transmission among the three lines ( Okita et al . , 2007 ) ( K . Okita and S . Yamanaka , personal communication ) , only the PGCLCs from 20D17 exhibited spermatogenesis in our trials ( Figure 6 and Table 1 ) . Indeed , it has been shown recently that the efﬁciency of germline transmission of iPSCs depends highly on the introduction of the Myc transgene ( Naka - gawa et al . , 2010 ) : 20D17 was derived by retroviral stable trans - duction of c - Myc , whereas the other two lines were derived without , or by transient expression of , c - Myc ( Nakagawa et al . , 2008 ; Okita et al . , 2007 , 2008 ) . Thus , the efﬁciency of the contri - bution to the spermatogenesis of the PGCLCs derived from the iPSCs depends on the original properties of the iPSC lines . The surface marker identiﬁcation for PGCLCs may also be useful for the puriﬁcation of PGCLCs from ESCs of other mammalian species , including humans . It should be noted that hESCs have substantially different properties than mESCs but exhibit characteristics similar to mEpiSCs ( Brons et al . , 2007 ; Tesar et al . , 2007 ; Thomson et al . , 1998 ) . However , hESCs and mEpiSCs do show differences in their gene expression , tran - scription factor dependency , and responses to signaling mole - cules ( Chia et al . , 2010 ; Greber et al . , 2010 ) . Thus , to establish a deﬁned methodology for inducing proper PGCLCs from hESCs , careful studies on the nature of hESCs and on the mech - anism of PGC speciﬁcation in primate models would be critical . The mechanism for PGC speciﬁcation / development has been difﬁcult to explore , mainly because PGCs are small in num - ber and refractory to proliferation in vitro ( Saitou and Yamaji , 2010 ) . Our culture system readily allows the generation of PGCLCs in a relatively large number ( ! 10 5 – 10 6 ) and thus should serve as a foundation for elucidating areas of germ cell biology that have thus far been unexplored due to material limitations , e . g . , the biochemical properties of key proteins involved in PGC speciﬁcation / proliferation / survival , the mechanism of epi - genetic reprogramming in PGCs , etc . Continued investigations aimed at in vitro reconstitution of germ cell development , including the induction of female PGCLCs and their descen - dants , will be crucial for a more comprehensive understanding of germ cell biology in general , as well as for the advancement of reproductive technology and medicine . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES The experimental procedures for animal experiments , FACS analysis , Q - PCR , microarray analysis , bisulﬁte sequencing , genotyping , AP staining , immuno - histochemistry , western / dot blot analysis , and BrdU incorporation are avail - able in the Extended Experimental Procedures . ESC Derivation and Culture The blastocysts bearing the BVSC and ROSA transgenes ( B6 ; 129S - Gt [ ROSA ] 26Sor / J ; theJackson Laboratory ) were ﬂushed outfrom theuterus atE3 . 5and placed and cultured in a well of a 96 - well plate in N2B27 medium with 2i ( PD0325901 , 0 . 4 m M : Stemgent , San Diego , CA ; CHIR99021 , 3 m M : Stemgent ) andLIF ( 1000u / ml ) onmouseembryonicfeeders ( MEFs ) ( Yingetal . , 2008 ) . The expanded ESC colonies were passaged by dissociating with TrypLE ( Invitro - gen ) . Until passage 4 , the ESCs were maintained on MEFs . At passage 4 , the ESCs were stocked in Cell Banker 3 solution ( ZENOAQ ) . Thereafter , male ESCs were thawed , cultured , and maintained feeder - free on a dish coated withpoly - L - ornithine ( 0 . 01 % ; Sigma ) and laminin ( 10ng / ml ; BDBiosci - ences ) .

The cells were passaged every 3 days by dissociating with collagenase IV ( 1 mg / ml ; Invitrogen ) as cell clumps , and the cells bearing the typical morphology of EpiSCs were estab - lished after around 10 passages . Induction of EpiLCs and PGCLCs The EpiLCs were induced by plating 1 . 0 3 10 5 ESCs / iPSCs on a well of a 12 - well plate coated with human plasma ﬁbronectin ( 16 . 7 m g / ml ) in N2B27 medium containing activin A ( 20 ng / ml ) , bFGF ( 12 ng / ml ) , and KSR ( 1 % ) . The medium was changed every day . The PGCLCs were induced under a ﬂoating condition by plating 1 . 0 3 10 3 EpiLCs in a well of a low - cell - binding U - bottom 96 - well plate ( NUNC ) in a serum - free medium ( GK15 ; GMEM [ Invitrogen ] with 15 % KSR , 0 . 1mMNEAA , 1mMsodiumpyruvate , 0 . 1mM2 - mercaptoethanol , 100 U / ml penicillin , 0 . 1 mg / ml streptomycin , and 2 mM L - glutamine ) in the presence of the cytokines BMP4 ( 500 ng / ml ; R & D Systems ) , LIF ( 1000 u / ml ; Invitrogen ) , SCF ( 100 ng / ml ; R & D Systems ) , BMP8b ( 500 ng / ml ; R & D Systems ) , and EGF ( 50 ng / ml ; R & D Systems ) .

Recipient animals ( neonatal [ 7 - to 9 - day - old ] W / W v mice lacking endogenous spermatogenesis [ Mintz and Russell , 1957 ] from a WB 3 C57BL / 6 F1 background [ SLC ] ) were induced into hypothermic anesthesia on ice , and the donor cell suspension ( the whole - cell dissociates or the FACS - sorted cells [ ! 2 m l ] [ Table 1 ] ) was injected into the efferent duct of each testis ( Ogawa et al . , 1997 ) . The recipient animals were returned to their littermates after surgery . The spermatozoa derived from the PGCLCs were prepared from the semi - niferous tubules of recipient testis at 8 – 10 weeks after transplantation .

EpiSCs maintained on MEFs in N2B27mediumcontainingactivinA ( 20ng / ml ; Peprotech ) , bFGF ( 12ng / ml ; In - vitrogen ) , and KSR ( 20 % ; Invitrogen ) were passaged as clumps onto a dish without MEFs in N2B27 medium containing 2i , LIF , and KSR ( 20 % ) . After 2 days , the cells were passaged as single cells in the same medium . After afurther3days , thecellswerepassagedassinglecellsinN2B27mediumcon - tainingonly2iandLIF .
