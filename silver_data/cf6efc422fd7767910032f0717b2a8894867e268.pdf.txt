Delineating the scientiﬁc footprint in technology : Identifying scientiﬁc publications within non - patent references Julie Callaert • Joris Grouwels • Bart Van Looy Received : 29 November 2011 / Published online : 21 December 2011 (cid:2) Akade´miai Kiado´ , Budapest , Hungary 2011 Abstract Indicators based on non - patent references ( NPRs ) are increasingly being used for measuring and assessing science – technology interactions . But NPRs in patent docu - ments contain noise , as not all of them can be considered ‘scientiﬁc’ . In this article , we introduce the results of a machine - learning algorithm that allows identifying scientiﬁc references in an automated manner . Using the obtained results , we analyze indicators based on NPRs , with a focus on the difference between NPR - and scientiﬁc non - patent refer - ences - based indicators . Differences between both indicators are signiﬁcant and dependent on the considered patent system , the applicant country and the technological domain . These results signal the relevancy of delineating scientiﬁc references when using NPRs to assess the occurrence and impact of science – technology interactions .

Indicators derived from non - patent references ( NPRs ) within patent documents are very popular in this respect ( see e . g . Verbeek et al . 2002 ) . In spite of some discussion about their actual meaning ( Nelson 2009 ) , scientiﬁc references in patents are in any case indicative of relatedness or closeness Authors appear in alphabetical order .

The presence of scientiﬁc references in the front page section of a patented invention indeed signals the relevancy of these references for assessing and qualifying the claims of the invention . As such , indicators based on scientiﬁc references in patents provide useful additional information on science - technology related - ness or vicinity , at least if their presence displays sufﬁcient levels of occurrence ( Callaert et al . 2006 ) . Given the widespread and consistent availability of reliable and comprehensive patent databases , indicators based on scientiﬁc references in patent documents bear the potential to provide a systematic view on science – technology interactions . At the same time , NPRs in patent documents contain noise . Several efforts have been made in the past to assess different types of NPRs . Narin and Noma ( 1985 ) reported an average of 0 . 3 NPRs per patent of which about 75 % are considered scientiﬁc : 48 % were journals , 15 % were books and 11 % were abstracts . Van Vianen et al . ( 1990 ) observed that 55 . 7 % of NPRs in Dutch patents were journal citations , the others were mostly books and abstract services . Harhoff et al . ( 2003 ) reported similar ﬁgures : whereas 60 % of NPRs were considered ‘scientiﬁc’ references , the remaining 40 % referred to trade journals , ﬁrm pub - lications or standard texts in technical ﬁelds . Callaert et al . ( 2006 ) , when analysing a sample of 10 , 000 EPO and USPTO NPRs , found that more than half of them were journal articles . The remaining references included conference proceedings , industry - related documents , and reference books or databases . Guan and He ( 2007 ) analyzed Chinese US patents for the period 1995 – 2004 . They found that 70 % of all NPRs referred to journal articles or con - ference proceedings . He and Deng ( 2007 ) analyzed a smaller subset of 850 New Zealand USPTO patents , granted between 1976 and 2004 , and found that 65 % of NPRs referred to the ( ISI indexed and non - indexed ) scientiﬁc literature . The other references referred to company catalogs , manuals , newspapers , gene / plant bank records and patent documents . Lo ( 2010 ) analyzed NPRs in US genetic engineering patents , granted between 1980 and 2004 . Com - pared to the other studies , a considerably higher portion of NPRs referred to journals ( 90 % ) , which is likely due to the speciﬁc subﬁeld under study . The remaining references referred to Gene Bank , monographs , technical reports , product catalogs , news items , theses , as well as other patents . Hence , within the growing literature on science – technology relatedness , and patent based indicators for measuring them , several efforts have been made for further identifying and characterizing NPRs in patents . And even though some non - journal reference categories may still be considered scientiﬁc in a broader sense , it is clear that not all NPRs are stemming from scientiﬁc sources . Therefore , if one is interested in identifying those traces of prior art that refer to scientiﬁc research per se—i . e . references to serial peer - reviewed scientiﬁc literature ( journals ) and proceedings—the large scale identiﬁcation of the scientiﬁc character of NPRs becomes highly relevant . The identiﬁcation methods that have been reported on in the lit - erature are at the same time mostly developed ad hoc , and tailored for the speciﬁc application and subset of patents under study . In this article , a method for identiﬁcation is developed and applied to study the occurrence of actual scientiﬁc references within NPRs on large scale . We then analyze to what extent NPR - based indicators vary , depending on whether only scientiﬁc versus all NPRs are taken into account . We consider two NPR - based indicators of the science relatedness of patents . First , the proportion of patents with at least one scientiﬁc non - patent reference provides an indication of the ‘extent’ to which science is present within technology . Second , the number of cited scientiﬁc NPRs per ( citing ) patent reﬂects the science ‘intensity’ of technology . Both indicators are not only compared with their counterparts based on all NPRs : the presence and impact of contingencies—in terms of patent system ( EPO vs . US - PTO , technology ﬁeld and country ( national innovation system ) —are analyzed as well . 384 J . Callaert et al . 123 The article is structured as follows : ﬁrst we describe the methodology and algorithms used to identify scientiﬁc non - patent references ( SNPRs ) . Next , we analyze and compare the obtained indicators in terms of occurrence and contingencies . Overall , our observations reveal non - trivial differences for both indicators . Methodology for characterizing NPRs A supervised machine learning approach was deployed for classifying NPRs . Machine learning algorithms employ datasets in which every instance ( or record ) is represented using the same set of features . Supervised machine learning methods start from instances with a priori known labels ( i . e . with the corresponding correct outputs ) . This contrasts with unsupervised learning methods ( such as clustering methods ) , where all instances are unlabelled a priori and the researcher hopes to identify unknown but useful classes from the bottom up . For our application , where it is known in advance which classes are sought for ( namely scientiﬁc vs . non - scientiﬁc references ) , supervised machine learning methods are most suitable . In supervised machine learning methods , the goal is to predict class labels based on available features . The resulting classiﬁer is in a next step used to assign class labels to the instances where the values of the predictor features are known , but for which the value of the class label is unknown . This process is called inductive machine learning as a set of rules are derived from instances ( a training set ) and then applied to the broader population ; or—more generally—a classiﬁer is created that can be used to generalize to new instances ( Bishop 2006 ; Kotsiantis 2007 ; Hastie and Friedman 2009 ) . In order to arrive at an algorithm that allows delineating scientiﬁc references , a ‘learning set’ was created , consisting of 25 , 783 NPRs . These references were selected randomly from 7 , 582 , 096 NPRs , pertaining to all EPO , USPTO and PCT patent documents that are included in the EPO Worldwide Patent Statistical Database PATSTAT ( April 2008 ver - sion ) . Each reference in the sample was classiﬁed by a team of researchers ( n = 5 ) as being either ‘Journal’ , ‘Proceedings’ or ‘Non - scientiﬁc’ ( e . g . manuals , patent abstracts , … ) . A category ‘Maybe’ was included to designate inconclusive cases ( e . g . N . N . ( year ) ) . In total 12 , 465 NPRs or almost 50 % received the label ‘Journal’ ; 2 , 037 or 8 % were classiﬁed as ‘Proceedings’ ; 10 , 411 NPRs or 41 % were non - scientiﬁc . A minor 1 % ( 360 NPRs ) were doubtful hence labelled ‘Maybe’ . In a next step , all categorized references were parsed , indexed and stemmed in order to create a document by term - matrix that consists of 25 , 783 rows ( references ) and 74 , 127 columns ( unique stemmed terms ) . Cell values equal the frequency of occurrence of each document by term combination . 1 As in most text mining settings , this matrix is very sparse . Contrary to most text - mining applications , no weighting was applied . The main purpose of weighting schemes ( e . g . TF - IDF ) , is to diminish the weight of the terms that occur very often in order to increase the discriminatory power of documents of a more idiosyncratic nature . However , for our particular purpose ( i . e . classiﬁcation of a reference to be scientiﬁc or not ) , words that occur often can be very signiﬁcant . For example , the two most occurring words in the sample index are ‘‘et’’ and ‘‘al’’ . Their presence in a reference might be a strong indication of the reference being scientiﬁc and hence their ( potential ) impact should not be jeopardized by weighting . 1 See Salton et al . ( 1975 ) on vector space models as well as Magerman et al . ( 2010 ) for a more elaborated account on vector space models for patent and publication documents . Delineating the scientiﬁc footprint in technology 385 123 In order to assess the robustness of the algorithm , a Monte Carlo - process was used to partition the learning set 10 times in a random way . For each of the partitions , a test set was kept separately for veriﬁcation purposes ( consisting of 30 % of the references ) . The clas - siﬁer was developed on the references in the partitioned learning sets , excluding the respective test sets . This implies that classiﬁers were developed on smaller Document - by - Term - matrices , even more so as unique terms were eliminated . This results in 10 differ - ent—but partially overlapping—training sets ( each consisting of about 17 , 500 documents and ± 56 , 600 terms ) with their respective test sets of about 8 , 500 documents . Each one of these training sets generates its own classiﬁer , which means that the process yields 10 different classiﬁers . If the results of these classiﬁers on their test sets are similar , it reinforces conﬁdence that any classiﬁer that is generated in this way will yield similar results , also on the rest of the NPR - population . For each of the 10 training sets , the terms ( i . e . all terms that occur in the training set ) are ordered by their frequency . Only terms that occur in 10 or more documents over the complete sample of 25 . 000 references are withheld , as a certain term has to occur fre - quently enough in order to have ‘predictive’ power for the dataset as a whole . This resulted in 4 , 148 terms being withheld for the development of the qualiﬁer . Next , a principal component analysis was performed on the training sets . The main purpose of this step is not dimensionality reduction , but de - correlating the variables . Highly correlated variables tend to be linearly dependent , which makes the covariance matrix positive semi - deﬁnite , while the discriminant analysis algorithms require positive deﬁnite covariance matrices . Retaining 99 % of the variance removes the dimensions with an eigenvalue numerically equivalent to zero , solving the problem while retaining almost all information in the dataset . By applying a 99 % threshold of withheld variance , 3 , 500 components are obtained . Next , the obtained eigenvalues were multiplied with the absolute value of the correlation of their respective component with the outcome variable . These scores were used to rank the components . Throughout different simulations , the number of dimensions used to arrive at a classiﬁer ( based on discriminant analysis ) has been set equal to 10 , 50 , 100 , 500 , 1 , 000 and 3 , 500 components . The obtained ﬁndings reveal that the optimal amount of components for classiﬁcation purposes amounts to 1 , 000 . When all dimensions are kept , over - ﬁtting occurs as performance on the training sets keeps on rising , while the performance on the test sets starts to diminish . The classiﬁer is obtained by performing a linear discriminant analysis , where the characterization of the NPR is the result of a linear function of all terms present in the reference . An excerpt of the resulting parameters for this function ( top 20 terms in absolute coefﬁcient value ) is added in Table 7 of Appendix . Negative coefﬁcients mean that the concerned terms point towards non - scientiﬁc references ( e . g . ‘genbank’ , referring to the genetic sequence database of the NIH ; and ‘catalog’ , referring to sales or product cata - logues ) . A higher positive coefﬁcient means that the concerned term is more likely to be part of scientiﬁc reference ( e . g . ‘confer’ : referring to conference proceedings ; and ‘pna’ : referring to the often cited PNAS : Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ) . The accuracy of the resulting classiﬁer is assessed by calculating the correct classiﬁ - cation rates , i . e . the amount of correctly classiﬁed NPRs ( when comparing to the a priori classiﬁcation that was done by the researchers ) , divided by the total number of NPRs in the respective sets . The accuracy level , obtained for the training sets , equals 94 . 1 % . For the test sets , an accuracy level of 92 % is obtained . Moreover , the different simulations gen - erate highly congruent outcomes , signalling the robustness of the overall approach ( Table 1 shows the results for the 10 Monte Carlo runs on the training and test sets ) . 386 J .

In what follows , we analyze indicators based on NPRs , whereby we are primarily interested in the difference between NPR - and SNPR - based indicators . For these analyses , we consider EPO ( applications and grants ) and USPTO ( grants ) patent documents with application years between 2000 and 2009 , and with applicant countries in EU15 , Swit - zerland , US , Canada , Japan and Korea . Indicators are broken down by patent system ( EPO vs . USPTO ) , by application year , by applicant country and by technology domain— according to the FhG19 classiﬁcation ; which has been developed by the German Fraun - hofer Institute of Systems and Innovation Research , the French patent ofﬁce and the French Observatoire des Sciences et des Techniques , and which is based on the International Patent Classiﬁcation ( Schmoch 2008 ) . Full counting schemes are used for patents that are assigned to different countries and technology ﬁelds . Starting from the number of patents , we calculate for each year / patent system / country / ﬁeld combination : ( 1 ) the average number of patents with NPRs , ( 2 ) the average number of NPRs , ( 3 ) the extent to which science is present in patent documents , measured as the proportion of patents with NPRs and ﬁnally ( 4 ) the science intensity measured as the average number of NPRs per ( citing ) patent . Each indicator is calculated twice : once using all NPRs and once using only scientiﬁc NPRs . Analyses and results Difference between NPR - based and SNPR - based indicators Scientiﬁc NPRs represent a fraction of all non - patent literature . In Table 2 , the differences between NPR - and SNPR - based indicators are shown , and their signiﬁcance is evaluated using a paired - sample t test . Results are presented for EPO and USPTO patents separately , as well as for the aggregate set of EPO and USPTO patents . Table 2 ﬁrst reveals some differences between reference - based indicators for EPO and USPTO patents . USPTO patents have considerably higher volumes of references and of patents with references . Also in terms of impact , USPTO patents contain approximately 2 . 5 to 4 times more ( S ) NPRs per patent than EPO patents . These observations hold for NPR - as well as SNPR - based indicators and are in line with ﬁndings from previous studies . They largely result from different citation requirements and philosophies at the USPTO ( duty of disclosure ; documentary search ) and at the EPO system ( no duty of disclosure ; patent - ability search ) ( Michel and Bettels 2001 ) . As for the difference between NPR - and SNPR - based indicators , it can be noted that the fraction of NPRs referring to the scientiﬁc literature ( journal articles and proceedings ) equals about 60 % of all NPR’s . This leads to considerable differences in derived indica - tors . The difference between NPR - and SNPR - based indicators is most prominent for the science extent indicator ( indicator 3 ) : the proportion of patents containing NPRs is 36 % when all NPRs are considered , and is reduced to 19 % when only scientiﬁc NPRs are considered . These observations are in line with what Guan and He ( 2007 ) found for their analyzed subset of Chinese USPTO patents : whereas 30 % of patents contained at least one 388 J .

The intensity - indicator measuring the number of references per citing patent ( indicator 4 ) is 4 . 5 and appears to be inde - pendent of whether all NPRs versus only scientiﬁc NPRs are considered ( except within the EPO subset ) . 2 The observed differences between NPR - and SNPR - based indicators signal the rele - vancy of singling out scientiﬁc NPRs when developing indicators of science – technology relatedness , based on references from patents to the non - patent literature . The difference is especially pronounced for indicators that reﬂect the extent of science in technology , i . e . the share of patents that contain references to the scientiﬁc literature . In the next section , we examine whether these observed differences display distinctive patterns across patent systems , technology ﬁelds and ( national ) innovation systems . Scientiﬁc extent and intensity : patterns of occurrence Many science – technology studies point out the importance of inﬂuencing factors when studying science – technology relations and related indicators ( for an overview : see Van Looy et al . 2002 ) . Patent system characteristics , national speciﬁcities and technological ﬁelds are among the most important factors . The USPTO and EPO systems differ considerably in terms of search and examination procedures . It has been argued that the comprehensiveness and the quality of citation lists appearing in patent documents vary signiﬁcantly as a function of the patent ofﬁce ( Meyer 2000b ; Michel and Bettels 2001 ) . At USPTO , patent applicants have a duty of disclosure , meaning that they must provide all information that is reasonably deemed necessary to properly examine the patent application and that they were aware of prior to the ﬁling date of the application . When ﬁling for a patent at EPO , applicants are under no such duty of disclosure . As Michel and Bettels ( 2001 ) point out , this leads to a situation where the average USPTO search report has the characteristics of a documentary search , whereas the EPO search reports reﬂect patentability searches . The patentability search is not exhaustive in the same sense as the documentary search in that it should be limited to what is directly relevant to patentability . As such , the volume of references in USPTO patents might be higher than the volume of references in EPO patents , as already conﬁrmed in our dataset of SNPR - based indicators ( cf . supra Table 2 ) . Moreover , the relations between science and technology and the indicators for mea - suring these might be inﬂuenced by differences in national innovation systems ( Harhoff et al . 2003 ; He and Deng 2007 ; Van Looy et al . 2002 ) . The scientiﬁc texture that char - acterizes a country might inﬂuence the occurrence of science interactions and hence translate into indicators based on the occurrence of references to the scientiﬁc literature . Finally , technology ﬁelds seem important to take into account . As the propensity to publish and the propensity to patent can vary considerably between disciplines and ﬁelds , citation patterns might differ within and between scientiﬁc and technology domains . Several studies have already pointed at ﬁeld speciﬁc effects regarding indicators that signal science – technology relatedness ( Callaert et al . 2006 ; Guan and He 2007 ; Harhoff et al . 2003 ; He and Deng 2007 ; Van Looy et al . 2002 , 2003 ; Verspagen 2008 ) . Patents from 2 This is because the denominators are adapted to the considered subset . Whereas the volume of patents with NPRs is used as the denominator for the NPR intensity , the volume of patents with scientiﬁc NPRs is used as a denominator for the SNPR intensity indicator . If , alternatively , the same denominator is used for both ( NPR and SNPR ) intensities—namely the total number of patents—then both intensities do differ signiﬁcantly . 390 J . Callaert et al . 123 technological ﬁelds that depend strongly on scientiﬁc progress ( e . g . pharmaceuticals , biotechnology , … ) are expected to display higher proportions and levels of scientiﬁc references . In order to examine to what extent these factors inﬂuence SNPR - based indicators , ANCOVA analyses ( analysis of co - variance ) were performed with scientiﬁc extent and intensity ( measured by considering only scientiﬁc NPRs ) acting as dependent variables . These variables have been logarithmically transformed to comply with normality assumptions . Independent variables included in the model are the applicant country , the technological domain and the patent system . To account for potential evolutions over time , a year covariate is included in the model . Interaction effects are included between applicant country and technological ﬁeld . The results are shown in Table 3 . Patent system , technology domain , and applicant country signiﬁcantly inﬂuence both the extent and the intensity of science within technology ; as measured by only using scientiﬁc NPRs . In addition , one observes a signiﬁcant interaction effect between tech - nology domain and country . Figure 1a , b clarify the inﬂuence of technological domains on scientiﬁc extent and intensity respectively . The ﬁgures distinguish between EPO and USPTO patents . Overall , the observations conﬁrm that the scientiﬁc footprint in technology is most outspoken for ﬁelds like Pharmaceuticals and Chemicals . At the lower end , one ﬁnds domains such as General machinery , Transport , Machine - tools , Energy machinery and Metal products . The technological speciﬁcity pattern of the scientiﬁc extent in technologies ( Fig . 1a ) is quite similar for EPO and USPTO patents , although EPO patents show less variety . Also in terms of scientiﬁc intensity of technologies ( Fig . 1b ) , the technological speciﬁcities are reﬂected more strongly in USPTO patents , with the science intensity of technology being most notable for pharmaceuticals . Figure 2a , b show the inﬂuence of applicant countries on scientiﬁc extent and intensity respectively . Only those countries are included with an annual average of at least 20 patents per technology domain . Again , the ﬁgures distinguish between USPTO and EPO patents .

For Japan , Austria and Korea , the scientiﬁc footprint is least apparent . Country - effects are at the same time shown to depend on which indicator is used . For instance , patents from Belgian applicants appear at the top in terms of extent of science in technology ( Fig . 2a ) , whereas Belgian patents display average levels in terms of scientiﬁc intensity ( Fig . 2b ) . The opposite holds for patents from Spanish applicants : although their scientiﬁc extent is average , it can be seen that for those Spanish patents that contain scientiﬁc references , the a b Fig . 1 a Inﬂuence of technological domains on the extent of science in technology . b Inﬂuence of technological domains on the intensity of science in technology 392 J . Callaert et al . 123 average number of references is high in comparison to other countries . Finally , the ﬁgures reveal that the inﬂuence of applicant countries on the scientiﬁc footprint in patents is much more outspoken for USPTO patents than for EPO patents . Inﬂuences on differences between NPR - and SNPR - based indicators : altered ranks We showed earlier that science - technology indicators differ , depending on whether only scientiﬁc NPRs or all NPRs are considered ( see Table 2 ) . Hence , reference - based indi - cators are sensitive to the speciﬁc subset of NPRs considered when calculating the indi - cators . The higher this sensitivity , the more appropriate it becomes to distinguish scientiﬁc from non - scientiﬁc NPRs . In this section , we investigate to what extent the difference between both types of indicators is inﬂuenced by the factors identiﬁed in the previous section : patent system , technology domain , and applicant country . ANCOVA analyses are again performed , with the ratios of SNPR - to NPR - based measures as dependent variables . Also these ratios were logarithmically transformed to comply with normality assumptions . The obtained ﬁndings are reported in Table 4 . The sensitivity of indicators to the considered subset of NPRs is shown to vary across patent systems , technological domains and applicant countries . Table 2 ( cf . supra ) already signaled that the proportion of patents containing SNPRs ( extent ) is about half the proportion of patents containing ( all types of ) NPRs . The dif - ference between USPTO and EPO in terms of extent is small in this respect albeit a b Fig . 2 a Inﬂuence of applicant countries on the extent of science in technology . b Inﬂuence of applicant countries on the intensity of science in technology Delineating the scientiﬁc footprint in technology 393 123 signiﬁcant ( ratios of 51 . 5 % vs . 52 . 4 % , overall ﬁgures ) . Similar observations apply for science intensity : while the ratio of both indicators is close to one for both EPO and USPTO , the difference turns out to be signiﬁcant for the countries and ﬁelds under study ( for USPTO patents , the intensity indicator shifts from 6 . 8 to 6 . 7 while for EPO , the intensity indicator shifts from 2 . 7 to 2 . 8 3 ) . As Table 4 reveals , more outspoken and signiﬁcant differences are observed with respect to countries and especially technology domains . The occurrence of these differ - ences has considerable implications in terms of use and accuracy of indicators . Indeed , the ranking of technology ﬁelds—both for scientiﬁc extent and intensity—is different , depending on which subset of NPRs is used for developing the indicator . This becomes clear when inspecting Table 5 . While the top 3 technology domains ( pharmaceuticals , chemicals and measurement ) are ranked consistently , one observes non - trivial shifts in ranks , depending on whether NPRs or SNPRs are considered . This is especially pronounced for the intensity indicator ( as witnessed also by the lower rank order correlation ) : the focus on only scientiﬁc references causes the domains of ‘telecommunications’ and ‘computers , ofﬁce machinery’ to drop 4 places in the ranking , whereas domains of ‘metal products’ and ‘special machinery’ rise 6 and 7 places respectively in terms of scientiﬁc intensity . Similar observations pertain to countries ( national innovation systems ) . Table 6 dem - onstrates the impact in terms of rankings . Only countries with an annual average of at least 20 patents per technology domain are included . Table 6 reveals considerable shifts , depending on whether NPRs or SNPRs are used to calculate indicators of science – technology relatedness . While these shifts are most out - spoken for the scientiﬁc extent indicator ( as reﬂected also in the lower rank order corre - lation ) , the resulting changes for the intensity indicator are in any case non - trivial .

This indi - cates the relevancy of distinguishing scientiﬁc references among NPRs if one is interested in assessing the presence and impact of scientiﬁc references in relation to technology development . While several scholars already signaled the ‘noisy’ character of NPR - based indicators , this paper is the ﬁrst to identify—in an exhaustive and accurate manner— scientiﬁc references among all NPRs by deploying text mining techniques and machine learning algorithms . Examining the occurrence of two reference - based indicators of science – technology relatedness ( the proportion of patents containing at least one ( scientiﬁc ) NPR : extent of scientiﬁc presence ; and the average number of ( scientiﬁc ) NPRs per ( cited ) patent : science intensity of the patent ) reveals contingencies in terms of patent system , technology domain and country ( national innovation system ) . In addition , these contingencies inﬂuence the actual ratio of SNPRs . These observations further corroborate the relevancy of delineating scientiﬁc references when constructing science – technology indicators based on NPRs .
