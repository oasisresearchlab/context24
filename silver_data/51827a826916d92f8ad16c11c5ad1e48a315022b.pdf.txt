Not all persons infected with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS - CoV ) develop severe symp - toms , which likely leads to an underestimation of the number of people infected and an overestimation of the severity . To estimate the number of MERS - CoV infections that have occurred in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia , we applied a statistical model to a line list describing 721 MERS - CoV infections detected between June 7 , 2012 , and July 25 , 2014 . We estimated that 1 , 528 ( 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) : 1 , 327 , 1 , 883 ) MERS - CoV infections occurred in this interval , which is 2 . 1 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 8 , 2 . 6 ) times the number reported . The probability of developing symptoms ranged from 11 % ( 95 % CI : 4 , 25 ) in persons under 10 years of age to 88 % ( 95 % CI : 72 , 97 ) in those 70 years of age or older . An estimated 22 % ( 95 % CI : 18 , 25 ) of those infected with MERS - CoV died . MERS - CoV is deadly , but this work shows that its clinical severity differs markedly between groups and that many cases likely go undiagnosed . burden ; clinical symptoms ; coronavirus ; MERS ; severity Abbreviations : CI , confidence interval ; KSA , Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ; MERS - CoV , Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus . Most infectious disease surveillance systems only capture a fraction of the infections that have actually occurred . The metaphor that is often used for this phenomenon is that of an iceberg : The visible tip consists mostly of those infections severe enough to cause an individual to seek medical care , but a potentially large number of often mild infections remain un - seen “ below the water . ” In the present study , we assessed the number of unrecognized mild or subclinical infections of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS - CoV ) that may have occurred in the Kingdom of Saudi Ara - bia ( KSA ) between June 2012 and July 2014 , particularly during the large outbreak that occurred in the country be - tween March and June of 2014 ( 1 , 2 ) . Determining the number of infections is important for un - derstanding the extent of the public health threat posed by MERS - CoV . Despite occasional incidences in other coun - tries , reported MERS - CoV infections have remained largely con ﬁ ned to the KSA ( 3 ) . Since MERS - CoV was ﬁ rst de - tected , the incidence has been generally low , but in the spring of 2014 , there was a large outbreak in the KSA , with 525 cases reported between March 1 and June 30 ( 1 , 2 ) . For the most part , surveillance fails to detect mild and subclinical in - fections . If undetected infections occur in large numbers , we may be signi ﬁ cantly overestimating how deadly MERS - CoV infection is . One approach to estimating the true number of persons in - fected with a disease is to estimate the probability of cases traversing each step on the pathway to detection ( 4 , 5 ) . If we know the probability that an infection will cause symptoms , the probability of a person seeking clinical care if symptoma - tic ( related to the severity ) , the probability of being correctly diagnosed after seeking care , the probability of an accurate 657 Am J Epidemiol . 2016 ; 183 ( 7 ) : 657 – 663 American Journal of Epidemiology © The Author 2016 .

However , as MERS - CoV is a newly emerged virus , we do not yet have good estimates of many of these probabilities . Hence , it is dif ﬁ cult to know what these probabilities are . Another possible approach to identifying the unmeasured burden of disease is to compare the frequencies of severe dis - ease and death in infections identi ﬁ ed through active surveil - lance with those identi ﬁ ed through passive surveillance ( 6 ) . Passive surveillance is done by testing patients who present to hospitals or health care clinics and meet the case de ﬁ nition for MERS - CoV infection ( 7 ) . Prior to a change in case de ﬁ - nition that took place on May 13 , 2014 , active surveillance included testing the contacts of known case patients and health care workers in facilities where MERS - CoV case pa - tients seek treatment , regardless of symptoms ( 8 , 9 ) . Case pa - tients identi ﬁ ed through active surveillance are more likely to have symptom pro ﬁ les and mortality rates similar to those of individuals of the same age and health status in the entire in - fected population than are those identi ﬁ ed through passive surveillance . This fact combined with the assumption that persons who die from MERS - CoV are nearly always detected through passive surveillance means that a comparison of cases detected through active surveillance and those detected through passive surveillance can give us insight into the total number of MERS - CoV infections that have occurred in the KSA and allow us to more accurately estimate the severity of MERS - CoV infection ( Figure 1 ) . In the present study , we used data on all laboratory - con ﬁ rmed cases of MERS - CoV in the KSA identi ﬁ ed by the Ministry of Health through active and passive surveillance as of July 25 , 2014 , to esti - mate the total number of subclinical cases that had occurred up to that point , the age - speci ﬁ c disease severity , and the true risk of death from infection . METHODS Data The KSA Ministry of Health assembled a line list of laboratory - con ﬁ rmed cases of MERS - CoV infection that oc - curred within the KSA from June 24 , 2012 , to July 25 , 2014 . This data set included information on age , sex , area of resi - dence , the reason the case patient was tested for MERS - CoV , whether the case patient had symptoms that met the case de ﬁ - nition suggestive of MERS - CoV at the time of testing , and the case patient ’ s most recently reported clinical status ( hospital - ized , home isolation , discharged , or deceased ) as of July 25 , 2014 . Line list data were abstracted from multiple sources , in - cluding MERS - CoV case report forms ( where available ) , lab - oratory report forms , and clinical records . Information on comorbid conditions was inconsistently available and therefore was not included in our analysis . We consider persons who had any indication of death , hospitalization , or MERS - CoV symp - tomsto have developed symptoms consistent with MERS - CoV infection severe enough to warrant testing at some point in their illness ( hereafter referred to as “ severe ” symptoms ) . In the present study , we considered laboratory - con ﬁ rmed cases of MERS - CoV in patients who were tested because of the presence of MERS - CoV symptoms as having been de - tected through passive surveillance and cases in patients who reported undergoing testing for other reasons ( e . g . , contact with a MERS - CoV case patient ) as having been detected through active surveillance . Within the KSA , active surveil - lance policies varied between locations and by time over the course of the period examined , and they were often poorly documented . Hence , there is no single protocol or set of cri - teria that led to individuals being tested for reasons other than having MERS - CoV symptoms . However , from mid - 2013 to 2014 , there was a general policy of testing home and hospital contacts of index case patients whether or not the contacts had symptoms ( 10 , 11 ) . Symptomatic infection ratio estimation We ﬁ t a probabilistic model to the observed distribution of symptoms and mortality in MERS - CoV infections detected through active and passive surveillance ( see Web Appendix , available at http : / / aje . oxfordjournals . org / ) . The rate at which individuals infected with MERS - CoV develop severe symp - toms and die is assumed to vary by age group . We assumed that infected individuals detected through active surveillance in each age class develop symptoms and die at the same rate Figure 1 . Estimating the unseen iceberg . In order to estimate the number of undetected Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infections , we assume that active surveillance detects cases irrespec - tive of their place on theiceberg andthat nearlyall deathsare detected ( denoted by the dashed box at right enclosing all parts of the iceberg ) . Passive surveillance , by contrast , detects cases above the waterline ( box at left above the waterline ) but not those below ( box at left below the waterline ) . That is , deaths , severe symptoms , and mild / asymptomatic infections occur in the same proportion in those identi - fied byactive surveillance asthey do in infections overall . We then use the proportionof personswith infections “ above thewaterline ” ( i . e . , ob - served through passive surveillance ) who die or develop symptoms severe enough to trigger Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavi - rus testing to infer the number of unseen infections . 658 Lessler et al . Am J Epidemiol . 2016 ; 183 ( 7 ) : 657 – 663 a t C o l u m b i a U n i v e r s it y L i b r a r i e s on A p r il 4 , 2016 h tt p : / / a j e . ox f o r d j ou r n a l s . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m as all ( i . e . , both detected and undetected ) individuals infected with MERS - CoV who are the same age ( Figure 1 ) . The prob - ability of being detected through passive surveillance is as - sumed to depend entirely on symptom status , and all cases of MERS - CoV in patients who die before being the infection is otherwise detected are assumed to have been detected by passive surveillance . Case patients without symptoms severe enough to trigger testing still have a small ( estimated ) prob - ability of their infections being detected by passive surveil - lance . The probability of a case being detected by active surveillance is assumed to be independent of symptom status . On the basis of the assumptions that all deceased case pa - tients would be detected and that symptom status and detec - tion through active surveillance were independent of each other , we derived the likelihood for the observed age - speci ﬁ c symptom distribution , mortality distribution , and incidence of actively and passively observed cases by week . For each age group , we estimated the symptomatic infection ratio , which is the rate at which MERS - CoV – infected individuals in that age group either develop symptoms suggestive of MERS - CoV infection or die . Combined with the estimated probabilities of detecting symptomatic and asymptomatic case patients through active and passive surveillance , this allowed us to es - timate the weekly incidence of MERS - CoV infection . All rates and probabilities were estimated using Bayesian Markov - chain Monte Carlo methods with the RStan package ( 12 ) . Four chains of 1 , 000 iterations each were run , with the last half of each chain used to determine estimates . Conver - gence was assessed using visual examination of chains and Gelman and Rubin ’ s ^ R statistic ( 13 ) . The model was validated using simulated data ( Web Table 1 ) . Sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine how sensitive the results were to temporal variations in reporting probabilities and the de ﬁ nition of active surveillance ( Web Tables 2 and 3 ) . Details of the model , validation , and sensitivity analyses are available in the Web Appendix . MERS - CoV mortality The case fatality ratio was calculated as the total number of deaths from MERS - CoV infection divided by the total num - ber of MERS - CoV case patients detected using the current surveillance system whose ﬁ nal case status was reported as either deceased or recovered from MERS - CoV . The infection fatality ratio for MERS - CoV was calculated as the number of deceased case patients divided by the total number of individ - uals infected with MERS - CoV , and it was estimated as part of the probabilistic model described above . Risk factors for MERS - CoV infection were analyzed using multivariate lo - gistic regression . RESULTS As of July 25 , 2014 , a total of 721 laboratory - con ﬁ rmed MERS - CoV infections had been identi ﬁ ed by the KSA Minis - try of Health . Of these , 70 % ( 504 of 721 ) were identi ﬁ ed through passive surveillance and 27 % ( 193 of 721 ) were iden - ti ﬁ ed through active surveillance ( i . e . , health care workers and contacts of con ﬁ rmed and probable case patients ) ; for 3 % ( 24 of 721 ) , the mode of detection was unknown . Thirty - three per - cent ( 63 of 193 ) of persons whose infections were detected through active surveillance died or were otherwise indicated to have developed symptoms consistent with the MERS - CoV case de ﬁ nition ( i . e . , would have eventually had the opportunity for their infection to be detected by active surveillance ) . Although the naïve case fatality ratio has decreased over the course of the epidemic ( from 75 % in 2012 to 40 % be - tween January and July 2014 ( Figure 2 ) ) , this difference was no longer signi ﬁ cant once we adjusted forage , health care worker status , and reason for testing . Age was a signi ﬁ cant risk factor for mortality , with health care workers ( adjusted odds ratio = 0 . 20 , 95 % con ﬁ dence interval ( CI ) : 0 . 11 , 0 . 38 ) and persons tested for reasons other than having MERS - CoV July 2012 Date of Onset N o . o f C a s e s Deceased Cases Living Cases Smoothed Case Fatality Ratio C a s e F a t a li t y R a t i o , % January 2013 July 2013 January 2014 July 2014 100 75 50 25 0 75 50 25 100 0 Figure 2 .

Though male sex was a signi ﬁ cant independent risk factor for mortality ( odds ratio = 1 . 89 , 95 % CI : 1 . 38 , 2 . 60 ) , it was no longer a signi ﬁ cant risk factor ( adjusted odds ratio = 1 . 15 , 95 % CI : 0 . 75 , 1 . 76 ) after adjustment for age , reason for testing , and health care worker status . We estimated a wide variation in the probability of infected individuals developing MERS - CoV symptoms by age , rang - ing from 11 % ( 95 % CI : 4 , 25 ) in persons who were 0 – 9 years old to 88 % ( 95 % CI : 72 , 97 ) in those 70 years of age or older ( Figure 3 ) . On the basis of these ratios , we estimated that , as of July 25 , 2014 , there were a total of 1 , 548 ( 95 % CI : 1 , 327 , 1 , 883 ) people infected with MERS - CoV ( Table 1 ) . Hence , reported cases likely comprised 47 % ( 95 % CI : 38 , 54 ) of the total number of MERS - CoV infections that had occurred in the KSA . We projected that nearly all ( 96 % ; 95 % CI : 77 , 100 ) of thoseinfected whodevelopMERS - CoVsymptoms consistent with the case de ﬁ nition were detected by MERS - CoV sur - veillance in the KSA . However , most asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infections were likely missed ; we estimated a 12 % ( 95 % CI : 10 , 15 ) probability of an infected individual being detected through active surveillance ( regardless of symptom status ) . As of July 25 , 2014 , a total of 691 persons with laboratory - con ﬁ rmed cases of MERS - CoV had been reported to the KSA Ministry of Health as having either recovered ( i . e . , been 0 . 00 0 . 50 0 . 75 0 – 9 50 – 59 10 – 19 40 – 49 Age , years P r opo r t i on Symptomatic Infection Ratio Infection Fatality Ratio Naïve Case Fatality Ratio 30 – 39 20 – 29 60 – 69 1 . 00 0 . 25 ≥ 70 Figure 3 .

Of these , 296 died , for naïve estimate of the case fatality ratio of 42 % . After correcting for under - reporting of asymptomatic individuals , the infection fatality ratio was estimated to be 22 % ( 95 % CI : 18 , 25 ) ( Table 1 ) , though it was 79 % ( 95 % CI : 70 , 86 , ( Figure 3 ) ) among those 70 years of age or older . Several sensitivity analyses and validation exercises were performed to assess model performance ( see Web Appen - dix ) . We were able to accurately estimate true detection rates under a variety of simulated scenarios , with 95 % con ﬁ dence intervals covering the true number of cases in all but one in - stance , in which the detection probability was low and death rates by age followed no functional form . Estimates of total number of infections ( and hence the infection fatality ratio ) were robust to allowing variations in reporting rates over the course of the epidemic . DISCUSSION We estimated that as of July 25 , 2014 , there were 1 , 528 ( 95 % CI : 1 , 327 , 1 , 883 ) MERS - CoV infections in KSA , ap - proximately twice as many as had been observed . Nearly all persons with undetected infections were predicted to not have developed symptoms of MERS - CoV severe enough to trig - ger testing , but they may have developed mild symptoms or have had a severe but unusual clinical presentation . Although MERS - CoV is always potentially deadly ( we es - timate the infection fatality ratio to be more than 5 % in all age groups ) , the greatest risk is in individuals older than 60 years of age ; persons in that age group have a higher than 60 % chance of dying if infected . This pattern is similar to that seen for other respiratory viruses ( e . g . , in ﬂ uenza ) ( 14 ) , although the associa - tion is more extreme and likely results from increasing frailty and the prevalence of comorbid conditions ( 15 ) . Unfortu - nately , clinical data on comorbid conditions were not generally available in the data set we analyzed . The infectivity of subclinical MERS - CoV cases is un - known . The apparent rarity of MERS - CoV transmission ex - cept in health care settings suggests that the infectivity of such cases is low ( 16 , 17 ) . However , low - level infectivity of subclinical infections may help explain the occasional ap - pearance of MERS - CoV infection in persons with no known human exposures or reported animal contact . Ours is not the only analysis of MER - CoV infection in which investigators have examined the frequency with which infections go undetected , case patients are asymptom - atic , or case patients die . In an early study of household trans - mission , Drosten et al . ( 18 ) identi ﬁ ed 12 household contacts with serologic or virologic evidence of MERS - CoV infection , none of whom developed symptoms . In a cross - sectional se - rosurvey , 15 of 10 , 009 sera collected in 2012 and 2013 from healthy individuals tested positive for anti – MERS - CoV anti - bodies , a rate that , if applied to the whole of the KSA , would imply far more cases than estimated here ( see below ) ( 19 ) . In their analysis , Cauchemez et al . ( 20 ) used entirely different methods to estimate that at least 62 % of symptomatic human case patients were going undetected as of 2013 , a slightly higher rate than estimated here . In that paper ( 20 ) and a de - tailed investigation of the South Korean outbreak that re - sulted from a single imported case caused by exposure in the Middle East ( 21 ) , fatality rates ( 20 % and 21 % , respec - tively ) among secondary cases that were similar to the overall infection fatality rate estimated here were reported . There are several limitations that could bias the results of the present study . The full histories of symptoms over the course of infection were not available , and some case patients who were initially reported as asymptomatic or as having mild symptoms might have developed symptoms that were not captured in our data at some point . However , because our estimates were also based on mortality data , the effect of this mischaracterization should be mitigated . Active sur - veillance may be more likely to detect case patients infected by known contacts with other infected persons than those infected by dromedary camels . If individuals infected by hu - mans and those infected by camels develop severe symptoms and enter the passive surveillance system at the same rate , this should not bias our estimates ; however , it is possible that the route of infection does impact the probability of symptoms ( particularly camel - to - human infection that occurs through a route other than the respiratory system ) . In our analysis , we did not take reporting delays into ac - count ; however , because no cases were reported between July 3 and July 25 , 2015 , doing so would have had little im - pact on our results . Under - reporting of deaths cannot be ruled out , nor can a bias towards reporting more severe cases ; both would bias our estimates . We cannot be sure that the mortal - ity rate and symptomatic rate in case patients tested for reasons other than MERS - CoV symptoms are the same as those of in - fections in general . We further assume 100 % sensitivity in lab - oratory testing , but the true sensitivity may be less and vary over the course of a case patient ’ s illness . We assume that ac - tive case ﬁ nding is independent of the development of symp - toms , but it is likely that persons with some symptoms are more likely to be tested than are other contacts of or health care workers who dealt with MERS - CoV – infected patients , particularly after protocol changes in April and May of 2014 ( 8 , 9 ) . Likewise , asymptomatically infected individuals may shed less virus and thus be less likely to test positive for MERS - CoV infection . These biases would lead to an underes - timation of the true number of MERS - CoV infections in our model , so our estimated number of total infections is conserva - tive ( e . g . , if persons with cases detected by active surveillance have twice the odds of developing symptoms or dying com - pared with cases overall , the true number of MERS - CoV in - fections would be 1 . 3 times our estimate ; see Web Table 3 ) . The estimates of the true number of MERS - CoV cases from our analysis are far fewer than other authors projected based on serological evidence ( 19 ) . As discussed above , our method has limitations that tend to bias estimates of the true number of cases downward ; serosurveys in general , and those by Müller et al . ( 19 ) in particular , have their own sets of lim - itations that may bias estimates upward . In particular , 1 ) cross - sectional serosurveys do not de ﬁ ne a risk period and will pick up exposures that occurred before the current epidemic ; 2 ) se - rological tests have limited ability to distinguish MERS - CoV from other recent and historic coronaviruses ( camel and other - wise ) that may be antigenically similar but not cause severe disease in humans ; and 3 ) projections of a low attack rate to the entire population of the KSA may be problematic ( as ac - knowledged by the authors ) . Given the differing direction of Severity and Subclinical Burden of MERS - CoV 661 Am J Epidemiol . 2016 ; 183 ( 7 ) : 657 – 663 a t C o l u m b i a U n i v e r s it y L i b r a r i e s on A p r il 4 , 2016 h tt p : / / a j e . ox f o r d j ou r n a l s . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m potential biases in serological and case - based approaches , the truth may like somewhere in between the 2 approaches . If truly accurate estimates are desired in the future , serological and ac - tive surveillance methods must be implemented with this in mind from the start of the response to an emerging infection , providing the appropriate baselines and consistency in proce - dure that are needed to have early , precise , and unbiased esti - mates of the true burden of a disease . Such planning would increase the power of the approach taken here and lead to con - sistent estimates between approaches . Data that are typically available from active case ﬁ nding and passive surveillance are common in the investigation of emerging infectious diseases . The methods used here to esti - mate the true number of MERS - CoV infections could be ap - plied to any disease in which this combination of data is available . Given the diverse assortment of ﬁ rst - line health care providers and local health systems involved in outbreak response and the enormous workload typically associated with the response , a key challenge is to collect the relevant data in a coordinated and standardized way from the early stages of the outbreak . This aspect of the response may be im - proved by numerous efforts to develop generic protocols for outbreak response prepared in advance ( 22 , 23 ) . In particular , it would be useful to have a clear record of the reasons for a case patient ’ s entry into the line list to facilitate analysis such as that presented here . Although the at least 53 % of MERS - CoV cases that our analysis suggested would be unobserved is not quite the 90 % implied by the iceberg metaphor , the observed cases are only a fraction of the number of MERS - CoV infections ob - served . As is common when dealing with emerging diseases , our data on MERS - CoV are imperfect , and we must make as - sumptions to produce meaningful estimates of the true number of cases . If wrong , these assumptions generally bias the esti - mated number of infections down ; thus , our estimate may be best viewed as a lower limit of the true number of MERS - CoV infections in the KSA . However , even the number of unde - tected infections projected by our work represents a sizeable population of individuals who were infected with the virus within the KSA but whose infections were not detected . More re ﬁ ned estimates will require serological surveys or mod - i ﬁ cations to the surveillance system with the speci ﬁ c aim of improving detection of asymptomatic cases .
