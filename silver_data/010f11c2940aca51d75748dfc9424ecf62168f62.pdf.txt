Cortactin : coupling membrane dynamics to cortical actin assembly Scott A Weed * , 1 and J Thomas Parsons 2 1 Department of Craniofacial Biology , University of Colorado Health Sciences Center , Denver , Colorado , CO 80262 , USA ; 2 Department of Microbiology , Health Sciences Center , University of Virginia , Charlottesville , Virginia , VA 22903 , USA Exposure of cells to a variety of external signals causes rapid changes in plasma membrane morphology . Plasma membrane dynamics , including membrane ru(cid:130)e and microspike formation , fusion or ﬁssion of intracellular vesicles , and the spatial organization of transmembrane proteins , is directly controlled by the dynamic reorgani - zation of the underlying actin cytoskeleton . Two members of the Rho family of small GTPases , Cdc42 and Rac , have been well established as mediators of extracellular signaling events that impact cortical actin organization . Actin - based signaling through Cdc42 and Rac ultimately results in activation of the actin - related protein ( Arp ) 2 / 3 complex , which promotes the forma - tion of branched actin networks . In addition , the activity of both receptor and non - receptor protein tyrosine kinases along with numerous actin binding proteins works in concert with Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymer - ization in regulating the formation of dynamic cortical actin - associated structures . In this review we discuss the structure and role of the cortical actin binding protein cortactin in Rho GTPase and tyrosine kinase signaling events , with the emphasis on the roles cortactin plays in tyrosine phosphorylation - based signal transduction , reg - ulating cortical actin assembly , transmembrane receptor organization and membrane dynamics . We also consider how aberrant regulation of cortactin levels contributes to tumor cell invasion and metastasis . Oncogene ( 2001 ) 20 , 6418 – 6434 . Keywords : Rho GTPase ; actin cytoskeleton ; tyrosine kinase substrate ; Arp2 / 3 complex ; vesicle tra(cid:129)cking ; invasion Introduction Dynamic changes in the cortical actin cytoskeleton are central to a wide variety of cellular events , including cell motility , adhesion , endo - and phagocytosis , cytokinesis , movement of intracellular particles through the cytoplasm and organization of transmem - brane proteins ( Mitchison and Cramer , 1996 ; Ridley , 2000 ; Qualmann et al . , 2000 ; Chimini and Chavrier , 2000 ; Mandato et al . , 2000 ; Beckerle , 1998 ; Wheal et al . , 1998 ) . The actin cytoskeleton at the cell periphery consists of a highly organized meshwork of ﬁlamentous ( F - ) actin closely associated with the overlying plasma membrane ( Small et al . , 1995 ) . In motile cells , F - actin underlies two main types of protrusive membranes ; lamellipodia , which contain short ﬁlaments of F - actin linked into orthogonal arrays and ﬁlopodia , comprised of bundled , crosslinked actin ﬁlaments ( Rinnerthaler et al . , 1988 ) . Work within the last decade has demon - strated that Rac and Cdc42 , two members of the Rho family of small GTPases , govern lamellipodia and ﬁlopodia formation ( Hall , 1998 ) . Cdc42 and Rac play a pivotal role in the transmission of extracellular signals that induce cortical cytoskeletal rearrangement ( Zig - mond , 1996 ) , eliciting their e(cid:128)ects through a large number of binding ( or ‘e(cid:128)ector’ ) proteins ( Aspenstrom , 1999 ; Bishop and Hall , 2000 ) . It is now well established that members of the Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASp ) family serve as the e(cid:128)ector proteins for Cdc42 and Rac - mediated cortical actin polymeriza - tion by directly binding to and activating the actin nucleation activity of the actin related protein ( Arp ) 2 / 3 complex ( Higgs and Pollard , 1999 ) . Arp2 / 3 complex activity is essential for the protrusion of the leading edge during cell migration ( Borisy and Svitkina , 2000 ; Pollard et al . , 2000 ) . Activation of Cdc42 and Rac are also closely coordinated with tyrosine kinase signaling pathways . In the case of receptor tyrosine kinases such as the EGFR or PDGFR , ligand binding resulting in cortical actin rearrangements responsible for membrane ru(cid:130)ing and motility are mediated by downstream activation Cdc42 and Rac ( Liu and Burridge , 2000 ) . EGFR and PDGFR activation also result in activation of cellular Src ( c - Src , or Src ) family nonreceptor tyrosine kinases ( Parsons and Parsons , 1997 ) . The activity of Src and related kinases are responsible for the tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous actin - binding proteins that impact cortical actin cytoskeleton organization and cell shape ( Brown and Cooper , 1996 ; Kellie et al . , 1991 ) . This is highlighted in cells expressing oncogenic forms of Src , which causes dramatic alterations in the actin cytoskeleton resulting in aberrant cell adhesion and morphology ( Jove and Hanafusa , 1987 ) . While Cdc42 , Rac and Src are all activated during integrin - mediated cell adhesion , divergent pathways are utilized in regulating GTPase and Src activity , suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoskeletal Src substrates can occur independently of Cdc42 and Rac activation ( Clark et al . , 1998 ) .

It is now clear that proteins involved in both Rho family GTPase and tyrosine kinase signaling pathways play important cooperative and integrative roles in cortical actin cytoskeletal signaling ( Zigmond , 1996 ; Parsons , 1996 ) . In this review we will consider the structure and role of the Src substrate and cortical actin - associated protein cortactin , with empha - sis on signaling pathways involved in cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation as well as the role of cortactin in dynamic membrane events involving Arp2 / 3 - mediated cortical actin reorganization . Structural organization of cortactin and related proteins Cortactin was initially identiﬁed as a tyrosine phos - phorylated protein in v - Src infected chicken embryo ﬁbroblasts ( Kanner et al . , 1990 ) . Subsequent cloning of the cDNA encoding cortactin revealed a novel protein with a unique domain structure ( Wu et al . , 1991 ) . Structural predictions based on the amino acid sequence indicate that cortactin is comprised of several domains ( Figure 1 ) . The ﬁrst 84 – 94 amino - terminal residues are largely unstructured , containing a large number of acidic residues between amino acids 15 and 35 and is referred to as the amino terminal acidic domain ( NTA ; Weed et al . , 2000 ) . The NTA region is followed by a series of six complete 37 amino acid tandemly repeating segments and one incomplete segment 20 residues in length . The complete repeats are predicted to form a helix - turn - helix structure ( Wu et al . , 1991 ) and have been termed cortactin repeats ( Sparks et al . , 1996a ) since they show no sequence similarity to other known repeats except in HS1 ( see below ) . The repeats region is followed by a a - helical domain 48 – 52 amino acids in length , a proline - rich domain of variable length abundant in tyrosine , serine and threonine residues , and a Src homology ( SH ) 3 domain at the distal carboxyl terminus . The cortactin SH3 domain shares signiﬁcant homology to SH3 domains from Src - family kinases , various adapter and cytoskeletal proteins ( Wu et al . , 1991 ; Sparks et al . , 1996a ) . Cortactin genes have now been cloned from a number of diverse organisms . In addition to chicken , complete cDNA sequences have been reported for human ( Schuuring et al . , 1993 ) , rat ( Ohoka and Takai , 1998 ) , mouse ( Zhan et al . , 1993 ; Miglarese et al . , 1994 ) , Drosophila ( Katsube et al . , 1998 ) and the sea urchin Strongylocentrouts purpuratus ( Genebank accession # AF064260 ) . All cortactins are structurally similar to each other , with the SH3 domain showing the greatest amount of evolutionary conservation while the proline - rich domain the least ( Figure 1 ) . With the exception of the proline - rich domain , vertebrate cortactins show a particularly strong similarity , demonstrating greater than 87 % identity in all other domains . Invertebrate cortactins show a similar pattern , with the SH3 domain at least 71 % identical while the proline - rich regions are less than 20 % homologous to the mouse form . The large degree of conservation in the SH3 domain suggests that this domain binds ligands conserved across a broad evolutionary spectrum , performing a similar function ( s ) in diverse species . The proline - rich segments in invertebrate cortactins are considerably longer than the similar regions in the vertebrate proteins , accounting in part for the low degree of homology ( Katsube et al . , 1998 ) . Only one cortactin gene has been identiﬁed to date , and in most cell types is responsible for a single cortactin protein product that often migrates as two separate bands in SDS – PAGE with relative molecular weights of 80 and 85 kDa ( Wu et al . , 1991 ) . This is considerably larger than the predicted 61 – 63 kDa molecular mass based on the primary sequence ( Wu et al . , 1991 ; Miglarese et al . , 1994 ) and is presumably due to the proline - rich domain in the carboxyl terminus . The two observed cortactin bands likely represent di(cid:128)erent conformational states , since both forms are observed following expression of recombi - nant cortactin constructs in eukaryotic and prokaroytic systems ( Wu et al . , 1991 ; Huang et al . , 1997 ) . This is further supported by the observation of a single cortactin band following denaturing SDS – PAGE in 5 M urea ( Huang et al . , 1997 ) . However , cortactin isoforms have been recently identiﬁed in rat brain that are products of alternative mRNA splicing ( Ohoka and Takai , 1998 ) . These shorter forms result from the Figure 1 Structure of cortactin and comparison with related proteins . Domain organization of murine cortactin ( top ) , HS1 ( middle ) and Abp1 ( bottom ) .

Currently it is not clear if alternative spliced forms of cortactin are present in other tissues . Northern blot analysis indicates that cortactin is expressed in nearly all mammalian tissues ( Miglarese et al . , 1994 ; Du et al . , 1998 ) . One notable exception is in hematopoietic cells , where the related protein HS1 is expressed in place of cortactin ( Kitamura et al . , 1989 ) . HS1 is structurally related to cortactin , with the NTA , cortactin repeats and SH3 domain showing the greatest homology . HS1 di(cid:128)ers from cortactin in that it contains only three complete cortactin repeats ( Figure 1 ) , and that the helical and proline - rich domains are inverted with respect to cortactin ( Kitamura et al . , 1995 ) . In spite of these di(cid:128)erences , HS1 shares functional similarities with cortactin , serving as a Src - family tyrosine kinase substrate ( Takemoto et al . , 1995 ; Brunati et al . , 1999 ) as well as playing a unique and essential role in antigen - receptor induced B cell clonal expansion ( Taniuchi et al . , 1995 ) . Another protein that structurally resembles cortactin is murine actin - binding protein 1 ( mAbp ; Kessels et al . , 2000 ) . The carboxyl terminus of mAbp1 contains a helical , proline - rich and SH3 domain that shares moderate sequence similarity with the cognate domains in cortactin ( Figure 1 ) . While mAbp1 does not contain a NTA domain or cortactin repeats , the amino terminus contains an actin depolymerizing factor homology ( ADF - H ) domain , an actin - binding domain found in a number of cytoskeletal proteins ( Lappalai - nen et al . , 1998 ) . mAbp1 and cortactin appear to be functionally similar in many respects ( see below ) . Cortactin as a target for tyrosine and serine / threonine protein kinases Following the observation that cortactin is tyrosine phosphorylated in cells transformed by v - Src , a wealth of data have indicated that cortactin tyrosine phos - phorylation is closely correlated with Src activity in a number of signaling pathways ( Table 1 ) . Src kinase activity is downregulated following phosphorylation of a carboxyl - terminal tyrosine ( codon 527 in chicken ) by C - terminal Src Kinase ( Csk ) , which creates an intramolecular binding site for the Src SH2 domain that in turn holds the kinase in a conformationally inactive state ( Nada et al . , 1991 ) . While cells from Csk 7 / 7 mouse embryos display elevated kinase activity of the Src family members Src , Fyn and Lyn ( Imamoto and Soriano , 1993 ; Nada et al . , 1993 ) , studies in Src 7 / 7 Csk 7 / 7 and Fyn 7 / 7 Csk 7 / 7 ﬁbroblasts indicate that Src is primarily responsible for cortactin tyrosine phos - phorylation resulting from Csk knockout ( Thomas et al . , 1995 ) . In accordance with these studies , it is now clear that activation of Src in response to diverse cell stimuli points to a direct physiological role for Src - mediated cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation . Contin - uous stimulation of quiescent ﬁbroblasts with FGF - 1 ( b FGF ) or EGF leads to a rapid induction of cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation ( within 5 min ) that decreases within 1 h , increases again within 4 – 7 h and is sustained for 12 – 24 h ( Maa et al . , 1992 ; Zhan et al . , 1993 ) . While the signiﬁcance of the biphasic nature of cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation under these condi - tions is not clear , overexpression of Src enhances EGF - induced cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation ( Maa et al . , 1992 ) while activation of Src and coimmunoprecipita - tion with cortactin is achieved following FGF - 1 treatment ( Zhan et al . , 1994 ) . These studies support a role for Src in growth factor - induced cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation . In addition , Src has been implicated as the kinase responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in cell - matrix and cell - cell adhesion events . In NIH3T3 ﬁbroblasts , a 5 b 1 integrin - mediated cell adhesion and spreading on ﬁbronectin results in elevated cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation ( Vuori and Ruoslahti , 1995 ) , a condition where Src is activated following binding to activated focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) ( Schaller et al . , 1994 ) . In N18 neuro - blastoma cells , cortactin is tyrosine phosphorylated following binding of N - syndecan ( syndecan 3 ) with heparin - binding growth - associated molecule ( HB - GAM ) , and both cortactin and Src copurify following a(cid:129)nity chromotography using the N - syndecan cyto - plasmic domain ( Kinnunen et al . , 1998 ) . Similarly , binding of CD44 to hyaluronic acid ( HA ) in ovarian tumor cells leads to activation and association of Src with the CD44 cytoplasmic domain and subsequent cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation ( Bourguignon et al . , 2001 ) . Engagement of a v b 3 integrin with soluble vitronectin , binding of ICAM - 1 to a L b 2 or a 4 b 1 integrin , as well as peroxide - mediated injury in endothelial cells also induces Src activation and subsequent cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation ( Dur - ieu - Trautmann et al . , 1994 ; Bhattacharya et al . , 1995 ; Li et al . , 2000 ) . Finally , invasion of epithelial cells by either Shigella ﬂexneri ( Dehio et al . , 1995 ) or Chlamydia trachomatis ( Fawaz et al . , 1997 ) leads to increased cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation , and in the case of Shigella , Src overexpression enhances cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation upon bacteria entry . Collectively , the strong correlation between Src activa - tion and cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation in these studies suggest that cortactin is phosphorylated directly by Src ( Table 1 ) . Coimmunoprecipitation of Src with cortactin sug - gests that Src directly binds cortactin ( Zhan et al . , 1994 ; Okamura and Resh , 1995 ; van Damme et al . , 1997 ) . In support of this , cortactin directly interacts with the recombinant SH2 domain of Src and other SH2 domain - containing proteins , an interaction that is prevented in the presence of a phosphopeptide contain - ing the optimal Src SH2 binding sequence ( - pYEEI - ; Songyang et al . , 1993 ; Okamura and Resh , 1995 ) . These results indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin creates phospho - dependent binding site ( s ) for Src and perhaps other SH2 domain - containing pro - teins . Src directly phosphorylates cortactin in vitro Cortactin and membrane dynamics SA Weed and JT Parsons 6420 Oncogene ( Huang et al . , 1997 ) on three tyrosine residues in murine cortactin ( tyrosine - 421 , tyrosine - 466 and tyr - osine - 482 ) located within the proline - rich domain ( Huang et al . , 1998 ) ( Figure 2a ) . Expression of a cortactin construct where tyrosines 421 , 466 and 482 were mutated to phenylalanine dramatically reduced cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation following expres - sion in v - Src transformed 3T3 ﬁbroblasts , indicating that these residues are targeted by Src in vivo ( Huang et al . , 1998 ) . Although the sequential order by which Src phosphorylates cortactin is unknown , the presence of a consensus Src SH2 binding sequence next to tyrosine 421 ( Figure 2c ) raises the possibility that this residue may be initially phosphorylated by Src , thereby allowing for the stabilization of Src with cortactin through an interaction between the Src SH2 domain and phosphorylated tyrosine 421 . Stabilization of Src at tyrosine 421 may act to further facilitate the phosphorylation of cortactin at tyrosines 466 and 482 . Evidence for the importance of Src SH2 domain binding in cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation is high - lighted by the marked reduction of tyrosine phosphor - ylation of cortactin in Csk 7 / 7 cells treated with Src SH2 inhibitory compounds ( Violette et al . , 2001 ) . While phosphorylation of cortactin by Src appears to be functionally linked to some aspects of actin organization and cell motility , the full signiﬁcance of Src mediated cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation is not yet understood . A second nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that is involved in growth factor - mediated cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation is Fer . Fer , along with Fps / Fes , comprise a small and distinct tyrosine kinase subfamily that is has unique structural characteristics , including the presence of an amino terminal coiled - coil sequence proximal to a central SH2 domain and a carboxyl terminal catalytic domain ( Hao et al . , 1989 ) . NIH3T3 cells treated with PDGF leads to Fer activation and cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation ( Downing and Reynolds , 1991 ; Kim and Wong , 1998 ) which is markedly reduced in ﬁbroblasts derived from Fer 7 / 7 mice ( Craig et al . , 2001 ) . Fer immunoprecipitates with cortactin , and the Fer SH2 domain interacts with cortactin in cell extracts , suggesting that Fer directly interacts with and phosphorylates cortactin . This is further supported by the suppression of CSF - 1 receptor - mediated cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation by expression of kinase deﬁcient Fer ( Kim and Wong , 1998 ) . Other evidence supporting a role for Fer in cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation has come from the analysis of signaling events involved in cell shrinkage . Hyperosmolarity elevates tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin as well as the activity of the Fyn , while suppressing Src activity ( Kapus et al . , 1999 ) . The requirement for Fyn in this process is further underscored by the reduction of cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation in hyperosmotic Fyn 7 / 7 , but not Src 7 / 7 cells ( Kapus et al . , 1999 ) . A rapid reduction in cell volume also activates Fer , which is suppressed by pretreatment with the Src family inhibitor PP1 as well as in Fyn 7 / 7 cells ( Kapus et al . , 2000 ) . Expression of kinase deﬁcient Fer also inhibits osmotic - induced cortactin tyrosine phos - phorylation , and hyperosmotic conditions fail to signiﬁcantly increase the tyrosine phosphorylation level Table 1 Cellular conditions that promote cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation Type of stimulis Cell type Implicated kinase Comments Reference Growth factors FGF - 1 fibroblast Src Zhan et al .

Collectively these data indicate that osmotic - induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin by Fer requires upstream activity of Fyn , and that Fer directly phosphorylates one or more of the same tyrosine residues targeted by Src . The functional signiﬁcance of Fer - mediated cortactin tyrosine phos - phorylation is unclear . It is also not known if Fer is responsible for the Fyn - mediated increase in cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation observed during calcium - induced keratinocyte di(cid:128)erentiation ( Calautti et al . , 1995 ) . Cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation is also observed during platelet di(cid:128)erentiation and activation . Although Src activation and cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation are coincident with thrombin - mediated platelet activa - tion following binding to a IIB b 3 integrin ( Fox et al . , 1993 ) , there is also evidence that the hematopoietic - specﬁc kinase Syk plays an important role in cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation during platelet maturation and activation . Syk is homologous to the lymphocyte - Figure 2 Diagrammatic representation of cortactin - interacting proteins and sequence alignments of known and putative interaction sites . ( a ) Mapping of cortactin binding proteins and phosphorylation sites . Binding of Arp2 / 3 complex occurs through the three amino acid – DDW - motif within the NTA domain . The actin - binding domain is located within the repeats region , requiring the fourth repeat and possibly adjacent sequences . Tyrosine phosphorylation by Src and Fer occurs within the proline - rich domain at Y421 , Y466 and Y482 , creating putative binding sites for SH2 domains . Putative serine phosphorylation by ERK1 / 2 occurs at S405 and S418 . The SH3 domain interacts with numerous PDZ - containing sca(cid:128)olding proteins as well with dynamin and CBP90 .

( 1999 ) ( mXin ) , Takahisa et al . ( 1996 ) ( ZO - 1 ) , Ohoka and Takai ( 1998 ) ( CBP90 ) , and Cook et al . ( 1994 ) ( Dynamin ) Cortactin and membrane dynamics SA Weed and JT Parsons 6422 Oncogene speciﬁc ZAP - 70 kinase , containing two amino - terminal SH2 domains and a carboxyl - terminal catalytic domain ( Chan et al . , 1992 ; Muller et al . , 1994 ) . Syk is activated following ﬁbrinogen ligation to a IIB b 3 integrin , and requires the intact cytoplasmic domains of both integrin subunits ( Gao et al . , 1997 ) . Defects in a IIB b 3 integrin are found in individuals with Glanzmann thrombasthenia , which experience excessive bleeding due to defective platelet activation and aggregation ( Nurden and Caen , 1974 ) . Platelets from Glanzmann patients display reduced cortactin tyrosine phosphor - ylation following ﬁbrinogen stimulation ( Rosa et al . , 1997 ) indicating that a IIB b 3 integrin - induced activation of Syk is required for cortactin tyrosine phosphoryla - tion . Syk autophosphorylation is inhibited in the presence of catalytic inactive Src , indicating that Src activity is required for Syk activation and subsequent cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation in a manner analogous to that of the Fyn / Fer pathway described above . In addition , integrin - independent cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation attributable to Syk activation occurs following treatment of platelets with thrombox - ane analogues and in TPA - induced megakaryocyte di(cid:128)erentiation of K562 leukemic cells ( Maruyama et al . , 1996 ; Gallet et al . , 1999 ) . TPA treatment of K562 cells leads to Src activation in the presence of kinase inactive Syk , further suggesting that Src acts upstream of Syk ( Maruyama et al . , 1996 ) . Furthermore , thromboxane stimulation of platelets does not elevate Src kinase activity , indicating that Syk can act independent of Src in phosphorylating cortactin ( Gallet et al . , 1999 ) . In these cases , cortactin forms complexes with Syk prior to simulus addition , suggesting that the interaction between Syk and cortactin is phosphotyr - osine independent . Although the role of Syk - induced cortactin phosphorylation is not known , it likely plays an important role in regulating platelet morphology ( Gallet et al . , 1999 ) . In addition to serving as a tyrosine kinase substrate , cortactin is also phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues ( Wu et al . , 1991 ) . Serine and threonine phosphorylation of cortactin is enhanced in human squamous carcinoma cell lines following stimulation with EGF , causing a shift from the 80 to the 85 kDa cortactin form ( van Damme et al . , 1997 ) . Treatment of 293 cells with EGF leads to a similar shift that is blocked by the MEK inhibitor PD98059 , indicating that EGF - induced activation of the Ras - Raf - MEK - ERK pathway is responsible for cortactin serine and threonine phosphorylation ( Campbell et al . , 1999 ) . Based on peptide mapping data , ERK1 / 2 has been proposed to phosphorylate cortactin at two ERK consensus sites , serine - 405 ( - 403PV S P ) and serine - 418 ( - 416PS S P ) within the proline - rich domain ( Campbell et al . , 1999 ) . MEK activates a number of serine / threonine kinases other than ERKs , which may in part contribute to additional cortactin phosphorylation events ( Kolch , 2000 ) . Since serine 405 and 418 lie within putative SH3 binding sites , and although these sequences do not conform to known cortactin SH3 domain - binding sequences ( Figure 2d ) , it has been proposed that ERK - mediated serine phosphorylation may regulate an intramolecular interaction between the cortactin SH3 domain and sequences within the proline - rich domain . This would render cortactin in an ‘open’ conformation , allowing binding of the SH3 domain to other ligands ( Campbell et al . , 1999 ) . This model has been proposed for other proteins ( Taylor et al . , 1998 ) , and is indirectly supported by the presence of a single 85 kDa band expressed from a cortactin construct containing a disruptive point mutation within the SH3 domain ( Du et al . , 1998 ) . Alternatively , serine / threonine phosphorylation of cortactin within the proline - rich domain may regulate SH3 - mediated bind - ing of heterologous proteins , as has been demonstrated for Sos and FAK ( Corbalan - Garcia et al . , 1996 ; Ma et al . , 2001 ) . The role of cortactin in cortical actin organization Localization and biochemical studies point to cortactin playing an important role in regulating cortical actin assembly and organization . In most cell types cortactin localizes in cytoplasmic punctate structures of un - known composition concentrated at the perinuclear region , and also with F - actin at sites of dynamic peripherial membrane activity ( Figure 3a , b ) . Cortactin translocates from the cytoplasm to the periphery in response to many of the same stimuli that induce its tyrosine phosphorylation , including growth factor treatment , integrin activation and bacterial entry ( Ozawa et al . , 1995 ; Weed et al . , 1998 ; Cantarelli et al . , 2000 ) . These events also lead to activation of Rac ( Hartwig et al . , 1995 ; Clark et al . , 1998 ; Mounier et al . , 1999 ) , which together with Cdc42 are responsible for controlling the formation of cortical actin networks ( Ridley et al . , 1992 ; Kozma et al . , 1995 ) . Rac activation is required for cortactin translocation to the cell periphery ( Weed et al . , 1998 ) , and cortactin disperses from cortical actin networks following treatment with the F - actin disrupting drug cytochalasin D ( Wu and Parsons , 1993 ) . Cortical localization of cortactin is therefore closely associated with Rac - mediated actin assembly . In agreement with its localization to the cortical actin network , cortactin interacts directly with F - actin ﬁlaments through sequences in the repeats domain ( Wu and Parsons , 1993 ) . Deletion mapping analysis has determined that the fourth cortactin repeat is respon - sible for F - actin binding and cortical localization ( Weed et al . , 2000 ) . Cortactins - A , - B and - C all bind F - actin ( Ohoka and Takai , 1998 ) whereas the ﬁrst three cortactin repeats do not ( He et al . , 1998 ) , conﬁrming the importance of the fourth cortactin repeat in F - actin binding . Cortactin binds to the sides of actin ﬁlaments as determined by negative stained electron microscopy of recombinant cortactin / F - actin mixtures ( H Wu and JT Parsons , unpublished observa - tions ) and by competition binding experiments with myosin subfragment 1 ( Ohoka and Takai , 1998 ) . HS1 also binds actin through the amino - terminal cortactin Oncogene Cortactin and membrane dynamics SA Weed and JT Parsons 6423 repeats domain , and the fourth repeat in cortactin as well as the three repeats in HS1 bind to phosphatidy - linositol 4 , 5 bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) ( He et al . , 1998 ) , which has been shown to regulate the interaction of several actin - binding proteins with F - actin ( Sechi and Wehland , 2000 ) . Recombinant cortactin has been reported to crosslink F - actin ( Huang et al . , 1997 ) , an activity attributed to the sixth cortactin repeat ( Ohoka and Takai , 1998 ) . This is somewhat controversial , since recombinant constructs lacking the fourth but contain - ing the sixth repeat fail to bind F - actin ( Weed et al . , 2000 ) and crosslinking has not been detected by other groups under similar conditions ( H Wu and JT Parsons , unpublished observations ; Weaver et al . , 2001 ) . Whereas binding of cortactin to F - actin is not inﬂuenced by Src phosphorylation ( Wu and Parsons , 1993 ) , Src phosphorylation has been reported to inhibit the crosslinking ability of cortactin ( Huang et al . , 1997 ) . In addition , PIP 2 binding to cortactin also inhibits F - actin crosslinking ( He et al . , 1998 ) , although in this case it is not known if this is due to an inability of the cortactin / PIP 2 complex to bind actin . Since cortactin contains a single F - actin binding site ( Weed et al . , 2000 ) and multimeric forms of cortactin have not been detected ( Ohoka and Takai , 1998 ; Wu and Parsons , unpublished observations ) cortactin must crosslink F - actin by an undetermined mechanism that will require further elucidation . Activated ( GTP - bound ) Cdc42 and Rac interact with a number of proteins that regulate assembly of the cortical actin cytoskeleton ( Aspenstrom , 1999 ) . It is now well established that members of the Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein family , or WASps , play a pivotal role in mediating Cdc42 and Rac e(cid:128)ects on the actin cytoskeleton ( Takenawa and Miki , 2001 ) . The prototypic member , WASp , binds directly to Cdc42 and induces clusters of actin ﬁlaments in cells dependent on the unmasking of a C - terminal acidic region ( Machesky and Insall , 1998 ) . Expression of WASp is restricted to lymphoid and hemopoietic cells while a second family member closely related to WASp , termed N - WASp , also directly binds Cdc42 . N - WASp is ubiquitously expressed and contributes directly to Cdc42 - induced ﬁlopodia formation in most cell types ( Miki et al . , 1998a ) . WASp and N - WASp are also activated by molecules other than Cdc42 , including PIP 2 ( Higgs and Pollard , 2000 ; Rohatgi et al . , 2000 ) , the proteins WISH ( Fukuoka et al . , 2001 ) and WIP ( Martinez - Quiles et al . , 2001 ) , indicating that multiple signaling pathways are utilized in WASp activation . Another WASP - like protein , termed Scar1 or WAVE , plays a central role in Rac - induced cortical actin dynamics ( Bear et al . , 1998 ; Miki et al . , 1998b ) . Scar1 / WAVE is structurally similar to WASp , sharing strong homology to the carboxy - terminal acidic domain ( Miki et al . , 1998b ) . The activation of Scar1 / Wave by Rac is indirect and is mediated by IRSp53 ( Miki et al . , 2000 ) . A Rac / IRSp53 complex directly binds and activates Scar1 / WAVE , which in turn promotes lamellipodia and membrane ru(cid:130)ing . Scar1 / Wave colocalizes with cortical actin within membrane ru(cid:130)es induced by activated Rac ( Miki et al . , 1998b ) . These data indicate that Scar1 / WAVE functions in a manner similar to N - WASP to promote actin poly - merization within lamellipodia . The Arp2 / 3 protein complex is now ﬁrmly estab - lished in directly mediating signals from the Cdc42 / N - WASP ( Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ) and Rac / IRSp53 / Scar1 / WAVE ( Machesky and Insall , 1998 ) pathways to induce polymerization of the cortical actin cytoskele - ton . The Arp2 / 3 complex consists of the two unconventional actins Arp ( a ctin - r elated p rotein ) 2 and 3 along with ﬁve unrelated proteins ( Pollard et al . , 2000 ) . Arp2 / 3 complex binds to the sides and pointed ( or slow - growing ) ends of actin ﬁlaments ( Mullins et Figure 3 Cortactin localizes at sites of dynamic actin assembly . Colocalization of cortactin ( a , c , e ) with F - actin - containing cellular structures ( b , d , f ) . ( a ) and ( b ) Localization of cortactin and F - actin in Swiss 3T3 cells spreading on ﬁbronectin . Cortactin selectively localizes with cortical F - actin within lamellipodia and not with the stress ﬁber network . A signiﬁcant pool of cortactin is also found in the perinuclear region . ( c ) and ( d ) Redistribution of cortactin and F - actin into podosomes in v - Src transformed NIH3T3 cells . In addition to its cortical and perinuclear localization , cortactin is also present in ‘rosettes’ or podosomes resultant from transformation by oncogenic non - receptor tyrosine kinases . ( e ) and ( f ) Cortactin localization is coincident with F - actin tails in Listeria monocytogenes - infected Swiss 3T3 cells . Arrowheads denote sites of cortactin and F - actin colocalization Cortactin and membrane dynamics SA Weed and JT Parsons 6424 Oncogene al . , 1998 ) , nucleating de novo actin polymerization , producing barbed end ( fast growing ) ‘daughter’ ﬁlaments attached to the sides of preexisting ‘mother’ ﬁlaments ( Machesky et al . , 1999 ; Amann and Pollard , 2001 ) . Binding of the carboxy - terminal acidic region of WASp family proteins enhances Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin nucleation ( Machesky et al . , 1999 ) and in the case of Scar1 / Wave , this region binds directly to the 21 kDa Arp2 / 3 subunit ( Machesky and Insall , 1998 ) . This interaction forms a molecular complex indirectly linking Rac to the actin cytoskeleton through IRSp53 . For N - WASp , the interaction is direct since Cdc42 directly binds N - WASp to stimulate ﬁlopodia ( Miki et al . , 1998a ) . The observation that carboxy - terminal fragments of WASP - family proteins are more active than the full - length protein at promoting actin nucleation coupled with the requirement for activated Cdc42 or Rac to elicit actin polymerization has led to the proposal that activation of N - WASp or Scar1 / WAVE is achieved by GTPase - mediated targeting to the cortical membrane . This is followed by a conformational change exposing the carboxy - terminal acidic domain to allow binding of the Arp2 / 3 complex and subsequent actin polymerization ( Machesky et al . , 1999 ; Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ) . The sidebinding , pointed end capping and nucleation ability of Arp2 / 3 complex results in the formation of Y - shaped branched net - works observed in vitro ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ; Blanchoin et al . , 2000a ) and in vivo ( Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ) . Phosphate released from aged ADP - Pi actin ﬁlaments leads to disassembly of Arp2 / 3 - induced actin networks at branch points ( Blanchoin et al . , 2000a , b ) . The debranching process is enhanced by the activity of actin depolymerizing factor ( ADF ) / coﬁlin , which also depolymerizies and severs F - actin ﬁlaments ( Maciver , 1998 ) . ADF / coﬁlin localizes at sites distal to that of Arp2 / 3 complex , placing it in the proper position to breakdown Arp2 / 3 - induced actin networks within lamellipodia ( Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ) . Coﬁlin severing activity is abolished following phosphorylation by the Rac e(cid:128)ector LIM kinase ( Yang et al . , 1998 ) , which in turn is activated by a second Cdc42 / Rac e(cid:128)ector , PAK ( Edwards et al . , 1999 ) . The coordinated activities of LIM kinase and PAK therefore serve to attenuate actin networks resultant from Arp2 / 3 activa - tion . In addition to WASp family proteins , cortactin also binds to Arp2 / 3 complex and stimulates actin nuclea - tion activity ( Weed et al . , 2000 ; Weaver et al . , 2001 ; Uruno et al . , 2001 ) . Binding of cortactin to Arp2 / 3 is mediated through a three amino acid motif in the NTA domain ( - 20DDW ) conserved in many Arp2 / 3 activat - ing proteins ( Figure 2b ) . Cortactin’s ability to stimulate Arp2 / 3 activity requires both the DDW motif and the actin binding domain ( Weaver et al . , 2001 ; Uruno et al . , 2001 ) , domains that are also required for Rac - mediated localization of cortactin to cortical actin networks ( Weed et al . , 2000 ) . While the ability of cortactin to stimulate Arp2 / 3 activity is weaker than that of N - WASp , cortactin enhances N - WASp - induced Arp2 / 3 activation ( Weaver et al . , 2001 ) . This synergy suggests that cortactin can function cooperatively with WASp proteins in addition to independently activating Arp2 / 3 complex . Evidence for an alternative mechan - ism of Arp2 / 3 activation by cortactin is supported by the lower a(cid:129)nity of cortactin for Arp2 / 3 complex ( Weed et al . , 2000 ) and by the inability of cortactin to interact with individual Arp2 / 3 subunits in a yeast two - hybrid assay ( LM Machesky , personal communica - tion ) . In addition , N - WASP and cortactin are di(cid:128)er - entially localized in Vaccinia - induced actin tails ( Zettl and Way , 2001 ) . Cortactin also inhibits debranching of aged Arp2 / 3 networks ( Weaver et al . , 2001 ) suggesting that cortactin also serves to stabilize the interaction between Arp2 / 3 complex and mother / daughter ﬁlament networks . The association of cortactin with mobile cortical actin structures determined by live cell imaging points to a functional role for cortactin in regulating Arp2 / 3 activity ( Dai et al . , 2000 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2000 ) . Activation of Cdc42 and Rac are required for cell migration ( Nobes and Hall , 1999 ) , with the resultant Arp2 / 3 activity widely believed to be responsible for protrusive - based cell motility mediated by these GTPases ( Borisy and Svitkina , 2000 ) . The ability of cortactin to bind and activate Arp2 / 3 complex indicates a role for cortactin in actin - based motility events . Enhanced cell migration in NIH3T3 and endothelial cells overexpressing cortactin supports this notion ( Patel et al . , 1998 ; Huang et al . , 1998 ) . While cortactin stimulated cell motility can be attributed to enhanced Arp2 / 3 activity , Src phosphorylation of cortactin also appears to play an important role in cell migration . Src activation and cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation are also closely coordinated in ﬁbro - blast cell motility induced by FGF - 1 ( LaVallee et al . , 1998 ; Liu et al . , 1999 ) or in carcinoma cells by CD44 binding to HA ( Bourguignon et al . , 2001 ) . Rac is also activated under these conditions ( Johnston et al . , 1995 ; Oliferenko et al . , 2000 ) , and is responsible for recruiting Src to the cell periphery ( Fincham et al . , 1996 ) . Collectively these data point to a role for cortactin in integrating cell motility signaling pathways involving activation of Arp2 / 3 complex and Src . Furthermore , several intracellular pathogens utilize Arp2 / 3 complex - based actin polymerization for intra - cellular movement ( Frischknecht and Way , 2001 ) and cortactin is found in the ‘rocketing’ actin tails of many ( if not all ) of these microbes , including Listeria ( Figure 3e , f ) , Shigella and Vaccinia ( Zettl and Way , 2001 ) . Pathogen - induced Arp2 / 3 actin networks are structu - rally similar to those found in lamellipodia , suggesting a similar mechanism of assembly ( Cameron et al . , 2001 ) . While in the case of Vaccinia , cellular infection results in Src activation and cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation ( Frischknecht et al . , 1999a ) , it is not likely that cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation contri - butes to Vaccinia motility since tyrosine phosphoryla - tion is restricted to the virus body and is not present in actin tails ( Frischknecht et al . , 1999b ) . The lack of tyrosine phosphorylation in Vaccinia ( and endosome ) actin tails suggests that Src phosphorylation of Oncogene Cortactin and membrane dynamics SA Weed and JT Parsons 6425 cortactin does not inﬂuence cortactin’s ability to activate and stabilize Arp2 / 3 - mediated networks . Function of cortactin SH3 - domain binding proteins Cortactin interacts with several proteins though its carboxyl terminal SH3 domain . The binding of SH3 domains to proline - rich sequence motifs has been well established ( Kay et al . , 2000 ) and based on screening of phage display peptide libraries , the cortactin SH3 domain binds to a consensus sequence of + PP C PXKP ( Sparks et al . , 1996b ) . Yeast two hybrid screening of brain libraries with the cortactin SH3 domain led to the identiﬁcation of ﬁrst cortactin SH3 domain - binding protein , termed cortactin binding protein 1 ( CortBP1 ) ( Du et al . , 1998 ) . Subsequent studies determined that CortBP1 is identical ProSAP1 ( Boeckers et al . , 1999a ) and to a splice variant of Shank2 ( Naisbitt et al . , 1999 ) , which is a member of the Shank family of sca(cid:128)olding proteins ( Sheng and Kim , 2000 ) . Abun - dantly expressed in neurons , CortBP1 and the related protein Shank3 contain a canonical cortactin SH3 domain - binding sequence ( KPPVPPKP ) ( Figure 2d ) which mediates binding to cortactin ( Du et al . , 1998 ) . Shank proteins serve as molecular sca(cid:128)olds at post - synaptic sites ( PSD ) of excitatory synapses , and are characterized by the presence of an amino - terminal PSD95 / dlg / ZO - 1 ( PDZ ) domain . The CortBP1 PDZ domain directly binds to the carboxyl terminus of the transmembrane type 2 somatostatin receptor ( Zitzer et al . , 1999 ) and the a - latrotoxin receptor CL1 ( Kreien - kamp et al . , 2000 ; Tobaben et al . , 2000 ) . In addition , Shank1 and Shank3 contain a set of seven ankyrin repeats and an SH3 domain proximal to the PDZ domain ( Sheng and Kim , 2000 ) . While a ligand for the Shank SH3 domain has not been reported , the ankyrin repeats interact with a novel protein of unknown function termed sharpin , which can multmerize through an amino terminal coiled - coil region ( Lim et al . , 2001 ) . The PDZ domain of CortBP1 and Shank3 also interacts with the carboxyl terminus of GKAP ( Naisbitt et al . , 1999 ; Boeckers et al . , 1999b ) , a cytosolic PSD protein that binds through its amino terminal region to the C - terminal guanylate kinase - like domain of PSD - 95 ( Kim et al . , 1997 ) . The amino terminal region of PSD - 95 contains three tandem PDZ motifs , the ﬁrst two which are capable of directly interacting with the carboxyl terminus of both the NMDA receptor ( Kornau et al . , 1995 ) and the Shaker K + channel ( Kim et al . , 1995 ) . Additionally , the PDZ domain of Shank3 directly interacts with the carboxyl terminus of the group 1 metabotropic receptors mGluR1a and mGluR5 as well as indirectly binding to these receptors through Homer ( Tu et al . , 1999 ) . Homer is a protein localized in PSDs that posses an Enabled / VASP homology domain ( EVH ) that interacts with a proline - rich segment on Shank3 proximal to the cortactin binding site ( Tu et al . , 1999 ) . The Homer EVH domain is capable of simultaneously interacting with Shank3 and either the carboxyl terminus of mGluR receptors ( Xiao et al . , 1998 ) or with the cytoplasmic amino terminus of inositol trisphosphate receptors ( IP3R ) ( Tu et al . , 1998 ) . Homer therefore serves as a sca(cid:128)old for coupling mGluR and IP3 receptors to Shank3 , and links these receptors to NMDA and Shaker K + signaling pathways . CortBP1 / Shank proteins also contain a sterile alpha motif ( SAM ) domain at the extreme carboxyl terminus that serves as a homo - and / or heterodimerization domain ( Naisbitt et al . , 1999 ) . The carboxyl terminus of Homer proteins contains a coiled - coil domain that functions in an analogous manner to SAM domains ( Xiao et al . , 1998 ) . The ability of Shank and Homer proteins to dimerize in various combinations contributes to the overall complexity of receptor organization at the PSD . The precise level of bridging between various receptors within the PSD is likely to be further complicated given the abundant alternative splicing that occurs in both Shank and Homer gene products ( Lim et al . , 1999 ; Soloviev et al . , 2000 ) . Shanks , cortactin and Arp2 / 3 complex are present in neuronal growth cones ( Du et al . , 1998 ; Goldberg et al . , 2000 ) and given the ability to bind to both CortBP1 and Shank 3 molecular ‘bridges’ , cortactin can serve to link multiple postsynaptic receptors to sites of Arp2 / 3 mediated actin assembly ( Figure 4 ) . Therefore , clustering and organization of receptor components at the synapse may in part be attributable to Arp2 / 3 mediated actin polymerization regulated by cortactin in a manner similar to that described for the movement and formation of acet - ylcholine receptor clusters ( Dai et al . , 2000 ) . Shank proteins have been recently observed in non - neuronal tissues ( Redecker et al . , 2001 ) , indicating that they may also participate in receptor organization at sites other than the PSD . It of interest to note that the cortactin SH3 domain - binding sequence found in Shanks is also present in the murine form of Xin , a muscle - speciﬁc protein implicated in cardiac morphogenesis ( Wang et al . , 1999 ) . The cortactin SH3 domain also interacts with a novel brain - speciﬁc protein of unknown function termed CBP90 though a proline - rich sequence that di(cid:128)ers from the binding sequence in Shank proteins ( Figure 2d ; Ohoka and Takai , 1998 ) . The epithelial tight junction is another region of subcellular specialization where cortactin may partici - pate in organizing transmembrane receptor networks ( Figure 4 ) . Tight junctions form a barrier between adjacent polarized epithelia that restricts the movement of immune cells and solutes between cells . In addition , they establish a di(cid:128)usion barrier for integral membrane proteins within individual cells by dividing the plasma membrane into apical and basolateral domains ( Tsukita et al . , 1999 ) . Tight junctions are associated with an apical cytoskeletal structure known as the terminal web ( Fath et al . , 1993 ) . Cortactin is localized at the terminal web in human small bowel epithelium ( Wu and Montone , 1998 ) and the SH3 domain associates with a proline - rich motif in ZO - 1 ( Katsube et al . , 1998 ) , a protein selectively localized to the epithelial tight junction ( Stevenson et al . , 1986 ) . The ZO - 1 proline - rich domain contains a homologous Cortactin and membrane dynamics SA Weed and JT Parsons 6426 Oncogene sequence to the consensus cortactin SH3 domain - binding motif ( Figure 2d ) . The ZO - 1 domain structure is similar to that of PSD - 95 , containing three amino terminal PDZ domains , an SH3 domain , a guanylate kinase - like domain and a carboxyl - terminal proline rich motif ( Willott et al . , 1993 ; Itoh et al . , 1993 ) . Based on its localization and domain structure , ZO - 1 is thought to participate in the biogenesis and regulation of tight junction assembly ( Sheth et al . , 1997 ) . Consistent with this , the guanylate kinase - like domain of ZO - 1 interacts with cytoplasmic motifs of occludin ( Furuse et al . , 1994 ; Fanning et al . , 1998 ) while the ﬁrst PDZ domain binds the carboxyl terminus of claudin ( Itoh et al . , 1999a ) , two transmembrane proteins that are implicated in forming the paracellular seal between adjacent cells ( Furuse et al . , 1993 , 1998a , b ) . ZO - 1 contains a centrally located SH3 domain that interacts with the transcription factor ZONAB ( Balda and Matter , 2000 ) . ZO - 1 is homo - logous to two other tight junction associated proteins , ZO - 2 and ZO - 3 ( Jesaitis and Goodenough , 1994 ; Haskins et al . , 1998 ) which share the same domain structure as ZO - 1 . ZO - 1 forms binary complexes with ZO - 2 and ZO - 3 ( Wittchen et al . , 1999 ) , with ZO - 1 / ZO - 2 binding mediated through the second PDZ domains of both proteins ( Fanning et al . , 1998 ; Itoh et al . , 1999b ) . The ﬁrst PDZ domain of ZO - 2 and ZO - 3 also bind to the carboxyl terminus of claudin ( Itoh et al . , 1999a ) and the amino - terminal region of both proteins also associate with occludin ( Itoh et al . , 1999b ; Haskins et al . , 1998 ) . All three ZO proteins also bind F - actin ( Wittchen et al . , 1999 ) , which in ZO - 1 is mediated through sequences in the proline - rich domain ( Fanning et al . , 1998 ) , thus linking and organizing occludin and claudin clusters within the tight junction membrane . The ZO - 1 proline - rich domain also mediates interaction with the Ras e(cid:128)ector AF - 6 ( Yamamoto et al . , 1997 ) . While the interactions of the various ZO proteins are more complex than PSD sca(cid:128)olding proteins in terms of their association with the actin cytoskeleton , the binding of cortactin to ZO - 1 suggests that the tight junction complex in part is linked to Arp2 / 3 complex , and further suggests that indirect regulation of transmembrane complexes by attachment to sites of cortical actin assembly is a hallmark of cortactin function . How Arp2 / 3 driven actin polymerization contributes to tight junction organization remains unexplored . Figure 4 Cortactin serves to link diverse sca(cid:128)olding protein complexes to Arp2 / 3 - driven actin polymerization . Schematic representation of the proposed molecular interactions within the neuronal post - synaptic density ( top ) , epithelial tight junction ( bottom left ) and in receptor mediated endocytosis ( bottom right ) . In all cases , cortactin ( red ) is proposed to interact through its SH3 domain with proline - rich segments within numerous sca(cid:128)olding proteins , including Shank proteins , ZO - 1 and dynamin 2 . These multiprotein sca(cid:128)olds are in turn linked to the Arp2 / 3 complex ( dark green ) and associated actin cytoskeleton through sequences within the cortactin NTA and repeat domains . Protein domains are : a , cortactin NTA ; rep , cortactin repeats ; 3 , SH3 ; PZ , PDZ ; PP , proline - rich ; SM , SAM ; GK , guanylate kinase - like domain ; ANK , ankyrin - like repeats ; EVH , Enabled / VASP homology ; CC , coiled - coil , RH , RBCK1 homology ; PH , pleckstrin homolgy ; GED , GTPase e(cid:128)ector domain ; ADF , actin depolymerizing factor homology ; VC , verprolin / coﬁlin and acidic region in N - WASP Oncogene Cortactin and membrane dynamics SA Weed and JT Parsons 6427 Besides transmembrane receptor complex organiza - tion , cortactin also plays a role in coupling Arp2 / 3 complex - mediated actin dynamics to endocytosis and vesicle movement by binding to dynamin 2 ( Figure 4 ) . Dynamins comprise a family of a large GTPases that play a fundamental role in the ﬁssion and recycling of membrane vesicles during receptor mediated endocy - tosis ( Schmid , 1997 ) . Dynamins contain a GTP hydrolysis domain within the amino terminus , followed by a linker region , a phospholipid binding pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain , a GTPase e(cid:128)ector domain and a proline - rich domain at the carboxyl terminus ( Schmid et al . , 1998 ) . The SH3 domain of cortactin can interact with two di(cid:128)erent proline motifs within the dynamin 2 proline - rich domain as determined by peptide competi - tion studies ( McNiven et al . , 2000 ) . Like cortactin , dynamin 2 translocates into membrane ru(cid:130)es following PDGF stimulation of NIH3T3 cells . The growth factor - induced tranlocation of dynamin 2 to lamellipodia is inhibited in cells expressing cortactin constructs lacking the SH3 domain , pointing to a functional requirement for cortactin in targeting dynamin 2 to sites of membrane ru(cid:130)ing ( McNiven et al . , 2000 ) . A second protein that may participate in localizing dynamin to lamellipodia in a similar manner is mAbp1 . The SH3 domain of mAbp1 also binds to the dynamin proline - rich region and is localized with dynamin at sites of endocytosis ( Kessels et al . , 2001 ) . mAbp1 is a Src substrate ( Lock et al . , 1998 ) , binds F - actin at two sites through its ADF - H domain , and is translocated to the cortical cytoskeleton following Rac activation ( Kessels et al . , 2000 ) . While the yeast homolog of mAbp1 , Abp1p , interacts with and activates Arp2 / 3 complex through two DDW motifs ( Goode et al . , 2001 ) , mAbp1 does not contain a DDW motif and is therefore not likely to participate in Arp2 / 3 complex activation . A third SH3 domain containing protein that couples the actin cytoskeleton to dyamin is syndapin , which also localizes with dynamin at sites of endocytosis ( Qual - mann et al . , 1999 ) . Syndapin directly binds N - WASp , and overepxression of syndapin leads to ﬁlopodia formation dependent on Arp2 / 3 complex activity ( Qualmann and Kelly , 2000 ) providing a second molecular link between dynamin and Arp2 / 3 complex in mammalian cells . Overexpression of the mAbp1 or syndapin SH3 domain inhibits endocytosis ( Kessels et al . , 2001 ; Qualmann and Kelly , 2000 ) , further high - lighting the functional importance of linking dynamin to the cortical actin skeleton in endocytic events . The association of dynamin with clathrin - coated pits is actin - independent , and is mediated through amphiphy - sins I and II ( Wigge and McMahon , 1998 ) . The amphiphysin SH3 domain binds to sequences in the dynamin proline - rich region ( David et al . , 1996 ) while the amino terminal region of amphiphysins interact with clathrin ( Ramjaun et al . , 1997 ) and the clathrin - binding adaptor protein AP2 ( David et al . , 1996 ) . How the activities of cortactin , mAbp1 , syndapin and amphipy - sin regulate the cortical actin cytoskeleton and coordinate with dynamin GTPase activity during endocytic membrane ﬁssion is highly complex . It has been proposed that Arp2 / 3 activity is involved in regulating membrane morphology and movement in pre - and post - endocytic events ( Qualmann et al . , 2000 ) . Support for the involvement of cortactin in post endocytic vesicle dynamics comes from the localization of cortactin to actin tails of cytoplasmic rocketing endosomes ( Kaksonen et al . , 2000 ; Schafer et al . , 2000 ) , an activity that is dependent on Arp2 / 3 activation ( Taunton et al . , 2000 ) . Actin tails on endosomes are strikingly similar to tails produced by intracellular pathogens , suggesting that cortactin plays a similar role by the simultaneous stimulation and stabilization of Arp2 / 3 - induced actin networks . Taken together , these results suggest that Arp2 / 3 activation and actin network stabilization is a conserved cellular function of cortactin , and this activity is utilized directly for actin - based motility as well as indirectly through the interaction of SH3 binding proteins to dynamically regulate transmembrane protein organization . Overexpression and role of cortactin in human tumors A large body of evidence indicates that cortactin plays an important role in human neoplasia . The human cDNA encoding cortactin ( termed EMS1 ) was isolated by the cloning of genes found in human carcinoma cell lines containing ampliﬁed copies of the chromosome 11q13 region ( Schuuring et al . , 1991 ) . The ampliﬁed region typically ranges from 3 – 5 Mb in size and contains several DNA markers , including the onco - genes cyclin D1 ( PRAD1 ) , INT2 / FGF3 , HSTF1 / FGF4 and BCL1 that are often found in a variety of human tumors ( Lammie and Peters , 1991 ) . Ampliﬁcation of 11q13 occurs most frequently in carcinomas of the head and neck ( 29 % ) , ovary ( 20 % ) , bladder ( 15 % ) , breast ( 13 % ) and lung ( 13 % ) ( Schuuring , 1995 ) . Individuals with carcinomas con - taining chromosome 11q13 ampliﬁcations have a poor prognosis ( Schuuring et al . , 1992 ; Meredith et al . , 1995 ) . While overexpression of FGF3 , FGF4 and BCL1 is rarely observed in the above listed cancers ( Liscia et al . , 1989 ; Fantl et al . , 1990 ) , in the majority of cases expression levels of cyclin D1 and cortactin are dramatically increased ( Bringuier et al . , 1996 ; Hui et al . , 1998 ) . Cyclin D1 is a cell cycle regulatory protein that is essential for passage through G 1 ( Baldin et al . , 1993 ) , and overexpression in human tumors is thought to lead to a loss of cell cycle regulation ( Schuuring , 1995 ) . Ampliﬁcation of the cortactin locus can occur with or without cyclin D1 ampliﬁcation , and elevated cortactin gene levels correlate with poor patient prognosis ( Rodrigo et al . , 2000 ) , suggesting that ampliﬁcation of the cortactin gene directly contributes to tumor severity . Cell lines isolated from patients with 11q13 ampliﬁcation exhibit increased cortactin mRNA and protein levels ( Patel et al . , 1996 ; Campbell et al . , 1996 ) , providing strong circumstantial evidence that cortactin overexpression plays an important role in tumors with 11q13 ampliﬁcation . Cortactin and membrane dynamics SA Weed and JT Parsons 6428 Oncogene Based on observations of cortactin localization and function in non - transformed cells , overexpression of cortactin in human tumors has been proposed to result in increased cell migration and metastatic potential ( Schuuring , 1995 ) . Support for this comes from increased cell migration but not growth rates in NIH3T3 ﬁbroblasts overexpressing cortactin ( Patel et al . , 1998 ) . Although not directly addressed , the increase in cell motility is likely due to increased Arp2 / 3 activation and lamellipodia extension as described above . In addition , cortactin redistributes into aberrant cell - matrix contact sites in v - Src transformed cells and in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma lines overexpressing cortactin ( Figure 3c , d ; Wu et al . , 1991 ; Schuuring et al . , 1993 ) . These contact sites , known as podosomes or rosettes , consist of invaginations of ventral plasma membrane ringed by circular actin - rich structures abundant in tyrosine phosphorylated cytos - keletal adhesion proteins ( Tarone et al . , 1985 ) . Podosomes are also found in osteoclasts ( Marchisio et al . , 1984 ) where they contribute to bone resorption ( Tanaka et al . , 1996 ) and in macrophages ( Davies and Stossel , 1977 ) where they are involved in cell motility ( Linder et al . , 1999 ) . In v - Src transformed cells , podosomes are sites of increased extracellular matrix degradation ( Chen et al . , 1985 ) caused by elevated membrane metalloproteinase activity ( Chen and Wang , 1999 ) . The resulting decrease in cell - matrix adhesion likely contributes to the rounded transformed pheno - type observed in v - Src transformed cells ( Kellie et al . , 1991 ) and therefore may lead to increased metastatic potential . The actin cytoskeleton surrounding podo - somes is highly labile ( Ochoa et al . , 2000 ) , sensitive to changes in Rac activity ( Ory et al . , 2000 ) , and is regulated in macrophages by WASp - mediated Arp2 / 3 activation ( Linder et al . , 1999 , 2000 ) . The presence of cortactin in podosomes of Src transformed cells coupled with the appearance of podosomes in tumor cells that overexpress cortactin strongly suggests that cortactin plays a role in regulating podosome actin and membrane dynamics . This is supported by the coincident localization of dynamin 2 with cortactin in the podosomes of multiple cell types ( Ochoa et al . , 2000 ) . A role for cortactin in tumor cell invasion is further borne out by the localization of cortactin within invadopodia of invasive breast cancer cells ( Bowden et al . , 1999 ) . Invadopodia are unique to transformed cells , occurring in the center of the cell and extending well into the neighboring substratum ( Chen and Wang , 1999 ) . Invadopodia exhibit robust membrane bound matrix metaloproteinase activity ( Kelly et al . , 1994 ) which facilitates the invasion of human breast cancer cells ( Kelly et al . , 1998 ) . Tumor cell motility and invasion also requires the activity of Cdc42 and Rac ( Keely et al . , 1997 ; Banyard et al . , 2000 ) , which in part contributes to endocytosis and proteolysis of extracellular matrix components ( Kher - admand et al . , 1998 ; Banyard et al . , 2000 ) . Rac - mediated recruitment of cortactin into podosomes and invadopodia would therefore serve to enhance the ability of cortactin to regulate the Arp2 / 3 - mediated assembly of the cortical actin meshwork , a process that would be further attenuated in tumor cells with elevated cortactin levels . The observation that overexpression of the cortactin NTA domain in invasive MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cells disrupts large cytoplasmic actin aggregates ( which may provide the structural precurser elements for invado - podia formation ) ( Uruno et al . , 2001 ) also supports a role for cortactin in tumor cell adhesion and invasion . Perspectives Regulation of the cortical actin cytoskeleton is fundamental to a wide range of dynamic cellular events . Signaling pathways utilized in the control of plasma membrane dynamics and organization require reorganization of the cortical actin cytoskeleton . Dynamic changes in the actin skeleton require the coordinated activity of tyrosine kinase and Rho GTPase signaling pathways . Molecules at the ‘cross - roads’ of these two pathways , such as cortactin , play an important role in integrating and mediating cellular responses . As discussed above , cortactin plays important roles in tyrosine kinase signaling pathways that involve alterations in cell morphology . Regula - tion of the cortical cytoskeleton is central to changes in cell morphology , and the direct role of cortactin in Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin dynamics indicates that an important function of cortactin is to regulate actin - based motility . The interaction of cortactin with PDZ sca(cid:128)olding proteins and with dynamin indicates that cortactin serves to link transmembrane receptor complexes and membrane vesicle dynamics to areas of active actin polymerization . This linkage is likely to be critical for the organization of receptor complexes and for vesicle motility . Increased cortactin levels in human cancers augments tumor cell adhesion , motility and invasion in a manner that likely involves changes in Arp2 / 3 dynamics . In spite of recent advances in understanding cortactin func - tion , much remains to be discovered . Although tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin is associated with cell motility and morphological changes , the molecular consequences of tyrosine and / or serine / threonine phosphorylation remain unclear . Does tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin by kinases such as Src , Fer or Syk create binding sites for SH2 - containing proteins and if so , what is their contribu - tion to cortactin function ? Do other tyrosine kinases phosphorylate cortactin ? How does MEK - meditated serine / threonine phosphorylation impact cortactin function , and are other kinases involved ? While the identiﬁcation of cortactin SH3 domain - binding pro - teins such as CortBP1 , ZO - 1 and dynamin point to a indirect role for cortactin in membrane organization , how cortactin binding ultimately inﬂuences synaptic organization , tight junction assembly and vesicle biogenesis is unknown . The existence of Shank Oncogene Cortactin and membrane dynamics SA Weed and JT Parsons 6429 proteins in non - neuronal tissues also raises the likelihood that additional transmembrane protein complexes are regulated by cortactin . What are the events leading to chromosome 11q13 ampliﬁcation and cortactin overexpression ? Finally , how does cortactin inﬂuence podosome and invadopodia activ - ity ? These questions and others will likely be the subject of much investigation in the years to come .
