In particular , exosomes are 50 (cid:1) 100 nm particles secreted by a range of normal mammalian cells into body ﬂuids such as saliva , 5 blood , 6 and urine 7 via exocytosis . 8 Although their physiological functions are unclear , recently salivary exo - somes have gained signiﬁcance as biomark - ers for oral cancer . 4 Exosomes possess a cell - type - speciﬁc lipid - bilayer membrane containing cytosolic proteins , formed by exocytosis through an inward budding of the cell membrane . 9 Their role in specialized functions such as antigen presentation , in - tercellular communication , shuttling m - RNA / mi - RNA , 6 , 10 or infectious agents re - ﬂects a well - developed structure and func - tional organization of these nanovesicles . 11 Investigating individual exosomes also has important implications in understanding their fundamental physiological role and biomarker functions and for therapeutic en - capsulation . 12 Exosome characterization typically in - cludes morphological analysis 13 which , given their nanoscale size , has been exclu - sively visualized with transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) using stained samples precluding the possibility to obtain addi - tional biochemical and mechanical informa - tion . Exosomes vary widely in cell - type - speciﬁc proteins and physiological conditions of the originating cell . 14 Semi - quantitative proteomic 14 and transcrip - tional analysis based on exosome popula - tions 15 rather than single vesicles are inadequate for analysis of proteins / recep - tors on single exosomes , thus structural and surface molecular characterization on exo - somes is generally lacking .

Speciﬁcally , human saliva exosomes secreted by normal cells into saliva via exocytosis are novel biomarkers showing tumor - antigen enrichment during oral cancer . Here we show the substructure of single human saliva exosomes , using a new ultrasensitive low force atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) exhibiting substructural organization unresolvable in electron microscopy . We correlate the data with ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscopy ( FESEM ) and AFM images to interpret the nanoscale structures of exosomes under varying forces . Single exosomes reveal reversible mechanical deformation displaying distinct elastic , 70 (cid:1) 100 nm trilobed membrane with substructures carrying speciﬁc transmembrane receptors . Further , we imaged and investigated , using force spectroscopy with antiCD63 IgG functionalized AFM tips , highly speciﬁc and sensitive detection of antigenCD63 , potentially useful cancer markers on individual exosomes . The quantitative nanoscale morphological , biomechanical , and surface biomolecular properties of single saliva exosomes are critical for the applications of exosomes for cancer diagnosis and as a model for developing new cell delivery systems .

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Structure of Human Saliva Exosomes at the Nanoscale Level . Previously , TEM imaging of numerous exosomes has re - vealed round vesicles with no substructure details . 15 Here AFM has enabled critical structural data compari - son with parallel imaging using high - resolution FESEM while allowing additional details on physio - chemical properties of exosomes . We measured the three - dimensional structure and subvesicular organization of isolated exosomes using tapping mode AM - AFM ( am - plitude modulated ) and PM - AFM ( phase modulated ) imaging , differing in the imaging force range and the feedback parameter used to generate images . Tapping mode ( (cid:3) 1 nN force ) height images of exosomes show fairly homogeneous round 50 (cid:1) 70 nm vesicles sur - rounded by a network of extravesicular channels ( Fig - ure 1a ) . Interestingly , at larger forces ( (cid:2) 2 nN ) , AM - AFM phase images reveal similar vesicle morphology ( Fig - ure 1b ) with diameters of 100 (cid:4) 10 nm and indent of the vesicles in the center indicative of mechanical defor - mation . Channel - like elongations between exosomes appear without a prominent phase contrast , while exo - somes show some aggregation without intervesicular fusion . At (cid:2) 2 nN forces , single exosomes ( Figure 1c ) dis - play a characteristic ring - like trilobed structure with one center appearing as a depression with characteris - tic phase contrast suggesting the role of heterogeneous density and / or viscoelastic image contrast mecha - nisms . Corresponding height images ( Figure 1d ) reveal overall consistent ﬂat (cid:2) 100 nm vesicles . The observed AFM phase contrast of exosomes indicates nonhomog - enous surface , which is tentatively attributable to the presence of proteins and / or mRNA enclosed inside the highly dense lipid membrane , consistent with previous proteomic and RNA analysis of saliva and other exo - some populations . 16 These images of single isolated sub - 100 nm saliva exosome vesicles elucidate the sub - structural organization of exosomes unreported to date . High - resolution FESEM exosome images show some aggregation ( Figure 1e ) , and single isolated vesicles show round bulging structures without a central de - pression ( Figure 1f ) . The images correlate well with the exosome structures obtained from AFM imaging where low imaging forces result in round , spherical shaped ex - osomes ( Figure 1a ) . The extravesicular channels are well - resolved and connect the exosomes as extensions ( Figure 1f ) . The higher magniﬁcation and lower voltage images show a very spherical surface ( Figure 1f ) , sug - gesting these particles have a round morphology un - less an outside force is exerted on them ( i . e . , AFM probe ) . The different exosome morphologies from tri - lobed structures with a depression to round bulging vesicles with intervesicular connections reﬂect how to - pographical and biomechanical properties of exosomes can be explored by varying imaging feedback param - eters such as force and phase set point . Biomechanical Properties of Exosomes under Variable Forces . Biomechanical properties of vesicles 17 (cid:1) 19 may play an important role in exocytosis and intercellular transport . We applied PM - AFM as a force nanomanipulation tech - nique to study exosome mechanics , local deformation , and rupture characteristics . AFM image contrast exhibit combined local forces and micromechanical properties of the sample . The apparent exosome morphology changes under increasing loading force , where the force was gradually increased and then reduced , to test for elastic vesicle shape recovery . Under the high - Figure 1 . Ultrastructure of individual saliva exosomes observed under tapping mode AM - AFM and FESEM . ( a ) Tapping mode topographic AFM image showing round morphology of isolated exosomes . ( b ) AM - AFM phase image of aggregated exosomes . Interconnections ( arrows ) lacking characteristic phase shift , probably indicate some extravesicular protein content . ( c ) At higher forces under AM - AFM ( (cid:2) 2 nN ) , representative single exosome phase images reveal trilobed substructure within the cen - ter of the vesicles . The contrast in images may be presumably attributed to variable constitutive elements ( lipid , protein , RNA ratio ) making up these structures . ( d ) Corresponding height images show a central depres - sion of the vesicles . ( e ) FESEM exosome image showing multiple exo - somes and ( f ) single isolated vesicles as round bulging structures with - out a central depression and well - resolved intervesicular connections .

The change in dimensions of the exosomes , cen - tral depression , and changes in apparent height are shown ( Figure 2e , f ) . During high force imaging , we also observed blebbing of exosome ( Figure 2 ) , suggesting a force - induced structural perturbation . As the force was lowered during imaging , their overall lateral dimen - sions decrease and the central depression becomes less apparent ( see Supporting Information Figure S1 ) . Although the decrease in apparent lateral dimension can be attributed to changes in average tip (cid:1) sample contact area , change in shape and disproportionate growth of the central depression is consistent with their mechanical deformation . Above 5 nN forces , exosomes reproducibly rupture into three major fragments through disintegration of the vesicular structure as well as small fragments (cid:2) 10 nm wide and 30 nm in length , providing an insight into dynamic modiﬁca - tions under applied stress ( see Supporting Information Figure S1 ) . Surface - Biomolecular Characteristics of Exosomes Observed under Force Spectroscopy . Structural EM probes can iden - tify receptors on vesicles 20 but are limited in structure (cid:1) function studies . Two quantitative ap - proaches to biochemical characterization of exosomes are AFM imaging of bound biofunctionalized gold beads and force spectroscopy with antiCD63 IgG func - tionalized tips for highly speciﬁc and sensitive detection of CD63 receptor cancer markers . Several EM tech - niques used functionalized gold beads to identify spe - ciﬁc target molecules on the surface structures . 21 We used antiCD63 IgG functionalized gold beads for identi - ﬁcation of exosome receptors by imaging under AFM . Visualization of labeled exosomes via antiCD63 and sec - ondary antibody coated gold beads ( Figure 3a ) clearly indicates speciﬁc recognition of CD63 molecules . Mul - tiple beads bound to exosomes indicate the presence of multiple CD63 molecules over a single membrane . This was veriﬁed by using nonspeciﬁc primary antibody as control showing no preference for exosome binding . Figure 3b shows interaction forces between antibody - coated AFM tips and the exosome surface . Figure 2 . Mechanical deformation of single exosomes during increased imaging force under PM - AFM . ( a - d ) Consecutive phase images of the same exosome showing vesicle size as a function of applied force imaged under forward ( i ) and back - ward ( ii ) scan direction for each force set point . Increasing imaging forces ( a (cid:1) d ) cause the overall lateral dimensions to in - crease and the central depression occupies more of the apparent structure . Blebbing of exosomes at high forces ( c , d ) a bleb or pinch observed on the exosome surfaces suggests structural perturbation . Forward tip movement possibly results in back - ward folding of the bleb on the exosome structure , whereas during backward scan the bleb is extended farther away from the exosome displayed as a protrusion . Bleb may result from a combination of mechanical stress well as inherent structural conﬁguration of the exosomes . ( e ) Cross sectional analysis of exosome structure under varying forces .

Much weaker adhesive forces ( (cid:3) 50 pN ) only were observed by nonspeciﬁc antibody tips , conﬁrming the speciﬁcity of force measurements ( Figure 3b ) . Speciﬁc antibody tip forces were in 30 (cid:1) 200 pN range , with the majority of the data falling between 40 and 115 pN . The mean interaction force from a normal distribution of the histogram was calculated from bins 40 (cid:1) 115 pN as F (cid:5) 73 . 01 (cid:4) 23 . 4 pN ( mean (cid:4) SD ) and was used to es - timate unbinding force between a single CD63 tet - raspanin molecule and antibody . Though the exact ori - entation and state of antibody (cid:1) antigen interaction is likely to vary , the mean interaction forces are compa - rable to the energy spectra of the force distribution his - togram . The unbinding force is given by F (cid:5) (cid:6) H / d , where (cid:6) H is free enthalpy and d is the effective range of the potential . Typical antibody / antigen complexes with K ass from 10 2 to 10 10 M (cid:1) 1 , having free enthalpies of about 30 to 100 (cid:7) 10 (cid:1) 24 KJ / pair , 22 and binding pocket approximated as 0 . 93 nm from biotin / streptavidin data give a force of about 100pN , 23 which corresponds well with our mean force F (cid:5) 73 (cid:4) 23 pN ( mean (cid:4) SD ) . Con - sequently , we estimate that speciﬁc adhesion peaks re - sult from single antigen (cid:1) antibody complex bond rup - tures . Even higher forces ( (cid:2) 150 (cid:1) 200 pN ) indicate the presence of multiple tetraspanin molecules constituting the vesicle surface . Presence of CD63 molecules on ex - osomes also suggests their endosomal instead of plasma membrane origin . 24 CONCLUSIONS In summary , we have demonstrated unique struc - tural , biochemical , and mechanical characteristics of natural , biologically important human saliva exosomes at the single vesicle level . We report the distinct sub - structure of single isolated sub - 100 nm human saliva exosomes in the form of trilobed structures and demon - strate their reversible elastic nanomechanical proper - ties , which are constitutively secreted by normal mam - malian salivary gland cells and useful as novel biomarkers for detection of pathologies such as can - cer . This is demonstrated by quantitative single recep - tor level detection of the speciﬁc markers , CD63 recep - tors , on individual exosomes from human saliva via targeted antibody tip coated force spectroscopy and antibody - labeled gold beads . The recognition of single receptor molecules on biological ﬂuid derived exo - somes such as saliva can potentially detect pathophys - iology , and thereby should enable early cancer diagno - sis , where conventional methods may prove ineffective due to sensitivity limitations . Our study shows the re - versible mechanical stability of exosomes under low stress while high applied forces cause structural defor - mation and disintegration . These data are coherent with high - resolution FESEM images . As biological nano - structures , exosomes may also provide a means to en - capsulate , mimic , and enhance drug delivery systems . The characterization of naturally occurring nanostruc - tures such as exosomes individually through size , sub - structure , and mechanics also provides critical data for developing engineered exosome drug delivery carriers with inherent biocompatibility and nanoarchitecture . METHODS Exosome Isolation and Puriﬁcation : Saliva samples were obtained from healthy volunteers from the Division of Otolaryngology , Head and Neck Surgery , at the Medical Center , University of Cali - fornia , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) , CA , in accordance with a protocol ap - proved by the UCLA Institutional Review Board .

The mean age of the volunteers was 31 years ( range (cid:5) 26 (cid:1) 43 years ) . The volunteers had no history of malignancy , immune deﬁciencies , autoimmune disorders , hepa - titis , or HIV infection . Exosomes were prepared as described 15 with slight modiﬁcations . Brieﬂy , 50 mL of saliva was equally mixed with phosphate buffer saline and spun at 2600 g for 15 min to remove cells . The supernatants were then sequentially centrifuged at 12 000 g for 20 min and 120 000 g for 3 h . The 120 000 g pellet was resuspended in PBS and used for AFM analysis . AFM Imaging : Puriﬁed exosomes were diluted 1 : 100 in deion - ized water and adsorbed to freshly cleaved mica sheets , rinsed with deionized water , and dried under a gentle stream of nitro - gen . The exosomes were stable without any lysis or degradation . A home - built AFM under tapping mode AM - AFM and PM - AFM and silicon probes ( MPP - 13220 - W , spring constant , k (cid:2) 200 N m (cid:1) 1 ; Veeco ) wereused . TappingmodeAFMisbasedonAM - AFM , which detects the change in the vibration amplitude of the oscil - lating cantilever and uses it as a feedback signal to generate high - resolution images . 25 Phase images in which the phase change of the cantilever relative to the excitation signal is re - corded while the feedback maintains constant vibration ampli - tude of the cantilever , mapping variations in material properties such as sample density and viscoelasticity . Additionally , PM - AFM enabled high - resolution images of exosomes . PM - AFM de - tects phase change of the oscillating silicon cantilever relative to the excitation signal and uses it as the feedback signal to ob - tain topographic images . Although previous studies demon - strated PM - AFM for high - resolution imaging , 26 it has not been extensively used for imaging soft biological samples . Topo - graphic height and phase images were recorded simultaneously at 512 (cid:7) 512 pixels at a scan rate of 1 Hz . Image processing was performed using Gwyddion or SPIP software . Force Spectroscopy : For exosome immobilization , exosomes were diluted 1 : 50 times in PBS buffer containing 10 mM MgCl 2 / 5 mM CaCl 2 ( pH 7 . 4 ) and adsorbed to mica surface overnight at 4 °C for stable immobilization . Samples were rinsed and imaged ( Bioscope II ; Veeco ) under PBS in tapping mode using soft canti - levers ( MSCT ; Veeco ) at 0 . 25 Hz . No signiﬁcant changes were ob - served in the shape and size of exosomes under these condi - tions ( see Supporting Information Figure S2 ) . For tip functionalization , antiCD63 antibodies were attached to gold - coated AFM probes ( MSCT ; Veeco ) via thiol ester linkage as de - scribed previously 27 with experimentally determined k (cid:5) 0 . 02 N m (cid:1) 1 . The probes were washed in PBS , blocked with 1 % BSA - PBS for 1 h , followed by rinsing with PBS . All measurements were re - corded in physiological buffer conditions . Exosomes were elec - trostatically immobilized over mica , and AFM tip was positioned on top of the exosomes . Force (cid:1) separation curves were re - corded at a ramp size of 1 (cid:8) m and tip velocity of 1 (cid:8) m / s under low forces ( (cid:3) 500 pN ) . Nanoscope software was used for data analysis . No antibody or a nonspeciﬁc mouse antibody ( Anti HUR , Santa Cruz Biotechnology ) coated AFM tips were used as control . Immuno - Bead AFM Imaging : Exosomes prepared as above were incubated with 1 : 100 dilution of antiCD63 antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) , followed by 20 min incubation with 1 : 1000 dilution secondary antibody ( Molecular Probes , Invit - rogen , CA ) coated 10 nm gold particles ( Sigma Aldrich ) with con - secutive PBS washes after each binding step . Samples were rinsed with deionized water , dried , and imaged under tapping mode ( Bioscope II ; Veeco ) with silicon probes ( f (cid:5) 305 kHz , OTESPA , Veeco ) . Absence or nonspeciﬁc primary antibody served as controls . Electron Microscopy : Isolated exosomes were immobilized over UV - cleaned silicon wafers . Samples were coated with iridium for 15 s at a current of 20 mA , and the wafer edges were grounded using silver paint . Vesicles were examined under low beam ener - gies ( 1 . 5 kV at 3 . 1 pA ) with a Magellan 400 L Extreme high - resolution FESEM ( FEI Co . , Hillsboro , OR ) . Acknowledgment .
