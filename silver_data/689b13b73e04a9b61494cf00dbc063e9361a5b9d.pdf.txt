In the fluorescence microscope , filaments formed a fluorescent actin cloud 0 . 1 (cid:1) M profilin - actin is surprisingly high , considering the value of the rate constant for association of profilin - surrounding FH1 - FH2 - coated beads only in the pres - ence of profilin ( Figure 1B ) .

To clarify this point , we monitored bound FH1 - FH2 in the absence of profilin were free in solution , and the beads remained bare ( Figure 1B ) . FH2 - by fluorescence microscopy the initial rate of barbed - end growth of individual filaments using free , FH2 coated beads also stimulated filament assembly from actin but remained bare ( Figure 1B and Supplemental bound , or FH1 - FH2 bound barbed ends ( Figures 2A – 2C ) .

The value of K (cid:5) of 110 (cid:1) M (cid:3) 1 · s (cid:3) 1 at FH1 - FH2 inhibited FH1 - FH2 - induced nucleation ( Figure 1D ) , where - as FH1 - FH2 enabled profilin - actin to nucleate filaments , bound barbed ends overrides by 15 - fold the diffusion - limited rate constant ( Drenckhahn and Pollard , 1986 ) . albeit less efficiently than actin ( Figure 1E ) . This effect thus depends on the interaction between the FH1 do - Thus , FH1 - FH2 ( but not FH2 ) acts as a motor steering barbed - end assembly of profilin - actin exclusively . main and profilin .

ATP hydro - lysis on profilin bound actin lowers its affinity by 20 - fold in the presence of pure actin ( Zigmond et al . , 2003 ) . The rate of barbed - end growth increased linearly with ( Pantaloni and Carlier , 1993 ) , allowing dissociation of profilin from the barbed end . Hence , ATP hydrolysis the concentration of profilin - actin , but slows down at high concentrations of profilin - actin , indicating that limits the rate of filament growth at high profilin - actin concentrations ( Gutsche - Perelroizen et al . , 1999 ) .

Processive Assembly of Profilin - Actin by Formin 423 MgATP hydrolysis on profilin - actin by FH1 - FH2 likely accounts for the enhanced limiting rate of 340 s (cid:3) 1 for filament growth ( Figure 2E ) . In thepresence of AMPPNP , actinpolymerizes revers - ibly with identical critical concentrations ( 0 . 1 (cid:1) M ) at the two ends . FH1 - FH2 nucleated assembly of AMPPNP - actin , but profilin did not support assembly of AMPPNP - actin at FH1 - FH2 bound barbed ends ( nor at free barbed ends ) but promoted depolymerization of F - actin by se - questration ( Figure 3C ) , as it does in ADP ( Pantaloni and Carlier , 1993 ) . Hence , formin - processive function requires ATP hydrolysis . In conclusion , FH1 - FH2 - profilin - actin is a processive filament assembly machinery that accelerates hydroly - sis of actin bound ATP at barbed ends , allowing the rapid release of profilin and subsequent filament assem - bly . The increase in K (cid:5) above the diffusion - limited rate constant is another property of formin that adds up to its effect on ATP hydrolysis . Insertional Profilin - Actin Polymerization at the Surface of FH1 - FH2 - Coated Beads Generates Actin - Based Propulsion A biomimetic motility assay was designed to reconsti - tute controled formin - induced motility processes . FH2 - or FH1 - FH2 - coated beads were placed in a solution of 7 (cid:1) M rhodamine - labeled F - actin , 10 (cid:1) M ADF / cofilin , and 3 (cid:1) M profilin . This chemostat maintains a stationary amount of polymerizable G - actin via the rapid tread - milling of actin filaments ( Didry et al . , 1998 ) . In the fluo - rescence microscope , FH1 - FH2 - coated beads initiated the formation of actin cables that spontaneously bun - dled in long actin tails . The propulsive force pushed the bead forward steadily at 10 (cid:1) m / min ( Figure 4A and Supplemental Movie S2 on the Cell website ) for up to 2 hr . A laser - bleached zone of the actin tail moved away from the bead ( kymograph in Figure 4B and Supplemen - tal Movie S3 on the Cell website ) , consistent with FH1 - FH2 - driven processive insertional polymerization . In Figure 3 . mDia1 FH1 - FH2 Accelerates ATP Hydrolysis Associated agreement with biochemical data , no bead movement with Profilin - Actin Assembly was observed in solutions of only actin and ADF , nor Polymerization of (cid:6) - [ 32 P ] - ATP - labeled CaATP - G - actin 1 : 1 complex when profilin was replaced by ciboulot .

The motor has the following features : first , the rate constant for profilin - dynamic origin ( Frisch et al . , 2001 ; Brune and Kim , 1994 ) . A solution of F - actin , ADF , and profilin supports the actin association to barbed ends , K (cid:5) , is increased by 15 - fold , up to 110 (cid:1) M (cid:3) 1 · s (cid:3) 1 , by formin .

So far , such processes were thought to require the rate and duration of formin - based motile processes are regulated by capping proteins . very high cellular concentrations of polymerizable G - actin .

The environment of the ATP binding site in the formin - profilin - actin complex (cid:8) - actinin , which prevents the free rotation of individual filaments by bridging them ( data not shown ) .

Faster ATP hydro - plays a role in the motor function of formin . Yet the FH2 domain has no processive function .

The dimeric structure of FH1 - FH2 ( Xu et al . , 2004 ) solves this paradox . A model describing the processive walk of formin at barbed ends is proposed based on Force Generation by Site - Directed Processive structural and present biochemical data ( Figure 6 ) . Pro - Polymerization of Unbranched Filaments cessive assembly results from a cycle in which each of Growth of actin filaments generates a propulsive force the FH1 - FH2 protomers alternately binds the terminal of 3 . 5 pN / filament , assuming 2 (cid:1) M polymerizable actin profilin - ATP - F - actin and dissociates from subterminal ( Mogilner and Oster , 1996 ) . Like in N - WASP - Arp2 / 3 - ADP - F - actin following release of profilin .

Model for the Processive Action of Formin in Barbed - End Assembly of Profilin - Actin Processive steady barbed - end growth is described by a two - step cycle . In the first step ( bimolecular rate constant K 1 ) , profilin - actin associates to a barbed end to which formin and profilin - ATP - actin are bound . Profilin ( P ) interacts with the FH1 domain , while the FH2 domain interacts with the terminal ATP - F - actin subunit ( A ) . The resulting barbed end has terminal and subterminal PA subunits . Each PA interacts with one FH1 - FH2 subunit of the dimer . The second step accounts for the hydrolysis of ATP , release of Pi , and subsequent release of profilin from the subterminal actin subunit . A single rate constant K 2 represents the slowest of these three consecutive processes . In the steady - state cycle , all rates are equal . At low profilin - actin concentration , the slowest step that controls the cycle is step 1 ; at higher concentration of profilin - actin , step 2 ( ATP hydrolysis or release of profilin ) controls the cycle , causing the curvature of the plot ( Figure 4E ) . The structure of FH1 - FH2 being unknown , the drawn shape of the protein is illustrative and has no structural significance . to log phase , induced with 1 mM IPTG and grown for 16 hr at 16 (cid:9) C . incubation due to the turnover of filaments and redistribution of labeled actin .
