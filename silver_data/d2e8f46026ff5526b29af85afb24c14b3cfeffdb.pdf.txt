Holmberg , University of Copenhagen , Denmark ) or pBabe - puro encoding for c - src Y527F ( provided by S . Courtneidge , Van Andel Research Institute , Grand Rapids , MI ) as described previously ( Fehrenbacher et al . , 2004 ) . HCT116 colon carcinoma cells and HCT116 - derived K - Ras - depleted Hkh2 cells ( Ohmori et al . , 1997 ) were kindly provided by S . Shirasawa ( Fukuoka University , Fukuoka , Japan ) . MCF7 human ductal breast carcinoma cells used included a TNF - sensitive subclone ( MCF7 - S1 ) ( Jäättelä et al . , 1995 ) , and its vector ( MCF7 - pCEP ) and BCL2 ( MCF7 - BCL2 ) expressing derivatives ( Høyer - Hansen et al . , 2007 ) . WEHI - vector ( Wn - 902 ) and WEHI - Hsp70 ( Wn - 912 ) cells are single cell clones of WEHI - S mouse fibrosarcoma cells succesfully transfected with an empty vector or a vector encoding for human Hsp70 ( Jäättelä et al . , 1992 ) . Hspa1 - transgenic ( iMEF - Hsp70 ) and corresponding wild type ( iMEF - WT ) iMEFs were created as described and used at passages 15 - 20 ( Nylandsted et al . , 2004 ) . Human U - 2 - OS osteosarcoma , HeLa cervix carcinoma , SKOV3 ovarian carcinoma as well as PC3 and Du145 prostate carcinoma cells were obtained from ATCC . Highly metastatic SKOV3 . ip1 cell line derived by passaging SKOV3 cells in the mouse peritoneal cavity ( Yu et al . , 1993 ) was kindly provided by Robert Strauss ( Danish Cancer Society Research Center , Copenhagen , Denmark ) . Enzyme Activities Total cellular ASM activity was measured by the cleavage of HMU - PC essentially as described previously ( van Diggelen et al . , 2005 ) . Briefly , cells were harvested in water on ice and sonicated ( 15 cycles of 30 s using the Bioruptor Next Gen sonicator ) . The samples were then spun down and adjusted to contain 1 . 0 µg / µL protein . HMU - PC was dissolved in the substrate buffer ( 0 . 1 M sodium acetate buffer pH 4 . 5 , containing 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) sodium taurocholate and 0 . 02 % sodium azide ) and mixed with the samples , which were incubated at 37° C for 2 - 3 h . The reaction was quenched with 0 . 2 M glycine – NaOH buffer ( pH 10 . 7 ) containing 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) sodium dodecyl sulphate and 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) Triton X - 100 . The fluorescence of the formed HMU ( ex . = 404 nm , em . = 460 nm ) was measured employing Varioscan and correlated to a standard curve of pure HMU . Total cellular NSM activity was measured in lysates of subconfluent cells with Neutral Sphingomyelinase Assay Service kit from Echelon ( T - 1800 ) according to manufacturers protocol . Surface Plasmon Resonance ( BIAcore ) . For preparation of LUVs a lipid mixture consisting of 10 mol % sphingomyelin , 50 mol % phosphatidylcholine , 20 mol % cholesterol and 20 mol % BMP dissolved in organic solvents , was dried under a stream of argon and rehydrated in 2 mM Tris / HCl buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) ( Kolzer et al . , 2004 ) . The mixture was freeze - thawed six times , first in liquid nitrogen and then in an incubator at 37° C . After ultrasound bath for 5 min the mixture was passed 21 times through a polycarbonate membrane with a pore diameter of 100 nm . Surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed using a BIAcore 3000 system at 25° C . LUVs ( total lipid concentration 0 . 25 mM ) were immobilized on the surface of a L1 sensor chip ( BIAcore ) in PBS ( loading buffer ) . The running buffer used was sodium acetate buffer ( 50 mM , pH 4 . 5 ) . When acid sphingomyelinase ( 1 µM , 60 µl in running buffer ) was injected directly on the liposome surface , response units between 4100 – 5250 were obtained . After 10 min , the drugs of interest were injected in running buffer at a flow rate of 20 µl / min at the concentrations indicated . After injection a dissociation phase of 10 min was appended . Lysosomal Stability To analyse the lysosomal integrity , we used a real time imaging method of cells stained with acridine orange , a metachromatic weak base that accumulates in the acidic compartment of the cells staining them red and sensitizing them to photo - oxidation ( Kirkegaard et al . , 2010 ) . The photo - oxidation - induced loss of the lysosomal pH - gradient and leakage of acridine orange to the cytosol from individual lysosomes was quantified as an increase in green ( cytosolic ) fluorescence . Cells stained with acridine orange were exposed to 489 nm light from a 100 - mW diode laser while laser scanning micrographs where captured every 0 . 5 s ( for U - 2 - OS cells ) or 12 s ( for MEFs ) on a Zeiss LSM LIVE DUO confocal system in two channels defined by bandpass filters for 495 – 555 nm ( green ) and LP650 nm ( red ) light . A threshold in the green channel eliminating areas without cells in the recorded area was identified and applied to all recorded movies , which were subsequently analyzed by the integrated Zeiss LSM DUO software . Purification of Lysosomes Subconfluent cells were harvested and lysosomes were purified by Fe + + - dextran fractionation essentially as described previously ( Diettrich et al . , 1998 ) . Briefly , cells were loaded with Fe + + - conjugated dextran ( 10 kDa ) for 12 h , chased in fresh medium for 2 h and treated as indicated . Cells were lysed in sucrose extraction buffer ( 250 mM sucrose , 20 mM Hepes , 10 mM KCl , 1 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM EGTA , and 1 mM pefabloc , pH 7 . 5 ) using a dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 3000 g . The supernatant was loaded to a MiniMACS TM column attached to a magnet ( Miltenyi Biotec ) and trapped lysosomes were eluted in sucrose extraction buffer by removing the magnet and flushing with a plunger . The yield was approximately 18 % based on the measurements of N - acetyl - glucosaminidase activities ( Fehrenbacher et al . , 2008 ) . Cells and purified lysosomes were washed twice in cold 155 mM Ammonium Acetate in Chromasolv ® water ( pH 8 . 0 ) and stored at - 80º C . Lipid mass spectrometry Sample aliquots corresponding to 2 x 10 5 cells or lysosomes from 3 x 10 6 cells per 200 µL were spiked with 10 µL internal standard mixture containing 85 pmol phosphatidylcholine 18 : 3 / 18 : 3 , 60 pmol sphingomyelin 18 : 1 ; 2 / 17 : 0 ; 0 , 45 pmol ceramide 18 : 1 ; 2 / 17 : 0 ; 0 , 65 pmol galactosylceramide 18 : 1 ; 2 / 12 : 0 ; 0 and 65 pmol lactosylceramide 18 : 1 ; 2 / 12 : 0 ; 0 . The samples were subsequently extracted with 990 µL chloroform / methanol ( 10 : 1 , V / V ) for 90 min as previously described ( Sampaio et al . , 2011 ) . The lower organic phase was collected and evaporated . The lipid extract was dissolved in 100 µL chloroform / methanol ( 1 : 2 , V / V ) . Lipid extracts were analyzed in positive ion mode on a QSTAR Pulsar - i instrument ( AB Sciex ) equipped with a TriVersa NanoMate ( Advion Biosciences ) as described previously ( Ejsing et al . , 2006 ; Zech et al . , 2009 ) . Phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin species were monitored by precursor ion scanning for head - group specific fragment ion having m / z 184 . 07 . Ceramide , hexosylceramide , diosylceramide species were monitored by multiplexed MS / MS analysis . Fragment ion enhancement ( trapping of fragment ions in the collision cell ) was applied according to the instructions of the manufacturer and controlled by Analyst QS 1 . 1 software ( AB Sciex ) . The lipid species were identified and quantified using LipidView software ( AB Sciex ) as previously described ( Ejsing et al . , 2006 ) . Immunodetection Primary antibodies used included murine monoclonal antibodies against acid ceramidase ( BD Bioscience , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) , MDR1 / 3 ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) , Cathepsin B ( Oncogene ) , a - tubulin ( AbCam , Cambridge MA ) , MCM7 ( DCS - 141 , Neomarkers ; kindly provided by Jiri Bartek ) , Lamp2 ( Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank , Department of Biological Sciences , University of Iowa , Iowa City , IA ) and GAPDH ( Biogenesis ) . Immunodetection of proteins separated by 10 % SDS - PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose was performed using appropriate peroxidase - conjugated secondary antibodies from Dako , ECL Western blotting reagents ( Amersham ) and Luminescent Image Reader ( LAS - 1000Plus , Fujifilm ) . RNA interference All siRNAs were transfected with Oligofectamine or RNAi Max ( Invitrogen ) at 20 nM . siRNAs were designed against following 5’ – 3’ sequences : SMPD1 - 1 : CCCGCACATGATGTCTGGCACCAGA ( Kirkegaard et al . , 2010 ) , SMPD1 - 2 : GAGGATCGAGGAGACAAAGTGCATA ( Kirkegaard et al . , 2010 ) , SMPD1 - 3 : CCCAAATGCTGCTGTGGTT , ASAH1 - 1 : TTCAGTGTAAGACTGAACAGTCCTG , ASAH1 - 2 : CTGTTCAGTCTTACACTGA , ABCB1 : GACCATAAATGTAAGGTTT , Non - targeting control - 1 : CGACCGAGACAAGCGCAAG ( Rohde et al . , 2005 ) , and Non - targeting control - 2 : AllStar negative control from Qiagen . RNA isolation , reverse transcription and realtime PCR .
