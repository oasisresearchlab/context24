These cytoskeletal networks , together with various cross - linking and other associated proteins largely determine the ( visco ) elastic response of cells . In this Letter we study a model system of cross - linked , stiff ﬁlaments in order to explore the connection between the microstructure under strain and the macroscopic response of cytoskeletal networks . We ﬁnd two distinct regimes as a function primarily of cross - link density and ﬁlament rigidity : one characterized by afﬁne deformation and one by nonafﬁne deformation . We characterize the crossover between these two . DOI : 10 . 1103 / PhysRevLett . 91 . 108102 PACS numbers : 87 . 16 . Ka , 62 . 20 . Dc , 82 . 35 . Pq The study of biopolymer networks and gels lies at the heart of the understanding of the mechanical properties of the cytoplasm since the mechanical rigidity of the intracellular material is largely governed by the cyto - skeleton , a complex network of ﬁlamentous proteins , cross - links , and other associated proteins [ 1 ] . A key player in this cytoskeleton is F - actin , which exhibits sig - niﬁcant rigidity on the cellular scale . The material prop - erties of such semiﬂexible polymer networks also pose complex and current problems in polymer physics . Many of the most basic questions concerning these common and important networks , such as how they deform under stress , remain unanswered . The bending rigidity of such polymers introduces a new microscopic elastic parameter that can have consequences for the macroscopic elastic coefﬁcients of the bulk , semiﬂexible gel . This changes the traditional rubber elasticity model for the bulk properties of gels composed of cross - linked ﬂexible polymers . In this Letter , we examine a simple model for cross - linked rods that not only allows us to quantitatively test the relationship between the microscopic and macro - scopic elastic coefﬁcients of a randomly cross - linked network , but also sheds light on the intimately related issue of the spatial distribution of the network strain . Among the most fundamental properties of polymer net - works is the way in which they deform under stress . Since the classical theories of rubber elasticity [ 2 ] it has been suggested that this deformation is afﬁne , i . e . , that the strain is uniform , as for a sheared Newtonian ﬂuid at low Reynolds number . While this leads to relatively good agreement with experiments for rubberlike networks , much evidence and continuing efforts concern systematic deviations that point to nonafﬁne network strains at a microscopic scale . The assumption that the deformation ﬁeld is afﬁne down to length scales comparable to the smallest micro - scopic scales in the material is a great simpliﬁcation that allows one to construct quantitative theories relating the macroscopic elastic constants of a gel to the microscopic properties of its constituent polymers . The validity of the afﬁne approximation for this class of semiﬂexible poly - mer materials has , however , been the subject of some debate [ 3 – 5 ] . Whether the deformation ﬁeld is afﬁne or not depends , of course , on length scale ; clearly at the scale of the entire sample , all deformations are trivially afﬁne when subject to simple shear . We explore whether this self - averaging property of the deformation ﬁeld ex - tends to shorter length scales for semiﬂexible networks . We show that the degree of nonafﬁne strain is a function of length scale and degree of cross - linking . Speciﬁcally , we ﬁnd that the range of nonafﬁne strain can extend well beyond the mesh size , or correlation length , the typical separation between ﬁlaments [ 6 ] . This occurs near the point of rigidity percolation for the network , or for highly ﬂexible ﬁlaments . This results in elastic moduli governed primarily by bending of ﬁlaments under nonafﬁne strain , consistent with [ 4 , 5 ] . In contrast , we ﬁnd that these net - works become increasingly afﬁne , even down to the smallest scales of the network , e . g . , the mesh size , at high cross - link density , high molecular weight , or for rigid ﬁlaments . Here , we ﬁnd that the bulk elastic moduli converge to those predicted from afﬁne theory [ 3 ] . We also quantify the degree of nonafﬁne strain and show that this is , indeed , dependent on the length scale . As we focus on the zero - frequency , or static properties of the system we may ignore the complexities of the network - solvent interaction . To isolate the importance of semiﬂexibility upon network properties , we also ignore the complex , nonlinear response of the individual F - actin ﬁlaments [ 3 , 4 , 7 ] . We instead study in detail the depen - dence of the bulk shear modulus and Young’s modulus of the material upon the cross - link density of the polymer gel as well as the bending and extension moduli of the individual ﬁlaments . We model the network ﬁlaments via the Hamilitonian per unit length ( (cid:2)s ) for a ﬁlament (cid:2) H (cid:2)s (cid:1) (cid:4) 2 (cid:1) (cid:2)l (cid:2)s (cid:2) 2 (cid:2) (cid:6) 2 (cid:1) (cid:2)(cid:7) (cid:2)s (cid:2) 2 : ( 1 ) P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending 5 SEPTEMBER 2003 V OLUME 91 , N UMBER 10 108102 - 1 0031 - 9007 = 03 = 91 ( 10 ) = 108102 ( 4 ) $ 20 . 00  2003 The American Physical Society 108102 - 1 The ﬁrst term takes into account the extensional defor - mation of the ﬁlament (cid:2)l (cid:3) s (cid:4) as a function of arc length , s with modulus (cid:4) . The second term determines the energy stored in the ﬁlament due to bending : the local tangent of the ﬁlament makes an angle (cid:7) (cid:3) s (cid:4) with respect to the ^ xx axis and the bending modulus of the ﬁlament is (cid:6) . Note that both of these terms are quadratic . We do not explore nonlinearities , such as buckling when compressed beyond the Euler instability , at the scale of individual ﬁlaments . While such nonlinear effects are expected at increasing strains and ﬁnite temperature [ 3 ] , we seek to understand here the fundamental properties of semiﬂexible networks and thus address only the linearized version of the prob - lem . We note , however , that thermal ﬂuctuations can result in an effective modulus (cid:4) (cid:5) (cid:6) 2 = (cid:3) kTl 3 (cid:4) for a segment of length l . Thus , we consider (cid:4) and (cid:6) to be independent parameters , even though they are both determined by single ﬁlament elastic properties and geometry at T (cid:1) 0 [ 8 ] . Clearly the full exploration of these networks at ﬁnite temperature presents an interesting challenge ; under - standing the T (cid:1) 0 mechanical properties of these net - works , however , is the requisite ﬁrst step towards this more ambitious program . In addition , we will point out speciﬁc aspects of our results that are likely to depend critically on our zero - temperature assumption . After all , it is now understood that for some mechanical properties of networks , the zero temperature presents a singular limit as in the case of rigidity percolation . Real F - actin networks formed from an actin monomer solution have a complex geometry , arising from the dy - namic growth and branching of ﬁlaments [ 1 , 9 ] . For com - putational efﬁciency , we ignore such complications and consider static , isotropic networks of monodisperse ﬁla - ments of length L . Each ﬁlament is represented by a line segment deposited with random position and orientation to a two - dimensional rectangular shear cell . Intersections are identiﬁed as permanent , freely rotating cross - links , to mimic , e . g . , the attachments of double - headed myosin molecules in an ATP - deﬁcient solution [ 10 ] . The mean distance between cross - links is l c as measured along a ﬁlament . Deposition continues until the desired cross - link density L = l c has been reached . The network is represented by the set of mobile nodes f x i g consisting of all cross - links and midpoints between cross - links ( the latter so as to include the dominant bending mode ) . The total system energy H (cid:3)f x i g(cid:4) is then expressed in terms of the f x i g using a discrete version of ( 1 ) . Within our linearized scheme , this H (cid:3)f x i g(cid:4) is a high - dimensional paraboloid with a unique global minimum , corresponding to the state of mechanical equilibrium at T (cid:1) 0 . For the initially unstressed network , this mini - mum corresponds to zero deformation . Depending on whether we wish to measure the shear modulus G or the Young’s modulus Y , a shear or uniaxial strain (cid:18) is applied across the periodic boundaries in a Lees - Edwards man - ner . This moves the global minimum to a new , nontrivial position , which we numerically ﬁnd using the precondi - tioned conjugate gradient method . Examples of stabilized networks are given in Fig . 1 . The stored energy per unit area can then be calculated , which is (cid:18) 2 = 2 times G or Y [ 8 ] within our linear approximation , and hence the net - work modulus can be extracted . This procedure is re - peated for different network realizations until a reliable estimate of G or Y has been attained . Further simulation details can be found in [ 11 ] . Apart from the system size , there are three length scales in the problem : two geometric lengths L and l c , and a third material length scale deriving from the stretching and bending modulii , l b (cid:1) (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3) (cid:6) = (cid:4) p . On dimen - sional grounds , the modulii can be written in the form G (cid:1) (cid:4)L f (cid:3) L ; l c ; l b (cid:4) ( with a similar expression for Y ) , pro - vided that the system size is sufﬁciently large that ﬁnite size effects can be ignored , as applies to all of the results presented here . Results are given in Fig . 2 for the shear modulus G and the Poisson ration (cid:22) (cid:1) 2 Y = G (cid:8) 1 . G monotonically increases with the cross - link density L = l c and the ratio l b = L . Both G and Y simultaneously vanish at the rigid - ity percolation transition (cid:9) L = l c (cid:10) crit (cid:11) 5 : 9 , irrespective of l b . This is consistent with the more precise value (cid:9) L = l c (cid:10) crit (cid:11) 5 : 932 found by Latva - Kokko et al . [ 12 ] using the combinatorial ‘‘pebble game’’ method . We ﬁnd that G and Y scale near the transition as (cid:5)(cid:3) L = l c (cid:8) (cid:9) L = l c (cid:10) crit (cid:4) f with f (cid:1) 3 : 0 (cid:12) 0 : 2 , placing it in a distinct universality class from both central - force rigidity and bond bending without free rotation at cross - links [ 13 ] . The variation of (cid:22) is more subtle if at all , varying from (cid:11) 0 : 5 for high densities to (cid:11) 0 : 35 (cid:12) 0 : 1 near the critical point ( for comparison , standard stability considerations re - quire (cid:8) 1 (cid:13) (cid:22) (cid:13) 1 in 2D ) . Further details of the scaling behavior near the transition will be presented elsewhere [ 11 ] . We remark that at ﬁnite temperatures G will remain nonzero above the conductivity percolation transition at L = l c (cid:11) 5 : 42 , but it is not clear if this small - G behavior is experimentally observable for the macromolecules under consideration here . Away from the critical point , G decreases as the bend - ing modulus (cid:6) decreases . Indeed , in the limit (cid:6) ! 0 , or equivalently l b ! 0 , all ﬁlaments freely bend and the model reduces to a random network of Hookean springs , which is already known to have a vanishing G for all ﬁ - nite cross - link densities [ 14 ] . In the opposite limit l b ! 1 , bending along a ﬁlament’s length becomes prohibitively expensive and response becomes dominated by stretch - ing modes . The same is true of the limit L = l c ! 1 with l b = L ﬁxed , since bending modes of wavelength greater than l c require an area of network to twist rather than a single ﬁlament , and are suppressed . This transition from low L = l c , bending - dominated networks to high L = l c , stretching - dominated ones can be clearly seen Fig . 1 . Pure , afﬁne shear , being a combination of rotation and extension , induces only stretching and compression P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S week ending 5 SEPTEMBER 2003 V OLUME 91 , N UMBER 10 108102 - 2 108102 - 2 of ﬁlaments . Furthermore , networks dominated by stretching modes must be approximately afﬁne . This fol - lows from the observation that , far above the rigidity transition , there can be no orientational disorder without a corresponding cost in bending energy . It is straight - forward to derive analytic expressions for the modulii under an afﬁne strain . A rod of length L lying at an angle (cid:7) to the x axis will undergo a relative change in length (cid:2)L = L (cid:1) (cid:18) xy sin (cid:7) cos (cid:7) in response to an afﬁne strain ﬁeld (cid:18) xy . According to ( 1 ) with (cid:2)(cid:7) (cid:1) 0 , the energy cost ( after uniformly averaging over all angles (cid:7) ) is (cid:2) H (cid:1) (cid:4)L(cid:18) 2 xy = 16 . To calculate G , we need to express the number of rods per unit area N as a function of L and l c . The exact expression is easy to derive , but for current purposes it is sufﬁcient to use the approximate relation L = l c (cid:11) (cid:3) (cid:25) (cid:8) 1 (cid:4) = (cid:3) 1 (cid:8) 2 = (cid:25) (cid:4) with (cid:25) (cid:1) 2 L 2 N = (cid:26) , valid for L = l c (cid:11) 5 and greater ( note that the full expression is monotonic ) . A further correction removes the dangling ends of the rods by renormalizing the rod lengths to L (cid:8) 2 l c . Then using G (cid:1) 2 H = (cid:18) 2 xy , G affine (cid:1) (cid:26) 16 (cid:4) L (cid:1) L l c (cid:2) 2 l c L (cid:8) 3 (cid:2) ; ( 2 ) so that G (cid:5) (cid:3) (cid:26) = 16 (cid:4) (cid:4) = l c as L = l c ! 1 . Expression ( 2 ) is plotted in Fig . 2 and gives a reasonable approximation to the data , with the agreement improving as L = l c increases . The same calculations can be repeated to give Y affine (cid:1) 3 G affine and hence a Poisson ratio (cid:22) affine (cid:1) 0 : 5 , which is also plotted in the ﬁgure . Perhaps surprisingly , we ﬁnd remarkably good agreement between the measured (cid:22) and the afﬁne value , even close to the rigidity transition , where the afﬁne approximation fails . We observe that there is an apparent crossover from a bending - dominated , nonafﬁne regime for either high mo - lecular weight ( L ) or for high density . The natural mea - sure for this is the ratio of ﬁlament length to average distance between cross - links . This can be understood by the fact that , unlike networks of ﬂexible polymers , where segments along a single polymer between cross - links appear to behave as effectively independent network strands , the segments of semiﬂexible ﬁlaments between cross - links act in series . Thus , segments far from free ends are forced to deform nearly afﬁnely by the many constraints on their neighboring segments imposed by cross - links . This suggests a physical picture in which nonafﬁne deformations are primarily associated with less constrained free ends . Let (cid:27) denote the range of such nonafﬁne regions near the ﬁlament ends . We expect this length (cid:27) (cid:3) l c ; l b (cid:4) to be a function of the local density of ﬁlaments ( measured by l c , the distance between cross - links ) and the material length l b . Then , what determines the degree to which the network is afﬁne or not is the Bend Stretch FIG . 1 ( color online ) .

We ﬁnd that , sufﬁciently far above the transition , G = G affine collapses to a single master curve with the empirical choice (cid:27) (cid:1) (cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3)(cid:3) l 4 c = l b 3 p , as shown in Fig . 3 ( the origin of this length scale is discussed elsewhere [ 11 ] ) . This conﬁrms the existence of a fundamental length scale (cid:27) for nonafﬁne deformations along the ﬁlament back - bone , as well as two physically distinct regimes : non - afﬁne behavior for L & (cid:27) and afﬁne behavior for L * (cid:27) . In the ﬁrst of these , we note that the modulus depends only on (cid:6) and not on (cid:4) , signaling a bending - dominated regime , as predicted by Kroy and Frey [ 4 , 15 ] . Similar results have been found independently [ 16 ] . Note that the crossover can be reached at any ﬁxed density by varying l b alone , and thus represents distinct physics from the percolation transition , which exists only at a speciﬁc density . Hence we use absolute density , rather than its value relative to the transition , in our scaling function . Our ﬁndings demonstrate that the degree of afﬁnity of the deformation ﬁeld does depend on the length scale on which one looks . This is shown in Fig . 4 , where the quantity h (cid:22) (cid:7) 2 (cid:3) r (cid:4)i is plotted against r for different values of L = (cid:27) . h (cid:22) (cid:7) 2 (cid:3) r (cid:4)i is the square deviation of the angle of rotation (cid:7) between two points separated by a distance r , relative to the afﬁne equivalent . This monotonically de - creases for increasing r , suggesting that the deformation appears more afﬁne when viewed on larger length scales . Furthermore , the deviation from afﬁnity at the mesh scale r (cid:1) l c is small for networks with G (cid:11) G affine , and large for those with G (cid:18) G affine , as seen by comparing Figs . 3 and 4 . Thus we can reiterate the main ﬁndings of our work : ( i ) there are two qualitatively distinct regimes , one afﬁne and the other nonafﬁne ; ( ii ) the physics of the crossover between these is distinct from the rigidity tran - sition ; and ( iii ) the crossover is governed by a new length scale (cid:27) , where , e . g . , afﬁne behavior is seen for ﬁlament lengths a few times this length . Since this length is expected to be of order the distance between cross - links , real networks can be in either regime depending on the length distribution . A . J .
