The gliding machinery can be divided into 34 surface and internal structures . The internal structure of the motor is composed of 35 28 so - called ' chains ' that are each comprised of 17 repeating protein units called 36 ' particles ' . These proteins include homologs of the catalytic α - and β - subunits of F 1 - 37 ATPase . In this study , we isolated the particles and determined their structures 38 using negative - staining electron microscopy and high - speed atomic force 39 microscopy . The isolated particles were composed of five proteins , MMOBs 1660 40 ( α - subunit homolog ) , 1670 ( β - subunit homolog ) , 1630 , 1620 , and 4530 , and 41 showed ATP hydrolyzing activity . The 2D structure , with dimensions of 35 and 26 42 nm , showed a hexameric ring dimer about 12 nm in diameter , resembling F 1 - 43 ATPase catalytic ( αβ ) 3 . We isolated the F 1 - like ATPase unit , which is composed of 44 MMOBs 1660 , 1670 , and 1630 . Furthermore , we isolated the chain and analyzed 45 the 3D structure , showing that dimers of mushroom - like structures resembling F 1 - 46 ATPase were connected and aligned along the dimer axis at 31 nm intervals . An 47 atomic model of F 1 - ATPase catalytic ( αβ ) 3 from Bacillus PS3 was successfully fitted 48 to each hexameric ring of the mushroom - like structure . These results suggest that 49 the motor for M . mobile gliding shares an evolutionary origin with F 1 - ATPase . 50 Based on the obtained structure , we propose possible force transmission 51 processes in the gliding mechanism . 52 53 4 IMPORTANCE 54 F 1 F o - ATPase , a rotary ATPase , is widespread in the membranes of mitochondria , 55 chloroplasts , and bacteria , and converts ATP energy with a proton motive force 56 across the membrane by its physical rotation . Homologous protein complexes play 57 roles in ion and protein transport . Mycoplasma mobile , a pathogenic bacterium , 58 was recently suggested to have a special motility system evolutionarily derived 59 from F 1 - ATPase . The present study isolated the protein complex from Mycoplasma 60 cells and supported this conclusion by clarifying the detailed structures containing 61 common and novel features as F 1 - ATPase relatives . 62 5 INTRODUCTION 63 Mycoplasmas are parasitic bacteria characterized by small cell size , a short 64 genome and lack of a peptidoglycan layer ( 1 - 3 ) . Many Mycoplasma species exhibit 65 a unique gliding motility , which is necessary for their infection ( 4 - 6 ) . Mycoplasma 66 mobile glides on solid surfaces at 2 . 0 to 4 . 5 µm / s in the direction of a protrusion on 67 one side of the cell ( Fig . S1 ) ( 5 ) . The gliding machinery is localized to the cell 68 protrusion and can be divided into surface and internal structures ( Fig . 1A , upper ) . 69 The surface structure has approximately 450 repeats of a complex of three large 70 proteins , Gli123 , Gli521 , and Gli349 , inserted into the cell membrane ( Fig . 1A , 71 lower ) ( 7 - 11 ) . Fifty - nm - long leg structures corresponding to Gli349 molecules can 72 be seen jutting out from cell protrusion by electron microscopy ( EM ) ( 12 ) . The tip of 73 Gli349 is characterized by a " foot " with an oval structure that can bind to sialylated 74 oligosaccharides ( SOs ) ( 13 - 20 ) . Gli521 and Gli123 serve as the " crank " that 75 transfers force to Gli349 and the " mount " that localizes the other two surface 76 proteins to the gliding machinery , respectively . A working model of the gliding 77 mechanism has been proposed in which the cells are propelled by Gli349 78 molecules that repeatedly catch , pull , and release SOs on solid surfaces ( 5 , 21 - 23 ) . 79 The internal structure consists of a lumpy structure , called “bell” at the tip of the 80 cell protrusion and 28 “chains” lining the inner membrane surface ( Fig . 1A ) ( 23 - 26 ) . 81 Each chain is characterized by 17 repeating particle structures , resulting in a total 82 of 476 particles in one cell . The chains tend to form sheets when they are isolated 83 from cells , suggesting lateral interaction with the adjacent chains ( 23 , 24 ) . The 84 6 internal structure consists of least ten proteins ( Fig . 1B ) . Six of these proteins , 85 MMOBs 1620 , 1630 , 1640 , 1650 , 1660 and 1670 were coded tandemly in a locus . 86 Interestingly , MMOBs 1660 and 1670 , which have Walker A and B motifs that are 87 involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis ( 27 ) , show high amino acid sequence 88 identity with the catalytic subunits α and β of F 1 - ATPase , respectively . MMOB1670 89 has an extra N - terminal region ( amino acids 1 – 299 ) , which is not present in the β 90 subunit . The chains most likely contain the motor for gliding , because the gliding 91 motility is coupled to ATP hydrolysis ( 23 , 28 , 29 ) . 92 F 1 F o - ATPases , found in most organisms , are rotary motors that perform 93 biological energy conversion ( 30 , 31 ) . Their role is to both synthesize ATP using a 94 proton motive force and , conversely , to hydrolyze ATP to drive protons to maintain 95 the membrane potential . Their structure is composed of a soluble catalytic F 1 - 96 domain for ATP catalysis and a membrane - embedded F o - domain for the proton 97 pathway . In the F 1 - domain , the catalytic subunits α and β alternate to form a 98 hexameric ring ( αβ ) 3 that rotates the central stalk penetrating the ring using ATP 99 hydrolysis . Phylogenetic studies have shown that Mycoplasma have three F 1 - like 100 ATPase clusters , which are referred to as Type 1 – 3 ATPases ( 26 , 32 ) . Type 1 , 101 found in all mycoplasmas , is a typical operon encoding F 1 F o - ATPase and is likely to 102 function as a proton pump to maintain membrane potential . Type 3 is found in 103 mycoplasmas that have an MIB - MIP system to cleave host immunoglobulins ( 33 ) . 104 Type 2 is only found in four Mycoplasma species , including M . mobile . Interestingly , 105 the Type 2 ATPase of M . mobile , which encodes MMOB1620 – 70 , is involved in the 106 7 internal structure of the gliding machinery . 107 Recently , the chains of the internal structure were shown to have structural 108 changes linked to ATP hydrolysis . However , it is still unclear how the chain 109 generates and transmits the force to the outside , because its detailed structure has 110 not been clarified . In this study , we isolated the chains and elucidated their 111 structures . The structure had a common architecture with F 1 - ATPase , suggesting 112 that the chain shares a common evolutionary origin with F 1 - ATPase . Based on our 113 findings , we suggest two possible force transmission models for the gliding 114 machinery . 115 116 Results 117 Isolation and biochemical analyses of stable unit complex . In this study , 118 we isolated and analyzed three fractions including “Dimer” , “Monomer” , and 119 “Chain” structures which are schematically shown in Fig . 1A ( Fig . S2 , S3 ) . 120 First , to isolate a stable unit complex from the chain , we lysed cultured M . 121 mobile cells with 1 % Triton X - 100 and recovered the insoluble fraction by 122 centrifugation ( 24 ) . This fraction named as “Pellet - 1” was used for further 123 preparations . We suspended Pellet - 1 in suspension buffer , which contains 137 mM 124 NaCl , and solubilized the putative unit complex for 8 h . Here , we used 137 mM 125 NaCl rather than 400 mM to reduce the contamination of other proteins . The 126 soluble fraction was then subjected to Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatography . 127 8 The obtained peak fraction in the void contained MMOBs 1620 , 1630 , 1660 , and 128 1670 , which are coded on the mycoplasma Type 2 ATPase operon , and 129 MMOB4530 annotated as phosphoglycerate kinase ( PGK ) ( Fig . 2A ) . These 130 proteins are known to be components of the internal structure ( Fig . 1B ) ( 23 - 26 ) . 131 To examine the assembly of these proteins , we applied the isolated fraction to 132 gel filtration chromatography using a Sephacryl S - 400 HR column , which can 133 fractionate up to 8000 kDa globular proteins ( Fig . 2B ) . The proteins eluted as a 134 single peak at a non - void position and were larger than 669 kDa , suggesting that 135 they form a large complex . The molar ratios of the components were estimated to 136 be 3 . 2 : 2 . 9 : 3 . 0 : 1 . 0 : 2 . 3 for MMOBs 1670 , 4530 , 1660 , 1630 , and 1620 , respectively , 137 from the relative intensity of the SDS - PAGE bands . We then analyzed the isolated 138 fraction by blue - native ( BN ) PAGE ( Fig . 2C , left ) . A single band was detected , 139 which is consistent with the result of gel filtration chromatography showing a single 140 peak . Next , we applied the band to an In - gel ATPase activity assay , which detects 141 the activity as a white precipitation of lead caused by released of inorganic 142 phosphate ( Fig . 2C , right ) . The band with the complex showed precipitation , 143 whereas the band with thyroglobulin , the negative control , did not . This result 144 indicates that the isolated complex has ATPase activity . 145 In addition , we assayed the isolated fraction for phosphate release from 146 solution . The complex hydrolyzed ATP at a maximum turnover rate of 0 . 18 147 molecules / s per MMOB1670 subunit , β - subunit paralog with a K m of 74 μM at 25°C 148 ( Fig . 2D ) . The ATPase activity was inhibited by addition of 15 . 4 mM sodium azide , 149 9 an inhibitor to ATPases with Walker A motifs ( 35 ) , with a K m of 108 μM and a 150 maximum turnover rate of 0 . 055 molecules / s . In a previous study , the Triton - 151 insoluble fraction , which included the internal structure , showed ATPase activity 152 with a K m of 66 μM and a maximum turnover rate of 0 . 09 molecules / s and was 153 suppressed by 15 . 4 mM sodium azide , showing a K m of 84 μM and a maximum 154 rate of 0 . 063 molecules / s ( 23 ) . The values obtained here are comparable to these 155 previous data . The above results suggest that the isolated complex is the motor in 156 the internal structure of the gliding machinery . We used this unit complex for further 157 analyses . 158 Hexamers resembling F 1 - ATPase catalytic ( αβ ) 3 form a dimer . We 159 observed the unit complex by EM using the negative - staining method . A field image 160 showed uniform particles with dimensions of 40 and 20 nm ( Fig . 3A and B ) . As the 161 particle frequency depended on the protein concentration , we concluded that the 162 observed particles were a part of the protein complex . We picked 2148 particle 163 images automatically using RELION software ( 36 ) for 2D - classification . From the 164 2D - classification , we obtained four clear particle images ( Fig . S4 ) . We adopted 165 mirror images according to the structure observed in high - speed atomic force 166 microscopy ( HS - AFM ) ( see below ) . Structural handedness cannot be judged from 167 EM images because they are projections of electrons transmitted through the 168 sample . We focused on an image showing a complex structure with dimensions of 169 35 and 26 nm featuring nearly two - fold symmetry ( Fig . 3C and D ) . Interestingly , the 170 characteristic hexamer of about 12 nm in diameter formed a dimer and was 171 10 reminiscent of F 1 - ATPase catalytic ( αβ ) 3 . Considering that the amino acid 172 sequences of MMOBs 1660 and 1670 have high identity to the α - and β - subunits of 173 F 1 - ATPase , respectively , the dimeric complex is likely an evolutionary related F 1 - 174 ATPase . The distance between the centers of the two hexamers was 11 . 0 nm . The 175 complex had ten filamentous structures around the two hexamers , four of which 176 appeared to form bridges across the two hexamers . The filamentous structures are 177 unlikely artifact , because they showed common features in four independent 178 averaged images ( Fig . S4 ) . Hereafter , we refer to this structural unit as “Dimer . ” 179 The hexamer featured a ring and a peak in HS - AFM of Dimer . Next , we 180 visualized Dimer using HS - AFM to clarify the structure under liquid conditions , 181 because the molecules are in dry condition under negative - staining EM . HS - AFM is 182 a powerful method that can visualize the structure and dynamics of single 183 molecules in liquid conditions at a video rate ( 37 , 38 ) . In this method , a specimen is 184 placed on the stage surface and with a probe is scanned in buffer at high speed . In 185 this study , we placed Dimer on a mica surface and scanned it in an area of 70 × 70 186 nm 2 at 56 × 56 pixels with a scanning rate of 100 ms per frame . HS - AFM images 187 showed a complex with dimensions of approximately 30 and 20 nm composed of 188 two globules and attached by 2 – 4 lateral protrusions shorter than 15 nm ( Fig . 3E ; 189 Movie S1 and S2 ) . The Dimer images were categorized into two patterns as either 190 a ring ( pattern I ) or a peak ( pattern II ) , based on the central part . Then , we 191 observed them at a higher resolution ( area , 40 × 40 nm 2 with 50 × 50 pixels ; 192 scanning rate , 100 ms per frame ) ( Fig . 3F ) . In pattern I , the slice image near the 193 11 top end of the particle between 9 . 8 and 11 . 3 nm above the substrate surface 194 showed two hexameric rings ( Fig . 3G ) . The position and direction of the two rings 195 are consistent with those of the hexamers in the negative - staining EM image . In 196 addition , the distance between the centers of the two hexameric rings was 10 . 4 nm 197 ( Fig . 3H ) , consistent with the distance between the centers of the hexamers in the 198 negative - staining EM image ( Fig . 3C ) . These observations suggest that the shape 199 of the Dimer structure in liquid is preserved in negative - staining EM conditions and 200 that the hexamers form rings like F 1 - ATPase catalytic ( αβ ) 3 . In pattern II , the two 201 central peaks were positioned 11 . 2 nm apart ( Fig . 3H , lower ) , similar to the 202 distance between the centers of the hexameric rings in pattern I ( Fig . 3H , upper ) , 203 suggesting that patterns I and II are two sides of the same coin ( Fig . 3E , left ) . 204 Interestingly , in most of the particles , the two peaks at 6 and 5 nm became invisible 205 in 20 s , between frames 1 and 3 ( Fig . 3I and J ; Movie S3 ) . We concluded that 206 these subunits dropped out from the complex , because they did not reappear until 207 the complex was disrupted . Next , we focused on the lateral protrusions of these 208 particles , which may be related to the sheet formation of chains ( 23 ) . To visualize 209 them more clearly , we scanned Dimer by HS - AFM with an area of 120 × 120 nm 2 , 210 120 × 120 pixels , and scanning rate 500 ms per frame . Dimer showed seven lateral 211 protrusions around the two globules ( Fig . 3K ) . These protrusions swayed without 212 being fixed ( Fig . 3L ; Movie S4 ) . 213 Isolation and structure of Monomer . To clarify the components and structure 214 of the hexamer , we focused on the monomeric hexamer , called Monomer ( Fig . S2 ) . 215 12 We treated Dimer fraction with 1 . 5 % sodium cholate , an anionic detergent . BN - 216 PAGE and In - gel ATPase activity assays showed a single band with ATPase 217 activity at a position lower than the original one , corresponding to 720 – 1048 kDa , 218 indicating that Dimer dissociated into smaller units with ATPase activity ( Fig . 2C ) . 219 Therefore , to isolate Monomer , we applied Pellet - 1 sequentially to the treatments 220 with 250 mM NaCl for 8 h , 1 . 5 % sodium cholate for 7 h , and to Sephacryl S - 400HR 221 gel filtration chromatography ( Fig . S2 ) . The elution pattern showed a rather isolated 222 small peak and following overlapping peaks ( Fig . S3C ) . An SDS - PAGE gel showed 223 that MMOBs 1670 , 1660 , and 1630 eluted in the same fractions , while MMOBs 224 4530 and 1620 eluted at later fractions ( Fig . S3CD ) , indicating that MMOBs 4530 225 and 1620 were dissociated from Dimer by sodium cholate treatment . Then , we 226 focused on the small peak fraction , which mainly contained MMOBs 1670 , 1660 , 227 and 1630 ( Fig . 2A , middle , S3D ) . This complex presumably corresponds to the BN - 228 PAGE band showing ATPase activity ( Fig . 2C ) , because only MMOBs 1660 and 229 1670 have the Walker A and Walker B motifs in the Dimer components . EM 230 observation using the negative - staining method showed uniform globular particles 231 10 – 15 nm in diameter ( Fig . 4A and B ) . As the particle frequency depended on the 232 protein concentration , we concluded that the observed particles were a part of 233 Monomer . We picked 11687 particle images automatically using RELION software 234 for 2D - classification . By 2D - classifing the images in 50 classes , we obtained 15 235 clear particle images , which were averaged ( Fig . S5 ) . Fig . 4C shows a 12 nm 236 diameter globule characterized by a single hexameric ring , corresponding to a part 237 13 of the Dimer image in Fig . 3C . Three of the subunits were larger than the others 238 with hook structures on either side of the edge . Three averaged images ( II – IV ) 239 showed a mushroom - like structure resembling F 1 - ATPase , which is characterized 240 by a 12 nm - diameter umbrella and a 3 nm - long stalk ( Fig . 4C ) . Now , we can 241 suggest that MMOBs 1670 , 1660 , and 1630 form Monomer , i . e . , F 1 - like ATPase 242 unit . MMOB4530 was probably not included in this unit because it probably binds 243 to the complex and could not be distinguished in the image due to the low 244 proportion of bound entities ( Fig . 2A , middle ) . Thus , the hexameric ring is likely 245 formed by the α - subunit homolog MMOB1660 and the β - subunit homolog 246 MMOB1670 , and the stalk is formed by MMOB1630 . 247 Isolation and structure of Chain . In gliding machinery , Dimer link to form 248 chains . To characterize these chains , we isolated “Chain fraction” with milder 249 mechanical treatment than those for other fractions . Pellet - 1 was treated by 387 250 mM NaCl and soluble fraction was isolated . Chain fraction contained more than 30 251 proteins , including the Dimer component proteins MMOBs 1670 , 4530 , 1660 , 1630 , 252 and 1620 as major components ( Fig . 2A , right ) . EM observation using the negative - 253 staining method showed chain structures with lengths longer than 70 nm and 254 particles of various sizes ( Fig . 5A and B ) . This time we manually picked 2127 255 particles from the chain images , overlapping approximately 50 % of the 71 × 71 nm 2 256 box area . From 2D - classifcation , we obtained seven clear particle images ( Fig . 257 5C ) . The particle images show the various orientations required for 3D 258 reconstruction . We then created a 3D map by combining a total of 1709 particle 259 14 images of good quality ( Fig . 5D and S6 ) . The 3D map with dimensions of 70 , 20 , 260 and 15 nm at a density threshold ( contour level = 0 . 026 ) was composed of two 261 dimers of mushroom - like structures resembling F 1 - ATPase , aligned along the dimer 262 axis ( Fig . 5D ) . Dimers were connected by a bulge structure with a diameter of 5 263 nm . The chain interval was 31 nm , consistent with the corresponding dimension in 264 a 2D image from electron cryotomography ( ECT ) ( 23 ) , suggesting that the 3D 265 model obtained reflects the original structure from a cell . The mushroom - like 266 structure with a diameter of 15 nm , consisting of a hexameric ring and a central 267 stalk , was connected to the dimer by two bridge structures with a diameter of 3 – 6 268 nm . An atomic model of F 1 - ATPase catalytic ( αβ ) 3 from Bacillus PS3 ( PDB ID 269 6N2Y ) ( 39 ) was fitted into each hexameric ring of the mushroom - like structure ( Fig . 270 5E ) . The distance between the centers of the fitted ( αβ ) 3 in Dimer was 12 . 5 nm , 271 which is consistent with that of Dimer observed by negative - staining EM and HS - 272 AFM ( Fig . 3C and H ) . The fitted model showed that each hexameric ring had two 273 protrusions of 3 – 6 nm pointing laterally ( Fig . 5E ) . The cross - sections of each 274 mushroom - like structure showed the central stalk length of 5 nm ( Fig . 5F ) . A cavity 275 was observed at the center of the hexameric ring . However , it may be an artifact of 276 the low - resolution map of negative - staining EM , because metal coating tends to 277 emphasize the peripheral part of large particles ( 40 ) . Next , we compared a 278 reprojection image of the 3D chain map with the 2D averaged image of Dimer from 279 negative - staining EM ( Fig . 5G ) . Two short filaments marked by asterisks in Dimer 280 ( Fig . 5G , left ) are positioned facing each other in the connecting bulge ( Fig . 5G ) . 281 15 Previously , ECT of a permeabilized M . mobile cell showed a chain structure 282 characterized by repeats of two globules and two types of projections to the cell 283 membrane ( Fig . 5H , left ) ( 23 ) . The hexameric ring and the central stalk in the 3D 284 map here correspond to the globule and one type of projection to the cell 285 membrane in the ECT image , respectively , suggesting that the chain is oriented 286 with the central stalk facing the membrane , which is common in F 1 - ATPases . At the 287 interface between Dimers , the 3D map here did not include a structure composed 288 of another type of projection and a globule as observed in the ECT image . The 289 subunits corresponding to these structures probably had structural variations or 290 dissociation during the isolation process . 291 292 Discussion 293 Outline of internal structure of gliding machinery . Previously , sequence 294 analysis suggested that the chain of M . mobile gliding machinery evolved from F 1 - 295 ATPase ( 5 , 23 - 26 ) . The present study supports this conclusion by structural data 296 showing that the chain has hexameric rings similar to the F 1 - ATPase catalytic ( αβ ) 3 . 297 Integrating available information , we can now describe the outline of the internal 298 structure of the M . mobile gliding machinery ( Fig . 1A ) . M . mobile cells have 28 299 individual 530 nm long chains , each of which contains 17 Dimer units composed of 300 two F 1 - like ATPases and filamentous structures ( 23 ) . The central stalk of the F 1 - like 301 ATPase and another protrusion from the connecting bulge project to the cell 302 16 membrane . 303 Unique role of F 1 - ATPase related complex . To date , several complexes are 304 known to be evolutionarily related to F 1 - ATPase , all of which are responsible for 305 transporting substances across the membrane ( 41 ) . However , the motor we 306 identified here most likely plays a role in motility . This case may be reminiscent of 307 dynein , a motor in eukaryotes , which evolved from a widely conserved AAA 308 ( ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities ) + protein , in which multiple 309 subunits of ATPases perform functional rotation ( 42 , 43 ) . Sequence analyses have 310 shown that mycoplasma Type 3 ATPase is also related to F 1 - ATPase , and its role 311 has been suggested to promote substrate turnover in the MIB - MIP system ( 33 ) . If 312 Type 3 ATPase provides the force to change the conformation of a hydrolytic 313 enzyme , its role in force generation is common with Type 2 , the gliding motor . 314 F 1 F o - ATPases are known to be dimerized through interactions between F o - 315 domains and are usually arranged in rows along the short axis in the tightly curved 316 cristae ridges of mitochondria ( 31 , 44 , 45 ) . The dimer structure found in the present 317 study is not related to this , because the F 1 - like domain is dimerized through the 318 filament structure and is linked in the long axis direction . However , some roles may 319 be common in part if the dimerization and chain formation observed in the gliding 320 motor identified in this study stabilizes the membrane structure , as seen in the 321 F 1 F o - ATPase dimer ( 46 ) . Moreover , dimerization may result in cooperativity in 322 motor functions . 323 Protein assignment . The α - subunit homolog MMOB1660 ( 58 . 7 kDa ) and the β - 324 17 subunit homolog MMOB1670 ( 88 . 4 kDa ) likely correspond to the smaller and larger 325 subunits , respectively , of the hexameric ring of an F 1 - like ATPase unit , as 326 suggested by the estimated 1 : 1 molar ratio in Dimer ( Fig . 2A , 4C ) . This means that 327 the hook structure of the larger subunit may be formed by the extra N - terminal 328 region ( 34 . 8 kDa ) of MMOB1670 . Previously , 3D structure modeling based on 329 secondary structure suggested that MMOB1630 is structurally similar to the γ 330 subunit , the principal component of the central stalk of F 1 - ATPase ( 5 ) . In general , 331 the γ subunit of F 1 - ATPase is composed of a coiled - coil and a globular domain and 332 penetrates the hexameric ring ( 47 ) . In the F 1 - like ATPase unit and chain 3D model , 333 a stalk structure , suggesting the globular domain of the γ subunit , was found in the 334 center of the hexameric ring ( Fig . 4C and 5F ) , implying that MMOB1630 penetrates 335 the hexameric ring like the γ subunit . 336 Using HS - AFM observations , the peak at approximately 5 nm at the center of the 337 hexameric ring dropped out with time ( Fig . 3I ) . The peak height agrees with the 338 length of the estimated globular domain of MMOB1630 in Chain 3D model ( Fig . 3J 339 and 5F ) , suggesting that the peak is composed of MMOB1630 and was pulled out 340 from the hexameric ring by the scanning cantilever during HS - AFM observation . 341 The pull - out event is thought to be common to that of the F 1 - ATPase , in which the γ 342 subunit is removed from the hexameric ring by optical tweezers ( 48 ) . The 343 filamentous structures around the hexameric ring probably correspond to lateral 344 protrusions in the HS - AFM images and are formed by the remaining proteins , 345 MMOB1620 and MMOB4530 ( PGK ) . These proteins probably play roles in ATPase 346 18 dimerization , chain formation , and lateral chain interaction ( 23 ) . MMOB1620 is an 347 unannotated protein specific to the Type 2 ATPase cluster ( 26 , 32 ) . MMOB4530 is 348 annotated as an enzyme that transfers phosphate groups from 1 , 3 - 349 bisphosphoglycerate to ADP in glycolysis to yield ATP and 3 - phosphoglycerate 350 ( 49 ) . In M . mobile , ATP is probably provided by glycolysis ( 50 ) . MMOB4530 may 351 supply ATP efficiently to the gliding motor by its close proximity . Yeast V - ATPase , 352 which belongs to the rotary ATPase family like F 1 F o - ATPase , is also attached by 353 two glycolytic enzymes , 6 - phosphofructo - 1 - kinase and aldolase ( 51 - 53 ) . These 354 glycolytic enzymes are involved in the regulation of V - ATPase assembly and 355 activity . 356 Ten proteins have been identified as the components of the internal structure 357 ( Fig . 1 ) ( 23 , 24 , 26 ) . In the present study , we identified five proteins as the Dimer 358 components . Other five proteins are likely involved in other parts , for example “bell” 359 at the front part of internal structure ( Fig . 1A ) and parts of the intact chain structure 360 which were lost in the fractionation ( Fig . 5H ) . 361 Possible force transmission mechanisms for gliding . The involvement of an 362 internal ATPase in the gliding mechanism is based on the following five 363 observations from the analysis of the " gliding head” of M . mobile protrusions and of 364 the isolated gliding machinery : ( a ) The affinity for ATP estimated by the saturation 365 extent is comparable in the ATPase activity of the internal structure and the speed 366 of the gliding head ( 23 ) . ( b ) Substrate binding and gliding speed of the gliding head 367 are inhibited by azide , as well as the ATPase activity of the internal structure ( 23 ) . 368 19 ( c ) The chain in the internal structure undergoes conformational changes based on 369 ATP hydrolysis ( 23 , 34 ) . ( d ) Among the 21 proteins identified from the gliding head , 370 only MMOBs 1660 and 1670 could be suggested for ATPase from the amino acid 371 sequences alone ( 23 , 24 ) . ( e ) Fluorescent protein tagging of components of the 372 internal structure significantly affects the substrate binding of cell and the gliding 373 speed ( 26 ) . 374 The structure elucidated in the present study allows us to discuss the gliding 375 mechanism in more detail . In F 1 - ATPase , the three catalytic sites in the hexameric 376 ring cooperatively hydrolyze ATP , and each catalytic β - subunit undergoes a 377 conformational change that drives the rotation of the central stalk ( 47 ) . Previously , 378 structural changes linked to ATP hydrolysis were reported : ( I ) EM studies showed 2 379 nm contraction of Dimer intervals in the isolated chains ( 23 ) , and ( II ) HS - AFM 380 studies showed movements of individual Dimers in the cell 9 nm perpendicular to 381 the chain long axis and 2 nm into the cell ( 34 ) . Considering these observations , we 382 propose two different working models for the force transmission mechanism in 383 gliding ( Fig . 6 ) . In the “contraction model” ( Fig . 6 i ) , the force generated by the 384 hexameric ring shortens the chain . The resulting displacement of the projections 385 from Dimer to the cell membrane drives the hook structure of Gli521 like a " lever . ” 386 Then , the leg moves with the catch , pull , and release of the SOs . In the “rotation 387 model” ( Fig . 6 ii ) , the force generated by the hexameric ring rotates MMOB1630 in 388 the same way as F 1 - ATPase . This rotation is transmitted across the cell membrane 389 to the Gli521 . The hook structure converts rotational motion into linear motion of 390 20 the leg , similar to a crank . Previous studies have reported that M . mobile exhibits 391 unitary steps of approximately 70 nm in size at no load ( 29 , 54 ) . In our models , 392 both the rotation and contraction displacements are expected to be a few 393 nanometers . These displacements may be amplified by the large surface structure 394 complex formed by the 100 nm long Gli349 and 120 nm long Gli521 , which show 395 dimensions comparable to the step size , acting as a large gear ( 22 ) . This 396 conjecture could explain how a single leg exerts a force of 1 . 5 pN , smaller than that 397 of conventional motor proteins such as myosin , dynein , and kinesin . 398 Evolution of M . mobile gliding . A previous study suggested that Gli349 evolved 399 from a static binding receptor to parasitize the host ( 16 ) . Considering this , the 400 evolutionary origin of M . mobile gliding can now be discussed . F 1 F o - ATPase , which 401 is abundant on the cell membrane , could have been accidentally associated with 402 the binding receptor and turned into a primitive motility system , which may have 403 provided random cell spreading . The system was then refined under survival 404 pressure , because motility might be beneficial to infection and evading the host ' s 405 immune system . For dimerization and chain formation , PGK was then incorporated 406 into the gliding machinery , because PGK was working in close proximity to F 1 F o - 407 ATPase . 408 409 Materials and Methods 410 Strains and culture conditions . We used P476R gli521 , a mutant strain of M . 411 mobile that can glide normally but binds SOs more tightly than wild - type strains 412 21 ( 10 , 22 , 28 ) . M . mobile cells were cultured as described previously ( 55 , 56 ) . 413 Optical microscopy . The cultured cells were inserted into a tunnel chamber 414 assembled with two coverslips and double - sided tapes and observed by phase - 415 contrast microscopy using an inverted microscope ( IX71 ; Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) 416 ( 17 , 19 ) . Movement was recorded using a complementary metal - oxide 417 semiconductor ( CMOS ) camera ( DMK33UX174 ; The Imaging Source , Bremen , 418 Germany ) . Video was analyzed using the ImageJ software , version 1 . 53a 419 ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / ) . 420 Solubility test . All procedures for fractionation were performed at 4°C unless 421 otherwise noted and focused protein bands were identified by peptide mass 422 fingerprinting ( PMF ) , as previously reported ( 24 , 57 ) . To investigate the solubility of 423 the chain components , M . mobile cells from 60 mL of culture medium were 424 collected by centrifugation at 14000 × g for 20 min and washed twice with PBS 425 consisting of 8 . 1 mM Na 2 HPO 4 , 1 . 5 mM KH 2 PO 4 , pH 7 . 3 , 2 . 7 mM KCl and 137 mM 426 NaCl . Cells were resuspended in PBS to a 12 - fold higher concentration than the 427 culture and sonicated for 1 min at 24 – 27°C to be dispersed in microtubes using an 428 ultrasonic generator ( 2510 J - MT ; BRANSON , Kanagawa , Japan ) . The cells were 429 then treated with Triton solution ( 1 % Triton X - 100 , 0 . 1 mg / mL DNase , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 430 and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in PBS ) in a total volume of 10 mL . After 431 gentle shaking for 1 h , the suspensions were centrifuged at 20000 × g for 20 min , 432 and pellets were collected and washed once with suspension buffer ( PBS including 433 5 mM MgCl 2 ) . This fraction is Pellet - 1 . Pellet - 1 was then resuspended separately in 434 22 suspension buffer adjusted to contain different concentrations of NaCl ( 0 , 50 , 137 , 435 200 , and 400 mM ) by pipetting several times . After treatment for 8 h , suspensions 436 were centrifuged at 20000 × g for 20 min , and supernatants and pellets collected 437 for SDS - PAGE analysis . 438 Preparation of fractions . For isolation of Dimer , Pellet - 1 from 1 . 2 - liter culture 439 was resuspended in 5 mL suspension buffer by pipetting up and down and allowed 440 to dissolve for 8 h . The soluble fraction was collected by centrifugation at 20000 × 441 g for 20 min and loaded onto a HiLoad 16 / 600 Superdex 200 column ( Cytiva , 442 Tokyo , Japan ) equilibrated with 1 mM MgCl 2 in PBS at a flow rate of 0 . 8 mL / min . 443 The fractions were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and CBB staining . 444 For isolation of Monomer , Pellet - 1 from 1 . 2 - liter culture was suspended by 5 445 mL Tris buffer consisting of 20 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 250 mM NaCl , 1 mM 446 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , and 1 mM MgCl 2 with pipetting and allowed to 447 dissolve for 8 h . The soluble fraction was collected by centrifugation at 20000 × g 448 for 20 min and mixed with 1 . 5 % ( w / v ) sodium cholate . After 7 h of incubation , the 449 complexes were loaded onto a Sephacryl S - 400 HR column ( Cytiva ) equilibrated 450 with 0 . 7 % sodium cholate , 20 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 250 mM NaCl , and 1 mM 451 MgCl 2 at a flow rate of 0 . 5 mL / min . The fractions were analyzed by SDS - PAGE and 452 CBB - and reverse - staining ( 58 , 59 ) . The fraction of the complex composed of 453 MMOBs 1670 , 1660 , and 1630 was collected . Samples were concentrated using 454 an Amicon Ultra 100 K spin filter ( Merck KGaA , Darmstadt , Germany ) , if necessary . 455 For isolation of Chain , Pellet - 1 from 15 mL culture was resuspended in 60 μL 456 23 suspension buffer . The suspension was then gently mixed with an equal volume in 457 a suspension buffer adjusted to contain 637 mM NaCl . Chain was recovered as the 458 supernatant by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min . 459 Analytical gel filtration . Dimer solution was loaded onto a Sephacryl S - 400 460 HR column equilibrated with gel filtration buffer containing 20 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 461 7 . 5 ) , 200 mM NaCl and 1 mM MgCl 2 at a flow rate of 0 . 5 mL / min at 4°C . 462 Thyroglobulin ( 669 kDa ; Gel Filtration Calibration Kits ; Cytiva ) was dissolved in gel 463 filtration buffer and loaded onto the column as a size standard at a flow rate of 0 . 5 464 mL / min . The stoichiometry of protein complexes was estimated by densitometry of 465 SDS - PAGE gels stained with CBB , using a scanner ( GT - 9800F ; Epson , Nagano , 466 Japan ) and ImageJ ( 9 ) . 467 BN - PAGE and in - gel ATPase activity assays BN - PAGE was performed 468 according to the user manual of the Native PAGE Novex Bis - Tris Gel System 469 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) . For BN - PAGE of sodium cholate treated 470 Dimer , SC treated , Dimer fraction was mixed with sodium cholate ( 1 . 5 % ) and 471 incubated at 4°C for 9 h . When this sample was mixed with a sample buffer , 472 NativePAGE™ 5 % ( w / v ) G - 250 sample additive was also added at 0 . 5 % ( w / v ) to 473 prevent protein aggregation . Thyroglobulin was dissolved in water and used as a 474 negative control for the In - gel ATPase activity assay . For the In - gel ATPase activity 475 assay ( 60 , 61 ) , native gels were incubated with gentle shaking for 8h at 24 – 27°C in 476 activity buffer containing 270 mM glycine , 35 mM Tris ( pH 8 . 4 ) , 4 mM ATP , 14 mM 477 MgSO 4 , and 0 . 2 % ( w / v ) Pb ( NO 3 ) 2 . The gels were rinsed once with water and 478 24 images were taken using ImageQuant LAS 4000 mini ( Cytiva ) . White precipitates 479 were then dissolved by gentle shaking for 8 h at 24 – 27°C with 50 % ( v / v ) methanol 480 and 10 % ( v / v ) acetic acid in water . The gels were restained with 0 . 025 % ( w / v ) CBB 481 G - 250 and 10 % acetic acid in water for 80 min at 24 – 27°C with gentle shaking and 482 destained with 10 % ( v / v ) ethanol and 10 % acetic acid in water for 180 min at 24 – 483 27°C with gentle shaking . The gels were rinsed once with water and images were 484 taken using ImageQuant LAS 4000 mini . 485 Phosphate - release assay Dimer solution was dialyzed for 8 h using 20 mM 486 Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 150 mM NaCl , and 2 mM MgCl 2 . ATPase activity was assayed 487 by a continuous spectrophotometric method using a 2 - amino - 6 - mercapto - 7 - 488 methylpurine ribonucleoside – purine nucleoside phosphorylase reaction to detect 489 released inorganic phosphate ( EnzChek kit ; Thermo Fisher Scientific ) ( 62 ) . The 490 reaction mixture was as follows : 15 . 7 nM Dimer , 20 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 150 mM 491 NaCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 and 0 . 01 – 1 mM ATP in a total volume of 0 . 2 mL at 25°C . 492 Sodium azide was added to 15 . 4 mM final concentration when the reaction was 493 started . The protein amount of the MMOB1670 comprising F 1 - ATPase β - subunit 494 paralogs was estimated using densitometric of SDS - PAGE . 495 Negative - staining EM and image processing . Dimer solution was placed on 496 a glow - discharged ( PIB - 10 ; VACUUM DEVICE , Ibaraki , Japan ) carbon - coated grid 497 ( F - 400 ; Nisshin EM Co . , Tokyo , Japan ) and incubated for 1 min at 24 – 27°C . The 498 solution was then removed , and the grid was stained with 2 % uranyl acetate ( w / v ) 499 for 30 s . The stain was then removed , and the grid was air - dried . To observe 500 25 Monomer and Chain , the grids were washed with water after 1 min of incubation 501 and then treated as described for Dimer solution . Samples were observed using a 502 transmission EM ( JEM1010 , JEOL ) at 80 kV , equipped with a FastScan - F214 ( T ) 503 charge - coupled - device ( CCD ) camera ( TVIPS , Gauting , Germany ) , and images 504 were captured at 2 . 58 Å / pix . 505 The contrast transfer function parameters for electron micrographs were 506 estimated using Gctf ( 63 ) . Further image processing was performed using RELION 507 3 . 0 ( 36 ) . A total of 2148 particles for Dimer and 11687 particles for Monomer were 508 automatically selected with box sizes of 180 × 180 and 100 × 100 pixels using 509 reference - based auto - picking , respectively . These particle images were binned to 510 5 . 16 Å / pix . For Dimer , the particle images were 2D - classified into 100 classes . For 511 Monomer , particle images were 2D - classified in four rounds , and the selected 7381 512 particles were re - extracted with the pixel size returned to the unbinned image and 513 then 2D - classified into 50 classes . 514 For reconstruction of the 3D chain structure , 2127 particles were manually 515 selected for chains with a box size of 276 × 276 pixels with ~ 50 % overlap . These 516 particle images were binned to 5 . 16 Å / pix . Particle images were 2D - classified in 517 two rounds , and the selected 1709 particles were used to reconstruct the initial 518 model with a final resolution limit of 50 Å . The initial model and selected particles 519 were used to perform 3D refinement . Reprojection images were produced from the 520 3D map using the relion _ project command in RELION . The 3D map was visualized 521 using UCSF Chimera 1 . 14 ( 64 ) . Atomic models of F 1 - ATPase catalytic ( αβ ) 3 from B . 522 26 subtilis ( PDB ID 6N2Y ) ( 39 ) were fitted into the 3D map using command of “Fit in 523 map” in UCSF Chimera . 524 HS - AFM . Imaging was performed with a laboratory - built tapping mode HS - 525 AFM ( 65 , 66 ) , using small cantilevers ( BLAC10DS - A2 , Olympus ; resonant 526 frequency , ~ 0 . 5 MHz in water ; quality factor , ~ 1 . 5 in water ; spring constant , ~ 0 . 1 527 N / m ) . The cantilever’s free - oscillation peak - to - peak amplitude ( A 0 ) and set - point 528 amplitude were set at ~ 2 . 5 nm and ~ 0 . 8 × A 0 , respectively . The probe tip was 529 grown on the original tip end of a cantilever through electron beam deposition and 530 further sharpened using a radio frequency plasma etcher ( PE - 2000 , South Bay 531 Technology , Redondo Beach , CA ) under an argon gas atmosphere ( typically at 180 532 mTorr and 15 W for 3 min ) . The sample was deposited on a freshly cleaved mica 533 disc glued to a glass stage beforehand . After 3 . 5 min , the stage surface was 534 immersed in a liquid cell containing an observation buffer [ 20 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 535 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 ] . Imaging was performed at 24 – 27°C . AFM images were 536 processed using a low - pass filter to remove spike noise and make the xy - plane flat 537 and analyzed using Kodec software ( version 4 . 4 . 7 . 39 ) ( 67 ) . Surface profiles and 538 smoothing were performed using ImageJ software . 539 540 Acknowledgments 541 We thank Toshiaki Arata , Ikuko Fujiwara , Kohei Kobayashi , and Hiroki Sato at the 542 Graduate School of Science , Osaka City University , and Takayuki Uchihashi at the 543 27 Department of Physics and Structural Biology Research Center , Nagoya University , 544 for helpful discussions .
