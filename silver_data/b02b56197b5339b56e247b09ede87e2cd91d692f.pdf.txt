Evidence acquisition : A literature search was performed using all sources ( MEDLINE , EMBASE , ScienceDirect , Cochrane Libraries , and Web of Science ) . As of March 31 , 2020 , the Center for Disease Control reported that of the adults hospitalized for COVID - 19 with underlying conditions in the USA , 74 . 8 % had chronic renal disease . Evidence synthesis : Evidence is discussed from epidemiological studies on SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic and molecular studies on the role of kidney in facilitating routes for SARS - CoV - 2 entry , leading to increased virulence of SARS - CoV - 2 and clinical manifestation of symptoms in RCC . Conclusions : This analysis will advance our understanding of ( 1 ) the molecular signa - tures shared by RCC and COVID - 19 and ( 2 ) the clinical implications of overlapping signaling pathways in the therapeutic management of RCC and COVID - 19 patients .

By the beginning of 12 February 2020 , The World Health Organization ( WHO ) for - 13 mally named the disease triggered by 2019 - nCoV as coro - 14 navirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) . The Internal Committee of 15 Taxonomy of Viruses then named the disease severe respi - 16 ratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , another 17 b - coronavirus cluster related to severe acute respiratory 18 syndrome ( SARS ) of 2003 and Middle East respiratory syn - 19 drome ( MERS ) of 2012 [ 1 , 2 ] . As of April 7 , 2020 , the global 20 pandemic had caused over 1 . 2 million cases and 72 21 000 deaths , with numbers rising each day [ 3 ] . 22 While investigations are intensified as to the mecha - 23 nisms of viral infectivity , person - to - person transmission 24 of the virus includes droplet inhalation transmission and 25 contact transmission through oral , nasal , and eye mucous 26 membrane contacts [ 4 ] . Symptoms of virulence varies 27 depending on the patient but often includes fever and 28 dry cough , while others suffer from fatigue , dyspnea , nasal 29 congestion , nausea , or diarrhea [ 5 ] . Cases can worsen and 30 lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) or 31 pneumonia . However , diagnosis is often complicated by a 32 large portion of patients who are asymptomatic [ 6 ] . Those 33 with pre - existing conditions , such as diabetes , hyperten - 34 sion , and pulmonary , cardiac , and kidney diseases are con - 35 sidered to be at a higher risk of developing severe disease 36 [ 4 , 7 – 10 ] . Owing to the immense burden of the disease on 37 the health , livelihood , and economics of the global popula - 38 tion , it is crucial to consider the molecular aspects of the 39 virus , its functional interaction with host cellular signaling , 40 its association with certain comorbidities , and potential 41 therapeutic strategies for the treatment of COVID - 19 . As millions of cancer patients are fighting COVID - 19 , 42 investigations into the incidence and clinical management 43 of COVID - 19 in patients with cancer , including renal cell 44 carcinoma ( RCC ) , are ongoing with intensity . This reviewaims 45 to advance the current understanding of the impact of angio - 46 tensin - converting enzyme - 2 ( ACE2 ) - mediated SARS - CoV - 2 47 infection on kidney function and the therapeutic targeting of 48 underlying shared mechanisms of RCC and COVID - 19 . 49 2 . Evidence acquisition 50 A literature search was performed using all sources ( MED - 51 LINE , EMBASE , ScienceDirect , Cochrane Libraries , and Web 52 of Science ) . As of March 31 , 2020 , the Center for Disease 53 Control ( CDC ) reported that , of the adults hospitalized for 54 COVID - 19 with underlying conditions in the USA , 74 . 8 % had 55 chronic renal disease . 56 3 . Evidence synthesis 57 3 . 1 . Mechanisms of SARS - CoV - 2 infection The novel zoonotic coronavirus ( CoV ) SARS - CoV - 2 belongs to 58 the subfamily Coronavirinae and genus Betacoronavirus . The 59 30 kb genome of SARS - CoV - 2 is a single - stranded positive - 60 strand RNA ( + ssRNA ; Fig . 1 ) . Sixteen nonstructural proteins 61 ( NSPs ; NSP1 – 16 ) derived from pp1a / pp1ab play specific roles 62 in the replication of CoVs and in the formation of replication - 63 transcription complex that facilitates synthesis of minus - 64 strand messenger RNA called subgenomic RNAs ( sgRNAs ; 65 Fig . 1 ) . While NSPs are conserved among CoVs , there is 66 diversity between structural proteins of CoVs , implicating 67 their functional contribution to the infectivity , adaptation , 68 and transmission . Based on phylogenetic and genomic anal - 69 ysis of the Betacoronavirus clusters , the SARS - CoV - 2 is closely 70 related to the b - coronaviruses bat - SL - CoV ZC45 and bat - SL - 71 CoV ZXC2 , and can cause infection of lower respiratory track 72 and pneumonia in humans . 73 Structural Spike ( S ) proteins drive the entry of the CoVs 74 SARS - CoV and SARS - CoV - 2 into target host cells by engag - 75 ing the cellular receptor ACE2 . Analogous to SAR - CoV infec - 76 tion , interaction of the S protein of SARS - CoV - 2 with cellular 77 ACE2 facilitates the attachment of the virus to target cells 78 [ 11 ] . This step is also functionally associated with the acti - 79 vation of cellular TMPRSS2 , a type - II transmembrane serine 80 protease that drives the entry of virus into the target cell 81 and is regulated by androgens ( Fig . 2 ) . SARS - CoV infection is 82 dependent on the proteolytic activity of TMPRSS2 and 83 results in cleavage of SARS S protein at multiple sites 84 [ 12 ] . Proteolytic cleavage of SARS S protein by TMPRSS2 , 85 known as S priming , mediates efficient virus - host cell 86 fusion and decreases virus sensitivity to neutralizing anti - 87 bodies [ 13 ] . 88 The ACE2 enzyme plays an important role in the renin - 89 angiotensin system ( RAS ) , as it counteracts the effects of 90 angiotensin ( Ang ) II , a vasoactive peptide responsible for 91 vasoconstriction and aldosterone release systemically . Ang I 92 is converted to Ang II by ACE . However , ACE2 depletes Ang I 93 and II levels by directly catalyzing the compounds and 94 converting Ang I to Ang 1 – 9 and Ang II to Ang 1 – 7 , known 95 vasodilators acting through receptor Mas ( MasR ) with anti - 96 fibrotic , antiproliferative , and anti - inflammatory effects 97 [ 7 , 14 – 18 ] . Angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors 98 ( ACEis ) , which block the conversion of Ang I to Ang II , 99 and angiotensin receptor blockers ( ARBs ) , which block 100 the downstream interaction of Ang II with the Ang II type 101 I ( AT 1 ) receptor , are used to treat hypertension and other 102 cardiovascular diseases [ 19 ] . While these treatments do not 103 directly modulate ACE2 , they cause an increase in ACE2 104 expression [ 20 ] . Other medications , such as thiazolidine - 105 diones and ibuprofen , are speculated to increase ACE2 levels 106 also [ 21 ] . Further , ACE2 levels are elevated in patients with 107 multiple cardiovascular conditions , diabetes , and hyperten - 108 sion , those who are at a greater risk of mortality in COVID - 109 19 [ 15 , 21 , 22 ] . Thus , RAS inhibition may affect COVID - 19 110 outcomes by decreasing the proinflammatory activity of 111 Ang II or increasing the virulence of the virus in the heart 112 and lungs due to the increased ACE2 expression [ 10 ] . 113 Both ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are coexpressed on ciliated 114 bronchial epithelial cells and type II pneumocytes , epithelia 115 of small intestine , and podocytes and the border of proximal 116 tubule cells of the kidney , thus making these organ sites 117 easy routes for SARS - CoV and SARS - CoV - 2 infection [ 23 ] .

COVID - 19 and Kidney Disease : Molecular Determinants and Clinical Implications in Renal Cancer . Eur Urol Focus ( 2020 ) , https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . euf . 2020 . 06 . 002 118 particular , ACE2 expression is higher in the kidneys than in 119 any other organ , with potentially 100 times higher expres - 120 sion than in the lungs [ 24 ] . Podocytes and proximal straight 121 tubule cells of the kidney share similar homology and have 122 highly enriched signatures for kidney disease – related sig - 123 naling pathways [ 23 ] . It is therefore of critical importance to 124 investigate the effects of SARS - CoV - 2 on patients with prior 125 kidney issues as well as assess the potential risk of devel - 126 oping kidney injury once infected with COVID - 19 . 127 3 . 2 . Epidemiology of COVID - 19 and cancer 128 The COVID - 19 pandemic created unique circumstances and 129 challenges for cancer patients , including patients with renal 130 cancer and their clinical providers across the clinical care 131 continuum and management trajectory ( ie , cancer diagno - 132 sis , treatment , follow - up care , end of life ) . Epidemiological 133 evidence so far indicates that cancer patients have a higher 134 risk of contracting COVID - 19 , developing complications , 135 and deteriorating more rapidly [ 25 ] . Specifically , the mor - 136 tality rate is significantly higher among SARS - CoV - 2 – 137 infected patients with active cancer ( 28 . 6 % ) than in patients 138 with other comorbidities . Older cancer survivors are more 139 vulnerable to COVID - 19 because of existing chronic , comor - 140 bid health conditions ( diabetes , cardiovascular diseases , 141 and respiratory diseases ) [ 26 ] . Cancer patients presenting 142 at clinics and hospitals for cancer care might have increased 143 exposure to other infected patients and clinical care per - 144 sonnel , leading to increased risk of COVID - 19 , morbidity , 145 and mortality . 146 To reduce cancer patients ’ risk of exposure , difficult 147 clinical decisions have to be made by physicians about 148 for whom , how , and when to provide cancer treatment 149 and follow - up care [ 27 ] . However , delays in cancer Fig . 1 – The SARS - CoV - 2 genome . The 30 kb genome of 2019 - nCOV is a single - stranded positive - strand RNA ( + ssRNA ) . Only one - third of the genome serves as a template for four structural proteins that are functionally involved in the infection process . The four structural proteins include the membrane ( M ) , spike ( S ) , envelope ( E ) , and nucleocapsid ( N ) ; all accessory proteins are derived from sgRNA and are critical for infection . 2019 - nCOV = 2019 novel coronavirus ; SARS - CoV - 2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ; sgRNA = subgenomic RNA . Fig . 2 – Molecular pathway of SARS - CoV - 2 activation in host cells . Mechanism of docking and internalization of SARS - CoV - 2 into host cells are facilitated by host cellular proteins . Docking and host cell entry of SARs - CoV - 2 occur via virion - associated “ spike protein ” recognition and binding with the ACE2 receptor ( 1 ) . Receptor recognition and ACE2 activation are assisted by transmembrane protein TMPRSS2 ( 2 ) , which leads to endocytosis of virions ( 3 ) and early endosome formation ( 4 ) , and ultimately responsible for the release of viral RNA into the cytoplasm of host cells causing virulence . ACE2 = angiotensin - converting enzyme - 2 ; SARS - CoV - 2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ; TMPRSS2 = type - II transmembrane serine protease 2 .

COVID - 19 and Kidney Disease : Molecular Determinants and Clinical Implications in Renal Cancer . Eur Urol Focus ( 2020 ) , https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . euf . 2020 . 06 . 002 150 management might lead to missed opportunities for cura - 151 tive treatment and increased risks of cancer progression to 152 metastasis , anxiety , and stress . For patients experiencing 153 metastatic or recurrent cancer , considerations should 154 include how such delays may lead to immediate need for 155 hospital - based palliative care and symptom management 156 [ 27 ] . For patients receiving treatment with chemotherapy 157 or immunotherapy , or those who have undergone recent 158 surgery , the risks are even higher because of the reduced 159 immune system function . Reinforcement of the strict “ stay 160 at home ” policy , although efficient in reducing the risk of 161 exposure and contamination , is likely to increase patient 162 clinical care ( eg , managing disease and comorbidities ) , 163 financial ( eg , loss of job and medical insurance ) , and psy - 164 chosocial ( eg , social isolation , fear of contamination , stress , 165 and anxiety ) needs , thus worsening the quality of life and 166 emotional well - being in a population already burdened by 167 cancer and treatment impact . 168 To address some of these needs , several hospitals and 169 clinics in the USA have adopted a telehealth care delivery 170 approach ; however , such shifts in care delivery approaches 171 may pose significant challenges , especially for patients with 172 limited access to Internet or computer skills [ 28 ] . For 173 patients participating in cancer clinical trials , forced stay 174 home or quarantine complicates hospital attendance for 175 repeat appointments and continuity in care , and when 176 severe complications or emergencies occur , treatment 177 delays or unavailability will have significant implication 178 for the patient ’ s health [ 29 ] . For renal cancer patients and 179 patients with chronic renal disease in need of blood trans - 180 fusion or kidney or transplant , care has to be taken to ensure 181 the safety of blood or donor ’ s organs [ 30 ] . 182 3 . 3 . Surgical management of RCC amid COVID - 19 183 The goal of surgical treatment for RCC is twofold : the first is 184 the removal of the renal tumor with negative surgical 185 margins via either partial or radical nephrectomy based 186 on the tumor characteristics of size and location . This can 187 be accomplished via an open or minimally invasive ( robotic ) 188 approach . The second goal is the preservation of renal 189 function . Most guidelines agree that partial nephrectomy 190 should be performed for the renal mass when feasible to 191 maximally preserve kidney function and prevent end stage 192 renal disease . The COVID - 19 pandemic has transformed the 193 way we are approaching the surgical treatment of kidney 194 cancer . The recommendations to be followed to reduce this 195 risk to hospital workers are summarized in Table 1 . 196 3 . 4 . COVID - 19 impacts the kidney 197 3 . 4 . 1 . Chronic renal injury 198 As of March 31 , 2020 , the CDC reported that of the adults 199 hospitalized for COVID - 19 with underlying conditions in the 200 USA , 74 . 8 % had chronic renal disease , but patients with 201 chronic renal disease consisted of only 3 % of total cases 202 [ 26 , 31 ] . A study from Washington found that of 24 patients 203 admitted to the intensive care unit ( ICU ) , five ( 21 % ) had 204 chronic kidney disease [ 32 ] . In the Lombardy region of Italy , 205 of 1591 ICU patients with COVID - 19 from 72 hospitals , 36 206 ( 3 % ) had chronic kidney disease . Various studies from 207 Wuhan , China , investigating the early stages of the pan - 208 demic found that 2 – 4 % of COVID - 19 patients had chronic 209 renal failure [ 8 , 25 , 33 ] . However , in a lager study of 210 1099 cases from mainland China , only 0 . 7 % of patients 211 had chronic renal failure [ 5 ] . 212 Others have cautioned against the risk of COVID - 19 213 spread in hemodialysis ( HD ) centers [ 34 – 36 ] . In the USA 214 specifically , 0 . 5 million individuals receive dialysis treat - 215 ment and constitute a high - risk group for adult respiratory 216 distress syndrome [ 36 ] . Basile et al [ 37 ] studied a single HD 217 center in Renmin Hospital , Wuhan University . The authors 218 found that 37 of 230 patients on HD and four of 33 staff 219 members developed infections in a 1 - mo span from mid - 220 January to - February . Patients on HD with COVID - 19 had 221 less lymphopenia , lower serum levels of inflammatory 222 cytokines , and milder clinical disease than other patients 223 with COVID - 19 infection . Although six patients on HD died Table 1 – Clinical recomm Q1 endations to reduce transmission during renal surgery . Surgical patient triage Depending on local transmission patterns and hospital needs , lower - risk kidney tumors should be postponed , while larger and aggressive tumors should be treated as the risk of progression must be weighed against the risks of COVID - 19 . COVID - 19 testing All patients planning to undergo surgery for kidney cancer should be tested prior to surgery , depending on local community access to testing . COVID - 19 – positive patients If the patient is COVID - 19 positive , every effort should be made to delay surgery until full recovery of the patient and viral shedding risk is reduced . Operating room personnel Limit personnel in the operating room during surgery , allowing only essential personnel , and limit traf ﬁ c in and out of rooms . PPE PPE is mandatory and should include N - 95 masks to mitigate transmission risk . Operating room risk reduction Efforts should be made to reduce transmission during intubation and extubation , with only ESSENTIAL personnel present during these times . In addition , surgical transmission via surgical plume should be reduced by lowering cautery settings , application time , and total duration of tissue desiccation . Special considerations for minimally invasive surgery During minimally invasive surgery , CO 2 pressure should be maintained as low as safely possible , and gas leak or release from ports during surgery should be minimized . Every effort should be made to suction any residual CO 2 at the end of procedure prior to tumor extraction . A closed insuf ﬂ ation system should be used to reduce escape of CO 2 into the OR . Filters vary in size ; the smallest ﬁ lter available should be implemented to the suction system . COVID - 19 = coronavirus disease 2019 ; OR = operating room ; PPE = personal protective equipment .

COVID - 19 and Kidney Disease : Molecular Determinants and Clinical Implications in Renal Cancer . Eur Urol Focus ( 2020 ) , https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . euf . 2020 . 06 . 002 224 from the CoV infection , the presumed causes of death were 225 not related to pneumonia but rather to cardiovascular dis - 226 eases , cerebrovascular issues , and hyperkalemia [ 37 ] . The 227 emerging recommendations are that dialysis patients 228 infected with COVID - 19 should continue with their regimen 229 and stay at their current center , in order to minimize the risk 230 to other patients and healthcare personnel [ 34 ] . 231 3 . 4 . 2 . Acute kidney injury 232 In the previous SARS and MERS - CoV epidemics , acute kid - 233 ney injury ( AKI ) developed in 5 – 15 % of cases and had a high 234 mortality rate ( 60 – 90 % ) [ 34 , 38 , 39 ] . Kidney injury was also 235 associated with an increased risk of death in patients with 236 influenza A virus subtype H1N1 [ 40 ] . Similar results have 237 been found for the current SAS - CoV - 2 pandemic . In a post - 238 partum study of patients from Wuhan from January to the 239 beginning of March , Diao et al [ 9 ] showed that 27 . 06 % ( 23 / 240 85 ) patients exhibited acute renal failure . However , another 241 study conducted in a similar time frame in a hospital in 242 Wuhan did not have anyone to develop or die of acute renal 243 failure [ 33 ] . Several studies in China have tracked the devel - 244 opment of AKI once admitted for COVID - 19 . A smaller study 245 of 41 patients found that thee ( 7 % ) developed AKI . Other 246 studies in Wuhan have found rates around 3 – 4 % in a similar 247 time frame [ 6 , 25 ] . One study of 1099 cases from mainland 248 China showed that six ( 0 . 5 % ) COVID - 19 patients developed 249 AKI [ 5 ] . 250 A recent clinical study with 701 patients from a hospital 251 in Wuhan found that 5 . 1 % of patients admitted for COVID - 19 252 developed AKI [ 8 ] . The same study also reported that on 253 admission , 43 . 9 % of patients had proteinuria , 26 . 7 % had 254 hematuria , and 13 – 14 % had elevated serum creatinine , 255 elevated blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) , and estimated glomer - 256 ular filtration rate under 60 ml / min . The study confirmed 257 that elevated baseline serum creatinine , elevated baseline 258 BUN , AKI stage , proteinuria , and hematuria were indepen - 259 dent risk factors for in - hospital death . The incidence of AKI 260 was significantly higher in patients with elevated baseline 261 serum creatinine ; 33 . 7 % of these patients died in hospital , a 262 significantly higher percentage than that of patients with 263 normal creatinine levels . Computed tomography scans of 264 kidneys also showed reduced density , suggestive of inflam - 265 mation and edema [ 8 ] . 266 Further evidence confirmed overlap of COVID - 19 267 patients with renal dysfunction . In two hospitals in Wuhan , 268 59 % of patients with COVID - 19 had proteinuria , 44 % had 269 hematuria , 14 % had increased BUN levels , and 10 % had 270 increased serum creatinine [ 24 ] — data that were validated 271 in another hospital [ 33 ] . Individuals who developed AKI had 272 a 5 . 3 times higher mortality risk than those without AKI , 273 higher than that of comorbid chronic illness ( 1 . 5 times 274 more ) [ 24 ] . Clinical evidence from Shanghai revealed that 275 ICU patients were more likely to have increased creatinine 276 ( 15 . 8 % vs 4 . 1 % ) and BUN ( 26 . 3 % vs 5 . 7 % ) [ 41 ] . 277 The high ACE2 expression in the kidney and the presence 278 of fragments of CoV in the patient blood and urine implicate 279 COVID - 19 in the renal system [ 33 , 42 ] . Clinically , proteinuria 280 in a large number of patients can be caused by virus - 281 inducted cytopathic effect on podocytes , as podocyte injury 282 induces heavy proteinuria [ 43 ] . Increased creatinine levels 283 could also indicate indirect effects on renal function caused 284 by the virus , such as hypoxia , shock , and rhabdomyolysis 285 [ 4 , 8 ] . Specifically , the effects of CoV - infected ACE2 can 286 cause kidney damage through a heightened inflammatory 287 response by depleting Ang 1 – 7 and Ang 1 – 9 levels . A 288 systemic cytokine storm – induced inflammatory response 289 can also cause multiple organ damage [ 42 , 44 ] . It is unlikely 290 that kidney injury arises from deposition of immune com - 291 plex of viral antigen or virus - induced specific immunologi - 292 cal effector mechanisms because glomeruli microscopy 293 imaging has appeared normal in COVID - 19 patients [ 38 ] . 294 3 . 4 . 3 . Renal cancer 295 In addition to chronic and acute renal injury , renal cancer 296 must also be assessed when evaluating the risk factors of 297 developing severe COVID - 19 infections . In the USA , nearly 298 60 000 individuals had RCC in 2018 , although few studies 299 have evaluated the incidence of renal cancer in COVID - 19 300 cases [ 45 ] . Liang et al [ 46 ] found that 18 of 1590 cases had a 301 history of cancer in hospitals throughout China , a rate 302 higher than that of cancer in the overall Chinese population . 303 Lung cancer was the most frequent type of cancer in the 304 study population ( 28 % ) , but one case had a history of RCC . 305 Additionally , patients with cancer had a higher risk of 306 severe complications than patients without cancer ; cancer 307 patients treated with chemotherapy or surgery had a higher 308 risk of severe events than those not receiving treatment . 309 These are important considerations in decision making 310 regarding the clinical care of a cancer patient infected with 311 the virus ( Fig . 3 ) . 312 3 . 5 . Therapeutic management of RCC and COVID - 19 313 3 . 5 . 1 . Tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors 314 A majority of cases with RCC are associated with the gene 315 inactivation of von Hippel - Lindau , which normally regu - 316 lates the levels of hypoxia - inducible factors . With the inac - 317 tivation of this gene , the result is a subsequent downstream 318 upregulation of hypoxia - inducible factors , which then 319 causes angiogenesis and proliferation , mostly through the 320 activation of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 321 ( VEGFR ) [ 47 ] . Antiangiogenesis treatment of RCC includes 322 the use of monoclonal antibodies that bind and deplete 323 VEGF ligand , or bind to the VEGFR and tyrosine kinase 324 inhibitors ( TKIs ) that block the intracellular domain of 325 VEGFR . TKIs , specifically sunitinib and paxopanib , were first 326 to be approved for frontline treatment of metastatic RCC 327 ( mRCC ) [ 48 ] . 328 The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors ( ICIs ) has 329 become increasingly popular in the treatment of RCC . ICIs 330 work to prevent the downregulation of cellular immune 331 responses within tumors by targeting the interaction of 332 programmed cell death protein ( PD - 1 ) and its ligand ( PD - 333 L1 ) and CTLA - 4 and its ligand B7 - CTLA - 4 [ 49 ] . The standard 334 of care of mRCC following the approval of the Food and Drug 335 Administration ( FDA ) and the European Medicines Agency 336 is the combination of a TKI and an ICI , such as nivolumab 337 plus ipilimumab , which provides the best response rate and E U R O P E A N U R O L O G Y F O C U S X X X ( 2 0 1 9 ) X X X – X X X 5 EUF 937 1 – 10 Please cite this article in press as : Mihalopoulos M , et al .

There have also been proposals for other 339 combinations , such as pembrolizumab plus axitinib and ave - 340 lumab plus axitinib [ 53 ] . The efficacy of ICIs in conjugation 341 with COVID - 19 infection is under intense investigation . 342 Recent evidence suggests that restoration of immunocompe - 343 tence with ICIs impacts the development of cytokine release 344 syndrome and contributes to the severity of COVID - 19 and 345 ARDS [ 54 ] . Additionally , CoV - related interstitial pneumonia 346 could be worsened by potential pneumological toxicity from 347 anit - PD - 1 / PD - L1 ICI agents . However , discontinuation of ICIs 348 in patients with COVID - 19 infections is not recommended 349 due relatively better outcomes than in those patients who are 350 immunosuppressed from chemotherapy [ 46 , 54 ] . In one case 351 study , tocilizumab was used successfully to treat immune - 352 related adverse events ( irAEs ) , namely arthritis , in patients 353 receiving ICI therapy . Tocilizumab , a monoclonal antibody 354 against the interleukin ( IL ) - 6 receptor , serves as a potential 355 neutralizing antibody in treating COVID - 19 [ 34 ] . This is of 356 particular significance in the treatment of RCC patients with 357 COVID - 19 infection , as the treatment of ICIs and tocilizumab 358 may overcome irAE side effects . 359 3 . 5 . 2 . ACE inhibitors 360 RAS blockades , such as ACEis and ARBs , can potentially 361 reduce cancer growth , lessen metastatic potential , and 362 increase patient survival in RCC [ 55 , 56 ] . Lower expression 363 of Ang II receptors yielded better survival in patients with 364 clear cell RCC , and increased ACE activity has been associ - 365 ated with higher tumor grades [ 57 , 58 ] . While the decrease 366 in degradation of bradykinin by ACEis may stimulate 367 growth , survival , and migration of cancer cells , these effects 368 must ultimately be offset by the decrease in angiogenic 369 effects through the decreased VEGF expression due to 370 decreased Ang II [ 55 , 56 ] . There is also the potential for 371 Ang 1 – 7 , increased with the use of ACEis , to have antitumor 372 effects by decreasing cell migration and invasion of cancer 373 cells and reducing tumor growth by decreasing VEGF 374 [ 59 – 61 ] . Mechanistically , the therapeutic use of ACEis in 375 RCC has significant implications in the treatment of RCC 376 patients who are infected with COVID - 19 ( Fig . 2 ) . There is 377 the potential to increase an RCC patient ’ s susceptibility to a 378 more severe form of the disease due to increased ACE2 to 379 which the virus can bind with the administration of ACEis .

The top panel shows an overview of the primary signaling targets of viral infection and their association with renal disease . The bottom panel shows a proposed schema of the current therapeutic management ( blocking ACE2 receptor pathway and hence viral internalization into host cells ) and prevention strategies ( controlling inflammation and immunosuppression , and consequently cell response to virulence ) for COVID - 19 patients with underlying renal disease .

Endothelin receptor antagonists 381 Endothelin receptor antagonists ( ERAs ) have been devel - 382 oped for the treatment of various cancers including renal 383 cancer . The drugs decrease the effects of endothelin peptide 384 isoform 1 ( ET - 1 ) , which increases human tumor growth via 385 activation of epidermal growth factor receptor , and direct 386 angiogenic effects on endothelial cells through autocrine 387 and paracrine pathways . In this way , ERAs have been shown 388 to be effective cancer therapeutics [ 62 ] . ET - 1 affects the 389 kidney by binding to ET A and ET B G protein - coupled recep - 390 tors , inducing sodium retention , inflammation , and fibrosis 391 [ 63 ] . By mitigating these effects , ET A receptor antagonists 392 such as ERAs have been shown to be promising agents in the 393 treatment of chronic kidney disease as well [ 62 ] . Conse - 394 quential to its vasoconstrictive action , the endothelin axis 395 usually affects portal arterial hypertension ( PAH ) , and ERAs 396 are a common treatment against PAH by reducing the 397 vasoconstrictive effects of ET - 1 [ 62 ] . There is then the 398 potential of ERAs to help those with hypertension to defend 399 themselves against COVID - 19 . 400 3 . 6 . Stratification and screening COVID - 19 patients using liquid 401 biopsy “ Liquid biopsy ” is a minimally invasive procedure and a 402 powerful tool in obtaining a profile of the tumor pathology 403 [ 64 – 66 ] . Exosomes , cell - free ( cf ) DNA / RNA , and circulating 404 tumor cells ( CTCs ) are currently at the forefront of liquid 405 biopsy research , while cf proteins and lipids are also gaining 406 momentum , and various biosensing assays are being devel - 407 oped for their analyses [ 67 , 68 ] . Recent studies in RCC 408 patients have utilized blood - based assays in combination 409 with microRNA and / or protein biomarkers to provide 410 tumor monitoring at high sensitivity and specificity 411 [ 69 ] . Hence , RCC - associated biomarkers , which are found 412 in circulating bodily fluids , are strong indicators of an 413 unequivocal future of NextGen - liquid biopsy as novel tools 414 for disease monitoring , biomarker discovery , and precision 415 medicine . Recently , RCC - based liquid biopsy was validated 416 and approved by the US FDA for the prognosis and diag - 417 nosis of the disease [ 70 ] . RCC - associated tumor - based CTCs 418 and cfDNA are studied for their genomic and epigenomic 419 landscape , providing vital information about tumor het - 420 erogeneity and tissue lineage [ 70 ] . Furthermore , two 421 recent studies of several urinary - and serum - associated 422 protein and RNA biomarkers in RCC , carbonic anhydrase IX 423 ( CAIX ) and ceruloplasmin ( CP ) , were found to be signifi - 424 cantly increased in RCC patient ’ s urinary exosomes while 425 they remain the same in the control cohort [ 71 ] . Podoca - 426 lyxin - like protein 1 ( PODXL ; expressed in podocytes ) and 427 aquaporin 1 ( AQP1 , a water channel ) are proteins 428 expressed by kidney and not significantly increased in 429 RCC [ 71 ] . More recent evidence identified serum miR - 430 378 and miR - 451 as RCC biomarkers [ 69 ] . 431 Evidence on SARS - CoV - 2 assessment suggests that urine 432 contains almost no detectable COVID - 19 viral RNA load , and 433 only a small amount of viral RNA copies are present in blood 434 ( current tool of diagnosis is a nasopharyngeal swab fol - 435 lowed by a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ) 436 [ 72 ] . However , elevated serum creatinine , BUN , and hema - 437 turia shown during hospitalization of COVID - 19 patients are 438 associated with higher mortality , pointing to an indirect 439 mechanism of kidney damage in COVID - 19 – infected 440 patients [ 8 ] . This evidence supports that liquid biopsy – 441 assisted stratification and screening of COVID - 19 patients 442 with pre - existing RCC must focus on monitoring RCC bio - 443 markers before and after COVID - 19 infection . 444 3 . 7 . Treatment options to cure COVID - 19 445 For several of the patients with renal disease and AKI , 446 treatment course proceeds similarly to that of most 447 COVID - 19 cases , although we are following a learning curve . 448 General management including quarantining , use of pro - 449 tective personal equipment , nutritional and fluid support , 450 ICU admission when necessary , and other treatments for 451 complications are essential for all cases . Continuous renal 452 replacement therapy ( CRRT ) has been shown to be effective 453 in those with renal issues as well as other patients for SARS , 454 MERS , and sepsis [ 38 , 73 ] . CRRT is also being used in current 455 cases of COVID - 19 [ 33 ] , as are glucocorticoids , which when 456 administered in low doses improved outcomes for SARS and 457 MERS ; however , these drugs at high doses are associated 458 with high mortality due to inhibition of viral clearance and 459 prolongation of the duration of viremia [ 34 , 74 ] . Additional 460 therapeutic options effective in the treatment of COVID - 19 461 patients are discussed below [ 75 ] . 462 3 . 7 . 1 . Monoclonal antibodies 463 An important therapy in combating SARS - CoV - 2 is a neu - 464 tralizing antibody directed against the S protein of the virus 465 ( Fig . 1 ) . There exists a neutralizing monoclonal antibody 466 directed against the Ras - binding domain of the S protein of 467 MERS - CoV , suggesting the potential to discover a similar 468 antibody for SARS - CoV - 2 [ 76 ] . There have been promising 469 preliminary results for tocilizumab , a monoclonal antibody 470 against the IL - 6 receptor , but more work is necessary to 471 understand the safety and efficacy of the antibody [ 34 ] . The 472 development of neutralizing antibodies poses an issue in 473 rapid treatment strategy , as traditional screen options may 474 be too slow for the pandemic to ensure sufficient breadth of 475 treatment [ 75 ] . 476 3 . 7 . 2 . Oligonucleotides 477 Targeting the SARS - CoV - 2 viral RNA genome for degrada - 478 tion may hold a promise , but it is challenging during the 479 current pandemic , considering that viral RNA sequence 480 domains are not known and limited targeted delivery of 481 the oligonucleotide to the lungs may limit the scale - up 482 manufacturing of such drugs for a large population of 483 infected individuals [ 75 ] . 484 3 . 7 . 3 . Repurposing current antivirals 485 The Chinese National Health Commission recommends 486 interferon - a and lopinavir / ritonavir , HIV protease inhibi - 487 tors , in the treatment of COVID - 19 , as these treatments have 488 had some clinical efficacy in treating both SARS and COVID - 489 19 [ 34 , 77 ] .

Further research efforts focus on 493 drugs that inhibit endocytosis , as clathrin - dependent endo - 494 cytosis mediates the entry of SARS - CoV - 2 into cells . A low 495 pH and pH - dependent endosomal cysteine proteases cathe - 496 psins also facilitate the entry of the virus [ 79 ] . Thus , 497 lysosomotropic agents , such as the antimalaria drugs chlo - 498 roquine and hydroxychloroquine , can accumulate intracel - 499 lularly and neutralize the endosome - lysosomal acidic pH , 500 blocking protease activity and inhibiting viral entry into the 501 cell ( Fig . 2 ) . Endosome - lysosomal protease inhibitors such 502 as E64d or chlorpromazine , a clathrin - mediated endocyto - 503 sis inhibitor , can also block endocytosis directly [ 80 ] . 504 3 . 7 . 4 . Convalescent plasma antibody transfer 505 As tried during the 2014 – 2015 Ebola outbreak , the use of the 506 plasma of a recovered patient can provide polyclonal anti - 507 bodies to different viral antigens of SARS - CoV - 2 , which can 508 help treat patients who contract the virus later by providing 509 a neutralizing effect and increasing the immune response of 510 the patient . However , there are limitations in the speed and 511 scope of such a development [ 75 ] . 512 3 . 7 . 5 . Blocking ACE2 receptors 513 A potential new strategy for drug development involves 514 blocking the ACE2 receptor to inhibit the binding and 515 subsequent entry of SARS - CoV - 2 into cells . An antibody 516 binding to the ACE2 protein blocks the entry of SARS effec - 517 tively . Additionally , a small receptor - binding domain from 518 the SARS S protein , which binds to the ACE2 receptor , has 519 been shown to be effective in blocking the entry of SARS in 520 cell culture [ 81 ] . 521 3 . 7 . 6 . ACE2 immunoadhesion strategy 522 A novel approach involves binding to the CoV itself through 523 a soluble version of the ACE2 receptor , fused to an immu - 524 noglobulin Fc domain ( ACE2 - Fc ) that binds to the S protein 525 of SARS - CoV - 2 and neutralizes the virus ( Fig . 1 ) . This meth - 526 odology would allow for maximal breath , maximally engage 527 the immune system to build lasting immunity , and decrease 528 ACE2 levels in the lungs during infection , thus impacting 529 acute respiratory distress pathophysiology [ 75 ] . Testing for 530 the efficacy and safety of this novel therapeutic strategy is 531 necessary , prior to clinical implementation . 532 3 . 8 . Future directions 533 Through repurposing existing drugs such as ACEis and 534 developing new antibodies to combat SARS - CoV - 2 , future 535 clinical trials in COVID - 19 patients battling RCC are a top 536 priority in overcoming the pandemic ( Fig . 3 ) . Mechanistic 537 exploitation of the baseline expression of ACE2 and 538 TMPRSS2 in the lung epithelium and kidney tissue of RCC 539 patients will lead to their therapeutic targeting and corre - 540 lation with the therapeutic response . Whole - blood , whole - 541 urine genomics have yet to be investigated in COVID - 19 542 patients ; of immediate clinical significance will be a study 543 of cfDNA , CTCs , exosome - based biomarker ’ s correlation , 544 and their genomic landscape among RCC and COVID - 19 – 545 positive patients to enable new insights into the down - 546 stream effect of viral damage on renal function . Liquid 547 biopsy could be the most effective tool for early identifica - 548 tion , intervention , and improved prognosis among RCC 549 patients harboring SARS - CoV - 2 infection . As research 550 efforts escalate globally toward the eradication of COVID - 551 19 in cancer patients , our team joins the battle , driven by 552 science - based evidence to develop action guidelines and 553 therapeutic strategies in the management of RCC patients 554 diagnosed with COVID - 19 . 555 4 . Conclusions 556 This analysis will advance our understanding of the molec - 557 ular signatures shared by RCC and COVID - 19 , and the clini - 558 cal implications of overlapping signaling pathways in the 559 therapeutic management of RCC and COVID - 19 patients . 560 Author contributions : Natasha Kyprianou had full access to all the data 561 in the study and takes responsibility for the integrity of the data and the 562 accuracy of the data analysis . 563 Study concept and design : Kyprianou , Badani . 564 Acquisition of data : Mihalopoulos , Dogra , Mohamed . 565 Analysis and interpretation of data : Mihalopoulos , Badani , Kyprianou . 566 Drafting of the manuscript : Mihalopoulos , Dogra , Mohamed , Badani . 567 Critical revision of the manuscript for important intellectual content : 568 Kyprianou , Badani . 569 Statistical analysis : Mihalopoulos , Mohamed . 570 Obtaining funding : None . 571 Administrative , technical , or material support : Dogra , Mohamed . 572 Supervision : Kyprianou . 573 Other : None . 574 Financial disclosures : Natasha Kyprianou certi ﬁ es that all con ﬂ icts of 575 interest , including speci ﬁ c ﬁ nancial interests and relationships and 576 af ﬁ liations relevant to the subject matter or materials discussed in the 577 manuscript ( eg , employment / af ﬁ liation , grants or funding , consultan - 578 cies , honoraria , stock ownership or options , expert testimony , royalties , 579 or patents ﬁ led , received , or pending ) , are the following : None . 580 Funding / Support and role of the sponsor : None .
