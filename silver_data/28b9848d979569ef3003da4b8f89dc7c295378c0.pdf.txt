Kovar , Jeffrey R . Kuhn , Andrea L . Tichy , and Thomas D . Pollard Department of Molecular , Cellular , and Developmental Biology , Yale University , New Haven , CT 06520 ytokinesis in most eukaryotes requires the assembly and contraction of a ring of actin ﬁlaments and myosin II . The ﬁssion yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe requires the formin Cdc12p and proﬁlin ( Cdc3p ) early in the assembly of the contractile ring . The proline - rich formin homology ( FH ) 1 domain binds proﬁlin , and the FH2 domain binds actin . Expression of a construct consisting of the Cdc12 FH1 and FH2 domains complements a con - ditional mutant of Cdc12 at the restrictive temperature , but arrests cells at the permissive temperature . Cells over - expressing Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p stop growing with excessive actin cables but no contractile rings . Like capping protein , puriﬁed Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p caps the barbed end of actin ﬁlaments , preventing subunit addition and dissociation , inhibits end to end annealing of ﬁlaments , and nucleates C ﬁlaments that grow exclusively from their pointed ends . The maximum yield is one ﬁlament pointed end per six formin polypeptides . Proﬁlins that bind both actin and poly - L - proline inhibit nucleation by Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p , but polymerization of monomeric actin is faster , because the ﬁlaments grow from their barbed ends at the same rate as uncapped ﬁlaments . On the other hand , Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p blocks annealing even in the presence of proﬁlin . Thus , formins are proﬁlin - gated barbed end capping proteins with the ability to initiate actin ﬁlaments from actin mono - mers bound to proﬁlin . These properties explain why contractile ring assembly requires both formin and proﬁlin and why viability depends on the ability of proﬁlin to bind both actin and poly - L - proline . Introduction Compared with the rapidly accumulating evidence about the assembly of the actin network at the leading edge of cells ( Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) , much less is known about the assembly of the actomyosin contractile ring during cytokinesis ( Robinson and Spudich , 2000 ) . Lacking bio - chemical assays for cytokinesis , the field has depended largely on genetics to identify the participating proteins . The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is the cell with the most complete inventory of cytokinesis genes , (cid:2) 50 ( Le Goff et al . , 1999 ; Guertin et al . , 2002 ) . Both preexisting and newly polymerized actin filaments contribute to the contractile ring , which turns over throughout cleavage ( Pelham and Chang , 2002 ) . Actin - binding proteins that coordinate contractile ring assembly in fission yeast include IQGAP ( Rng2p ) , type - II myosins ( Myo2p and Myp2p ) , Arp2 / 3 complex ( arp3 and wsp1 ) , tropomyosin ( Cdc8p ) , profilin ( Cdc3p ) , and the formin Cdc12p ( for reviews see Le Goff et al . , 1999 ; Feierbach and Chang , 2001a ; Guertin et al . , 2002 ) . Formins , cytoskeleton - organizing proteins of plants , animals , and fungi , contain three conserved formin homology ( FH ) * domains : FH1 , FH2 , and FH3 ( for review see Wasserman , 1998 ) . FH1 is rich in proline and binds profilin ( Wasserman , 1998 ) , and FH2 interacts with actin ( Pruyne et al . , 2002 ; Pring et al . , 2003 ) . Other domains are responsible for local - ization , autoinhibition , and regulation by Rho - family GTPases ( Alberts , 2001 ) . Fission yeast has three formin genes : cdc12 , required for cytokinesis ( Chang et al . , 1997 ) , for3 , required for interphase actin cables ( Feierbach and Chang , 2001b ; Nakano et al . , 2002 ) , and fus1 , required for mating ( Petersen et al . , 1998 ) .

Both formin and the small actin – binding protein profilin ( Balasubramanian et al . , 1994 ; Haugwitz et al . , 1994 ; Verheyen and Cooley , 1994 ; Severson et al . , 2002 ; Tolliday et al . , 2002 ) are required for cytokinesis and incorporation of actin into the contractile ring ( Pelham and Chang , 2002 ; Tolliday et al . , 2002 ) . Formins appear to act directly on actin , because expression of a fragment of the budding yeast formins Bni1p and Bnr1p , containing the FH1 and FH2 domains , induces ac - tin cables in vivo ( Evangelista et al . , 2002 ; Sagot et al . , 2002a ) , and because isolated Bni ( FH1FH2 ) p stimulates the polymerization of purified actin ( Pruyne et al . , 2002 ; Sagot et al . , 2002b ; Pring et al . , 2003 ) . Interestingly , profilin is re - quired for formin to promote actin assembly in vivo ( Evan - gelista et al . , 2002 ; Sagot et al . , 2002a ) but not in vitro ( Pruyne et al . , 2002 ; Sagot et al . , 2002b ; Pring et al . , 2003 ) . To learn why contractile ring assembly in fission yeast de - pends on both the formin Cdc12p and the profilin Cdc3p , we characterized the FH1 and FH2 domains of Cdc12p , which correspond to the domains of Bni1p that stimulate actin assembly . In the absence of profilin , formins nucleate actin assembly similar to capping proteins ( Cooper and Pol - lard , 1985 ) , but profilin changes the mechanism so that Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p nucleates filaments that grow rapidly from their barbed ends . These results explain why cells de - pend on both formin and profilin for actin polymerization during contractile ring assembly in vivo . Results Overexpression of formin Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p in fission yeast To learn how the fission yeast formin Cdc12p regulates ac - tin filament assembly during cytokinesis , we focused on a construct consisting of the FH1 and FH2 domains ( Fig . 1 Figure 1 .

Cdc12 - 112 cells with either a control ( pREP41 ) or a pREP41 - cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) plasmid were grown in the absence of thiamine to induce expression of Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p . Overexpression of Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p allowed growth of cdc12 - 112 cells at the restrictive temperature ( 36 (cid:3) C ) but arrested cells at the permissive temperature ( 25 (cid:3) C ) on minimal media ( EMM ) plates after 72 h .

Although this fragment lacks the regulatory domains flanking the FH1 and FH2 domains , the comparable fragment of the budding yeast formin Bni1p promotes actin polymerization in vivo and in vitro ( Evange - lista et al . , 2002 ; Pruyne et al . , 2002 ; Sagot et al . , 2002a , b ) . The size of the Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p fragment is based upon the Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p fragment of Sagot et al . ( 2002b ) , which is shorter by (cid:2) 70 residues than the Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p fragment of Pruyne et al . ( 2002 ) and Pring et al . ( 2003 ) at the COOH terminus of the FH2 domain . Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p is a functional fragment , as overexpression of Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p complemented the cdc12 - 112 tempera - ture - sensitive mutant ( Chang et al . , 1997 ) at the restrictive temperature of 36 (cid:3) C ( Fig . 1 C ) . Overexpression of Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p arrested the growth of both cdc12 - 112 cells at the permissive temperature of 25 (cid:3) C ( Fig . 1 C ) and wild - type cells ( Fig . 1 , D – H ) . Thus , Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p can replace the essential functions of Cdc12p in vivo when Cdc12p is nonfunctional , but is toxic when overexpressed in the pres - ence of functional Cdc12p . Wild - type fission yeast overexpressing Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p contained an impressive enrichment of actin filaments in ab - errant thick cables and aster - like accumulations when visual - ized with rhodamine - phalloidin , but lacked both actin con - tractile rings and polarized actin patches ( Fig . 1 D ) . Cells overexpressing Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p arrested after (cid:2) 24 h ( Fig . 1 E ) . Growth arrest coincided with an increase in cells with multiple nuclei ( Fig . 1 F ) and abnormal ( partial , broad , and misoriented ) septa ( Fig . 1 G ) and a decrease in cells with contractile rings ( Fig . 1 H ) . Effects of Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p on subunit association and dissociation at the ends of actin filaments Like budding yeast Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p , fission yeast Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p purified from bacteria ( Fig . 1 B ) stimulated ac - tin polymerization , as detailed below ( see Fig . 4 ) . Interpreta - tion of these experiments requires knowledge of the effect of these constructs on the addition and dissociation of subunits at the two ends of the filaments . Therefore , we begin with three independent lines of evidence that Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p caps the barbed ends of actin filaments with high affinity , al - lowing elongation only at pointed ends . First , 100 nM Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p increased the critical concentration ( C c ) for actin assembly from 0 . 13 (cid:4) M , near the critical concentration of the barbed end , to 0 . 9 (cid:4) M , the critical concentration of the pointed end ( Fig . 2 A ) . 10 nM Mus musculus capping protein ( Mm CP ; Palmgren et al . , 2001 ) shifted the critical concentration to 1 . 0 (cid:4) M ( Fig . 2 A ) . The critical concentration depended on the concentra - tion of Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p ( Fig . 2 B ) , with the shift from the barbed to pointed end occurring between 1 and 10 nM Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p . Thus , the dissociation equilibrium con - stant ( K d ) for Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p at barbed ends is (cid:5) 0 . 5 (cid:4) M ( Caldwell et al . , 1989 ) . Second , both Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p and Mm CP inhibited depolymerization of actin filaments diluted to 0 . 1 (cid:4) M ( Fig . 2 C ) . Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p reduced the rate of depolymeriza - tion to 34 % of the rate in the absence of formin ( Fig . 2 D ) . Mm CP reduced the rate of depolymerization to 27 % ( Fig . 2 D ) . This is consistent with Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p and Mm CP capping the barbed ( fast depolymerizing ) ends of the fila - ments with high affinity ( K d (cid:5) 0 . 1 (cid:4) M ) , allowing dissocia - tion only from the slowly depolymerizing ( Pollard , 1986 ) pointed ends ( Caldwell et al . , 1989 ) . In both cases , an initial fast phase of depolymerization was followed by a slow phase , as expected for a second order barbed end capping reaction . Third , real - time visualization of actin assembly by total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy ( Amann and Pollard , 2001 ) revealed that Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p caps barbed ends but allows growth at pointed ends ( Fig . 3 ) . Ac - tin alone elongated at both ends : 19 subunits / s at the barbed ends and 0 . 8 subunits / s at the pointed ends ( Fig . 3 A ) . These rates are slightly slower than expected from the estab - lished rate constants ( Pollard , 1986 ) because elongation of labeled actin is slower than unlabeled actin ( Amann and Pol - lard , 2001 ; unpublished data ) . After 500 s , the filaments Figure 2 . Effect of Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p and mouse capping protein ( Mm CP ) on actin depolymerization and critical concentration .

Actin ( 5 % pyrene labeled ) was polymerized for 16 h . The polymer concentration was measured from the pyrene fluorescence , plotted versus actin concentration , and fit by linear regression . The C c values were 0 . 1 (cid:4) M for actin alone , 0 . 9 (cid:4) M with 100 nM Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p , and 1 . 0 (cid:4) M with 10 nM Mm CP .

The data from 300 – 1 , 000 s of each curve was fit with single exponentials , and the depolymerization rates were expressed as a fraction of the rate of actin alone . on J une 27 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published June 9 , 2003 Th e J ou r n a l o f C e ll B i o l o gy 878 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 161 , Number 5 , 2003 ranged in length from (cid:5) 500 to (cid:2) 10 , 000 subunits , as appro - priate for a population that formed at random times by spontaneous nucleation and grew at 20 subunits / s for up to 500 s . Mouse capping protein produced two populations of fila - ments : many with short , uniform lengths and others with intermediate but variable lengths ( Fig . 3 B ) . All of these fila - ments grew at only one end , at a rate of 0 . 5 subunits / s , as appropriate for pointed ends . Given their length and the time available for polymerization , the few filaments of inter - mediate length must have formed spontaneously and grown transiently at their barbed ends before being capped . These events occurred during the 90 s required to prepare these samples . In other experiments , the addition of capping pro - tein to elongating actin filaments in a flow cell abruptly stopped barbed end growth ( unpublished data ) . The polymerization of actin in the presence of Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p produced numerous short filaments and some longer filaments ( Fig . 3 C ) . The population of short , uni - form filaments grew at a rate of 0 . 3 subunits / s , consistent with growing from only the pointed end . Robust linear re - gression of a plot of total length versus reaction time ( Fig . 3 F ) placed the apparent starting length of the short filaments at 240 subunits . As all dimensions of these filaments are in - flated by (cid:2) 260 subunits ( measured from the width of the fluorescent images ) , these short filaments were initiated soon after mixing Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p with actin and therefore were nucleated by Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p . The population of Figure 3 . Real - time visualization of actin assembly in the presence of Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p or mouse capping protein by TIRF microscopy . The conditions were as follows : 3 (cid:4) M ( 25 % Oregon green 488 – labeled ) Mg - ATP actin , 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM EGTA , 50 mM DTT , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 50 (cid:4) M CaCl 2 , 15 mM glucose , 20 (cid:4) g / ml catalase , 100 (cid:4) g / ml glucose oxidase , 0 . 5 % methylcellulose at 25 (cid:3) C . Flow cells were coated with NEM - myosin to capture the actin filaments . Direct comparisons of samples stained with rhodamine - phalloidin and adsorbed to coverslips coated with poly - L - lysine ( Fig . 4 ) showed that the conditions of these TIRF experiments strongly favored the observation of long filaments . In fact , we observed no filaments at concentrations of Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p (cid:2) 500 nM , where the biochemical results ( and rhodamine - phalloidin staining ) indicated numerous short filaments .

( E ) Pointed ends of long filaments in the presence of Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p grew continuously ( solid line ) at a rate of 0 . 6 (cid:7) 0 . 1 subunits / s ( n (cid:6) 10 ) .

The total length of short filaments ( arrowheads in C ) versus total reaction time showed uniform growth at a rate of 0 . 3 (cid:7) 0 . 1 subunits / s ( solid line ; n (cid:6) 10 ) and an apparent starting length of 240 (cid:7) 30 subunits . Diffraction increased the apparent 1 / e width and length of individual actin filaments to 0 . 7 (cid:4) m , or 260 subunits , so the starting length was zero . on J une 27 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published June 9 , 2003 Th e J ou r n a l o f C e ll B i o l o gy Mechanism of actin nucleation by Cdc12p | Kovar et al . 879 longer actin filaments initially grew at both ends , accounting for their considerable lengths . Fast ends grew at a barbed end rate of 25 subunits / s until they stopped permanently at random times ( Fig . 3 D ) . These capping events occurred over a much longer time than capping by Mm CP , so we conclude that Mm CP caps barbed ends faster than Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p . The slower ends of the long filaments grew at a pointed end rate of 0 . 6 subunits / s throughout the time course ( Fig . 3 E ) . This rate was slightly higher than the poly - merization rate of the short filaments , but the difference is not significant given the noise in these assays . Effect of Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p on spontaneous actin assembly Fission yeast Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p stimulated the spontaneous assembly of Mg - actin monomers , reducing the lag at the on - set of the reaction and increasing the maximum rate of poly - merization just like Mm CP ( Fig . 4 A ) . The stimulation of polymerization depended on the concentration of each pro - tein ( Fig . 4 B ) and the effects of Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p and Mm CP were additive ( Fig . 4 C ) rather than antagonistic . Both Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p and Mm CP required almost 2 . 0 (cid:4) M Mg – G - actin to stimulate spontaneous polymerization ( Fig . 4 H ) . Fluorescence microscopy of the products of these reac - tions labeled with rhodamine - phalloidin showed that fila - ments formed in the presence of either Mm CP ( Fig . 4 F ) or Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p ( Fig . 4 G ) were much shorter than actin alone ( Fig . 4 E ) . Number average filament lengths depended on the concentration of Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p : 20 (cid:4) m for 4 (cid:4) M Mg - ATP actin alone ; 1 . 8 (cid:4) m in 25 nM Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p ; 1 . 02 (cid:4) m in 100 nM ; 0 . 8 (cid:4) m for 200 nM ; and 0 . 6 (cid:4) m in 250 nM . The average length was 0 . 9 (cid:4) m in 100 nM Mm CP . Thus , formin and capping protein nucle - ated numerous filaments that grew slowly and did not an - neal . Knowing that filaments grow at their pointed ends , we calculated that Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p produced a maximum concentration of (cid:2) 17 nM ends ( Fig . 4 B ) . The maximum yield of 0 . 17 pointed ends per formin polypeptide was at 5 . 0 nM Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p ( Fig . 4 D ) , with lower yields at higher concentrations ( Fig . 4 D ) . Mm CP also produced a maximum of 17 nM pointed ends ( Fig . 4 B ) , with a maxi - mum yield of 0 . 29 filaments per capping protein het - erodimer at 10 nM Mm CP ( Fig . 4 D ) . A nucleation effi - ciency of (cid:5) 100 % , which peaks at a low concentration of barbed end capper , is expected from the strong actin mono - mer concentration dependence of nucleation ( Fig . 4 H ) and the depletion of the subunit pool by the high concentration of pointed ends , which consume subunits faster than the rate of nucleation . Effect of profilin and Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p on actin filament elongation Profilin had a dramatic influence on Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p , in - hibiting nucleation but allowing full - speed growth at barbed ends . The net effect of profilin is the assembly of fewer fila - ments that grow rapidly at their barbed ends . We will present the case for this mechanism starting with the evi - dence for barbed end growth . Figure 4 .

Instead of growing only at their pointed ends as with Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p alone , all of the filaments measured ( chosen randomly ) with both Cdc12 Figure 5 .

Owing to the high concentration of filaments and their rapid growth , these samples depleted the actin monomer concentration with an exponential time course and a half time of 202 (cid:7) 88 s , such that they were growing at less than their maximum rate when first observed 100 s after initiation of polymeriza - tion . By extrapolation , we calculated the average initial rate to be 12 . 4 (cid:7) 5 . 9 / s , similar to the rate of growth at barbed ends of actin alone , 16 . 2 (cid:7) 0 . 1 / s , or actin plus profilin , 16 . 6 (cid:7) 0 . 1 / s . The low concentrations of filaments in these control samples did not deplete the subunit pool , so they were growing at their maximum rate when first observed and continuously thereafter for (cid:2) 900 s . Extrapolation of the exponential time courses for actin with Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p and profilin to zero length showed that most filaments be - gan growing soon after initiating the reaction . Variations in the time of nucleation or annealing ( rather than intermittent or variable rates of elongation ) account for the variations in length observed at the end of the reaction . The combination of Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p and profilin - Y5D , with affinity for poly - L - proline reduced 100 - fold ( Lu and Pollard , 2001 ) , prevented both barbed and pointed end filament growth ( unpublished data ) . To learn if profilin dissociates Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p from the barbed ends of filaments , we tested the effects of Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p and profilin on the annealing of pre - formed filaments ( Fig . 6 ) . We sheared a mixture of 0 . 25 (cid:4) M red ( rhodamine - phalloidin ) - and green ( Alexa ® 488 - phalloi - din ) - labeled actin filaments and followed annealing by fluo - rescence microscopy for up to 60 min ( Andrianantoandro et al . , 2001 ) . 5 min after shearing , the actin filaments averaged 2 . 1 (cid:4) m in length with 0 . 075 annealing red / green events per filament ( Fig . 6 A ) . After 60 min , actin filaments averaged 7 . 2 (cid:4) m in length with an average of 2 . 1 red / green annealing events per filament ( Fig . 6 B ) . This assay underestimates an - nealing because it does not detect red / red or green / green an - nealing events . 5 (cid:4) M profilin inhibited annealing modestly , with an average filament length of 5 . 9 (cid:4) m with 1 . 2 red / green annealing events per filament after 60 min ( Fig . 6 C ) , perhaps due to association with the barbed ends of actin fila - ments ( Pollard and Cooper , 1984 ) . Annealing was strongly inhibited by 400 nM capping protein ( Fig . 6 D ) , 400 nM Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p alone ( Fig . 6 E ) , or 400 nM Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p with 5 (cid:4) M profilin ( Fig . 6 F ) , all yielding fila - ments (cid:2) 2 (cid:4) m long with (cid:5) 0 . 02 annealing events per fila - ment 60 min after shearing . As little as 25 nM Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p inhibited annealing to the same extent as 400 nM Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p , and a range of profilin concentra - tions ( 100 nM – 5 (cid:4) M ) did not overcome this inhibition . Therefore , profilin appears to allow barbed end growth without removing formin . Experiments on bulk samples confirmed that profilin al - lows actin filaments to elongate at their barbed ends in the presence of Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p . Profilin inhibited the ability of Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p to shift the critical concentration for actin assembly from that of the barbed end to that of the pointed end ( Fig . 7 A ) .

The concentration of profilin determined its ability to inhibit the shift in the critical concentration caused by Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p ( Fig . 7 B ) , consistent with a low micromolar K d for profilin and formin . Profilins lacking affinity for either actin monomers ( profilin - K81E ) or the formin FH1 domain ( profilin - Y5D ) did not inhibit barbed end capping by Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p ( Fig . 7 A ) . A depolymerization experiment addressed whether profi - lin allows subunits to dissociate from barbed ends in the presence of Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p ( Fig . 7 , C and D ) . Profilin prevented Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p ( Fig . 7 D ) but not Mm CP ( Fig . 7 C ) from reducing the depolymerization rate of actin filaments diluted to 0 . 1 (cid:4) M . This effect required profilin binding to both actin and poly - L - proline ( Fig . 7 D ) . Thus , profilin allows subunit addition and loss at barbed ends satu - rated with Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p . Effect of profilin on spontaneous actin assembly in the presence of Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p Profilin had opposite effects on spontaneous polymerization of Mg - ATP actin monomers in the presence of Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p and capping protein . Like other profilins , wild - type fission yeast profilin inhibited spontaneous polymeriza - tion of actin ( Lu and Pollard , 2001 ) and polymerization ini - tiated by capping protein ( Fig . 8 , A and C ) . However , in the presence of 25 nM Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p ( Fig . 8 , A and B ) , concentrations of profilin up to 5 (cid:4) M reduced the initial lag at the outset of polymerization and increased the rate of polymer formation . The calculation of filament ends revealed that profilin inhibited nucleation by Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p , and that this stimulation of polymerization by profilin was due solely to enhancing the rate of elongation . Given that profilin allows barbed end growth ( Fig . 5 ) , the polymerization rates corre - spond to a maximum yield of only 0 . 015 barbed ends per formin polypeptide . In the absence of profilin , 25 nM Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p yielded 0 . 09 pointed ends per formin polypeptide ( Fig . 4 ) . This sixfold reduction in nucleation by profilin can be attributed to the inhibition of both spontane - ous and Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p - mediated nucleation as well as depletion of the actin monomer pool by rapid elongation at the barbed ends that were created . Concentrations of wild - type profilin (cid:2) 5 (cid:4) M reduced nucleation by 25 nM Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p even further ( Fig . 8 B ) . Consistent with barbed end growth , wild - type profilin lowered the mono - mer concentration required for spontaneous assembly with Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p ( Fig . 8 D ) . The ability of profilin to promote spontaneous polymer - ization by Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p required that the profilin have affinity for both actin monomers and proline - rich sequences ( FH1 domain ) . Profilin - K81E lacking affinity for actin had no effect on polymerization with Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p ( Fig . 8 A ) . Profilin - Y5D lacking affinity for poly - L - proline inhibited spontaneous assembly of actin in both the absence and pres - ence of Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p ( Fig . 8 , A and B ) . Wild - type profilin and profilin - Y5D inhibited polymerization with Mm CP ( Fig . 8 C ) . Fluorescence microscopy of the products of these poly - merization reactions confirmed that profilin allows Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p to nucleate a modest number of longer fila - ments . We stopped the reactions and labeled the filaments with rhodamine - phalloidin ( Fig . 8 , E – H ) 600 s after initiat - ing polymerization ( Fig . 8 A ) . The number average lengths of filaments were 22 . 3 (cid:4) m for 4 (cid:4) M Mg - ATP actin alone ( Fig . 8 E ) , 19 . 7 (cid:4) m for 4 (cid:4) M Mg - ATP actin with 5 (cid:4) M profilin ( Fig . 8 F ) , 1 . 0 (cid:4) m for 4 (cid:4) M Mg - ATP actin with 100 nM Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p ( Fig . 8 G ) , and 3 . 5 (cid:4) m for 4 (cid:4) M Mg - ATP actin with 100 nM Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p and 5 (cid:4) M profilin ( Fig . 8 H ) . We calculated the number con - centration of filaments by dividing the polymer concen - tration by the average filament length ( in subunits ) . The number of filaments formed with Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p was approximately threefold less in the presence of profilin . 5 Figure 7 .

Discussion Our data on fission yeast Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p agree in general with the findings of Pruyne et al . ( 2002 ) , Sagot et al . ( 2002b ) , and Pring et al . ( 2003 ) on budding yeast Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p , so we think that both formins have simi - lar mechanisms of action . The expression of constructs con - sisting of formin FH1 and FH2 domains at least partially complements the loss of formin function in both budding yeast ( Sagot et al . , 2002b ) and fission yeast ( this paper ) . Overexpression of ( FH1FH2 ) p is lethal and dramatically in - creases actin cables in both yeast ( Pruyne et al . , 2002 ; Sa - got et al . , 2002b ; this paper ) . In vitro , purified formin ( FH1FH2 ) p constructs from both yeast stimulate the spon - taneous assembly of actin filaments . Low concentrations of wild - type profilin enhance formin - induced polymerization , whereas higher concentrations inhibit actin polymerization ( Sagot et al . , 2002b ; Pring et al . , 2003 ; this paper ) . The abil - ity of profilin to enhance actin polymerization by formins requires that the profilin binds both actin monomers and Figure 8 .

Although these data agree , additional evidence presented here revealed a mechanism of formin ac - tion different than proposed earlier . We find that Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p alone caps actin filament barbed ends and nucleates new filaments that grow exclu - sively from their pointed end . Profilin completely changes the reaction by inhibiting nucleation , uncapping barbed ends , and allowing formin - nucleated filaments to grow ex - clusively from their barbed ends ( see Fig . S1 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200211078 / DC1 ) . These insights explain why profilin is necessary in vivo for formin - dependent assembly of contractile rings and actin ca - bles but is not required in vitro for formin - driven actin poly - merization . Formins cap the barbed end of actin filaments Sagot et al . ( 2002b ) and Pruyne et al . ( 2002 ) concluded that FH1FH2 constructs alone nucleate filaments that grow from their barbed ends . This interpretation was based on the ability of cytochalasins to inhibit polymerization stimulated by formin or spectrin – actin seeds , but not polymerization by the barbed end capping protein gelsolin . These investigators assumed that cytochalasins only inhibit growth at barbed ends , but the concentrations used inhibit elongation at both ends ( Sampath and Pollard , 1991 ) . Consequently , inhibi - tion by cytochalasin is not a decisive test for the direction of growth . It is not clear to us why 2 (cid:4) M cytochalasin B failed to inhibit growth from gelsolin nuclei ( Pruyne et al . , 2002 ) . On the other hand , Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p was found to bind near the barbed ends of actin filaments and slowed barbed end assembly and disassembly by 50 % , suggesting that Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p partially caps barbed ends ( Pruyne et al . , 2002 ; Pring et al . , 2003 ) . Direct experimental comparison is required to determine what differences , if any , exist between fission and budding yeast formin constructs . All of our evidence is consistent with formin ( FH1FH2 ) p constructs functioning like classic barbed end capping proteins that prevent subunit loss and addition at the barbed end and shift the critical concentration for assembly to that of the pointed end . Like capping protein , Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p nucleates filaments that grow exclusively from their pointed ends . Accordingly , formins may promote actin nucleation either by resembling an actin dimer or by captur - ing actin monomers or dimers like capping protein ( Cooper and Pollard , 1985 ; Caldwell et al . , 1989 ) . The available evidence suggests interesting similarities and differences between formins and capping protein . Given suf - ficient actin monomers , both proteins initiate numerous pointed ends . Although each filament grows slowly , their abundance rapidly consumes the available actin subunits . Because nucleation reactions depend strongly on the con - centration of actin monomer , the rate of nucleation by formin and capping protein falls rapidly during a reaction and the concentration of ends peaked under our conditions when only 30 % of the subunits were assembled . In contrast , Arp2 / 3 complex makes new filaments until nearly all of the subunits are consumed ( Higgs et al . , 1999 ) . The maximum yield of new ends per initiator protein is achieved at very low concentrations of formin and capping protein , as higher concentrations accelerate depletion of the subunit pool . Al - though similar in many ways , capping protein caps barbed ends faster than formin . In TIRF experiments , the small number of barbed ends that formed spontaneously grew longer in the presence of 250 nM Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p than in the presence of 50 nM capping protein . Capping protein capped most of the barbed ends during the (cid:2) 90 s required to initiate observations , whereas formin capping continued over 10 min . Given the functional similarities , we considered whether formin FH2 domains might be folded like capping protein . Capping proteins are heterodimers of (cid:9) and (cid:10) subunits hav - ing the same fold ( Yamashita et al . , 2003 ) but sharing only 30 % conserved ( identical plus similar ) residues . The genes for (cid:9) and (cid:10) subunits have diverged not only from each other but also between species , as evolutionarily distant (cid:9) subunits are conserved at only (cid:2) 45 % of the residue positions and distant (cid:10) subunits are conserved at only (cid:2) 60 % of positions . Genes coding formin FH2 domains have also diverged con - siderably between and within species , being conserved at only (cid:2) 40 % of residue positions between evolutionarily dis - tant species . We note that FH2 domains and capping pro - tein subunits are approximately the same size and that the amino acid sequences can be aligned with few gaps ( see Figs . S2 and S3 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200211078 / DC1 ) . In these alignments , FH2 domain residues are conserved relative to evolutionarily distant cap - ping protein (cid:9) subunits at (cid:2) 23 % of the positions and with (cid:10) subunits at (cid:2) 22 % of the positions . Within a given spe - cies , FH2 domain residues are conserved relative to their own capping protein (cid:9) subunits at (cid:2) 21 % of positions and with (cid:10) subunits at (cid:2) 22 % of positions . In the chicken cap - ping protein structure , 37 residues are structurally conserved between the (cid:9) and (cid:10) subunits ( Yamashita et al . , 2003 ) . About 65 % of these structurally conserved residues are also conserved in the fission yeast capping protein subunits , and (cid:2) 40 % of the corresponding residues are conserved in FH2 domains ( 43 % for Cdc12 ( FH2 ) p and 38 % for mDIA ( FH2 ) p ) . Given the structural similarity of the divergent (cid:9) and (cid:10) capping protein subunits and the presence of con - served residues between both capping protein subunits and FH2 domains , it is possible that two FH2 domains form a homodimeric capping protein . Further work is required to establish the extent , if any , of the structural homology be - tween capping proteins and formin FH2 domains . Profilin gates barbed end capping by formins Our evidence shows that formins are a special type of cap - ping protein that are gated by profilin . Formins cap the barbed end of actin filaments in the absence , but not in the presence , of profilin . As actin bound to profilin does not elongate pointed ends ( Pollard and Cooper , 1984 ; Kaiser et al . , 1999 ; confirmed here in Fig . 5 ) , and capping protein blocks barbed ends , profilin inhibits actin assembly in the presence of capping protein ( Fig . 8 C ) . Quite to the con - trary , profilin promotes spontaneous assembly of actin in the presence of Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p ( Fig . 8 C ) . In principle , pro - filin might increase either the efficiency of nucleation by formin ( Sagot et al . , 2002b ) or the rate of elongation after nucleation . on J une 27 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published June 9 , 2003 Th e J ou r n a l o f C e ll B i o l o gy Mechanism of actin nucleation by Cdc12p | Kovar et al . 885 TIRF microscopy revealed that profilin reverses the polar - ity of actin filament assembly driven by Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p ( Fig . 5 ) , so the filaments grow exclusively at their fast grow - ing barbed end with profilin and exclusively at their pointed ends without profilin . Given that each filament grows at least 15 times faster with profilin , and that the bulk poly - merization rate is only slightly faster with profilin than with Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p alone ( Fig . 8 A ) , profilin must inhibit nucleation by up to sixfold . Accordingly , filaments were at least three times longer with profilin and Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p than with Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p alone ( Fig . 8 , E – H ) , indicat - ing the production of at least threefold fewer filaments . Profilin also inhibits nucleation by budding yeast formin Bni1 ( FH1FH2 ) p ( Pring et al . , 2003 ) . Two mechanistic questions arise . First , how does profilin inhibit nucleation by formins ? The simplest hypothesis is that formins utilize spontane - ously formed actin dimers to form nuclei for pointed end growth . Profilin inhibits spontaneous actin nucleation , most likely the formation of dimers ( Pollard and Cooper , 1984 ) . Lacking these spontaneously assembled actin dimers , formin cannot start new filaments . More complicated mechanisms are possible , particularly because profilin must bind both FH1 and actin for its positive effects on assembly , whereas profilin lacking affinity for polyproline merely inhibits as - sembly . Thus , nucleation by profilin plus formin may in - volve a ternary complex that has yet to be characterized . Second , how does profilin reverse the direction of actin elongation in the presence of formin ? Explaining the lack of growth at the point end is simple , because an actin mono - mer with profilin bound to its barbed end cannot elongate the pointed end of an actin filament ( Pollard and Cooper , 1984 ) . The mechanism allowing elongation at the barbed end in the presence of formin is less clear . Most simply , pro - filin might dissociate formin from the barbed end . However , Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p inhibits annealing even in the presence of profilin ( Fig . 6 ) , suggesting that formins remain associ - ated with barbed ends . We suspect that bivalent binding of profilins to actin and FH1 contributes to opening the cap at the barbed end while blocking annealing , but the details re - main to be discovered . Doping annealing reactions with ad - ditional actin monomers did not allow profilin to overcome Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p inhibition of annealing ( unpublished data ) . Thus , profilin may allow barbed end elongation with the profilin – formin complex surfing at or near the barbed end like microtubule end binding proteins ( for review see Howard and Hyman , 2003 ) . Assembly of actin cables and contractile rings Formins and profilin are both implicated in contractile ring as - sembly in diverse organisms ( Balasubramanian et al . , 1994 ; Haugwitz et al . , 1994 ; Verheyen and Cooley , 1994 ; Chang et al . , 1997 ; Severson et al . , 2002 ; Tolliday et al . , 2002 ) and actin cables in yeast ( Feierbach and Chang , 2001b ; Evangelista et al . , 2002 ; Sagot et al . , 2002a ) . Temperature - sensitive mutants of fission yeast profilin ( cdc3 - 313 ) and Cdc12p ( cdc12 - 112 ) have synthetic lethal genetic interactions , and profilin binds the proline - rich formin ( FH1 ) p domain ( Chang et al . , 1997 ; Wasserman , 1998 ) . This argues that the two proteins operate on the same pathway , mostly likely through direct interaction . All of the available biochemical and biological evidence suggests that formins and profilin cooperate to assemble ac - tin filaments for contractile rings and cables . Localization of formins to the equator of mitotic cells before assembly of a contractile ring and to the buds before cable formation places them at the site of actin assembly . Given the abun - dance of profilin in most cells , the most likely mechanism is that formins overcome the inhibition of spontaneous nucle - ation by profilin and generate filaments that grow in the barbed direction . Many details remain to be resolved . In particular , we must still learn how formins can remain near the barbed ends of filaments ( for example in buds ; Ozaki - Kuroda et al . , 2001 ) as the filaments grow and whether con - tractile rings and cables consist of short overlapping fila - ments or long filaments . Given the opposite effects of profilin on actin filaments capped by Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p and capping protein in vitro , it is likely that formins and capping protein compete for ac - tin filament barbed ends in vivo . Consistent with this hy - pothesis , the overexpression of capping protein in fission yeast causes a specific lethal defect in cytokinesis , and cap - ping protein and cdc12 have an antagonistic genetic relation - ship ( unpublished data ) . It will be of considerable interest to understand how cells regulate the balance between capping protein – and formin - capped barbed ends depending on the necessity for rapid filament assembly . Materials and methods Strains , media , and electroporation Wild - type S . pombe strain FY436 ( KV25 ; h (cid:11) his7 - 366 ura4 - D18 leu1 - 32 ade6 - M216 ) and temperature - sensitive strain cdc12 - 112 ( KV145 ; h (cid:8) ade6 - M210 ura4 - D18 Leu1 - 32 ; Chang et al . , 1997 ) were used in this study . We used standard growth media ( YES rich medium and EMM minimal me - dium ) and methods for electroporation and molecular biology ( Sambrook et al . , 1989 ; Moreno et al . , 1991 ; Wu et al . , 2001 ) . Expression under the nmt1 promoter was regulated in EMM medium with the presence or ab - sence of 10 . 0 (cid:4) g / ml thiamine ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Plasmid construction A region of cdc12 containing the FH1 and FH2 domains ( residues 882 – 1375 ) was amplified from genomic DNA by high fidelity PCR ( Pfu ; Strat - agene ) and cloned into the vectors pGEX - 4T ( Amersham Biosciences ) for expression in Escherichia coli and pREP41 ( Maundrell , 1990 ) for expression in S . pombe . Inserts of the recombinant plasmids ( pGEX - cdc12 [ FH1FH2 ] and pREP41 - cdc12 [ FH1FH2 ] ) were sequenced to confirm fidelity of the PCR amplification . Microscopy of cells Cell morphology was observed by differential interference contrast ( DIC ) and epifluorescence microscopy . Images were collected with a cooled CCD camera ( Orca - ER ; Hamamatsu ) on an Olympus IX71 microscope with a 60X 1 . 4 NA Plan - apo objective . Nuclei and septa were stained by adding 0 . 1 volume of a 1 mg / ml stock ( in water ) of Hoechst ( bisBenzimide ; Sigma - Aldrich ) for 30 min . S . pombe were fixed for 2 min with 0 . 1 volume of 16 % formaldehyde ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) and permeabilized for 30 s with 1 % Nonidet P - 40 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) , and filamentous actin was stained with 7 . 5 (cid:4) g / ml rhodamine - phalloidin ( Fluka ) in DAPI mounting medium ( 50 % glycerol containing 1 mg / ml p - phenylelediamine [ Sigma - Aldrich ] and 1 (cid:4) g / ml DAPI [ Sigma - Aldrich ] in PBS ) for at least 6 h . We quantitated the ef - fects of Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p overexpression using at least two transformed strains analyzed on separate days . At least 300 cells were counted for each point . The culture density was kept between 0 . 1 and 0 . 5 ( OD 595 ) throughout the time course . We measured cell density , nuclei per cell ( DAPI ) , septal morphology ( Calcoflour , 1 mg / ml in water ) , and the presence of actomyosin rings ( pREP42 - GFP – cdc4 ; Balasubramanian et al . , 1997 ) . on J une 27 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published June 9 , 2003 Th e J ou r n a l o f C e ll B i o l o gy 886 The Journal of Cell Biology | Volume 161 , Number 5 , 2003 Protein purification Recombinant Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p was purified from the GST fusion protein construct similar to budding yeast Bni1p ( Pruyne et al . , 2002 ) . The pGEX - 4T - Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) construct was transformed into E . coli strain BL21 - Codon Plus ( DE3 ) - RP ( Stratagene ) and grown overnight at 37 (cid:3) C . After sub - culturing into fresh media , cells were grown at 30 (cid:3) C for 3 h and then induced for 24 h at 16 (cid:3) C with the addition of 0 . 5 mM isopropyl (cid:10) - D - thio - galactopyranoside . Cells harvested by centrifugation were frozen , resus - pended in extraction buffer ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , 200 mM NaCl , 10 % glycerol , and 5 mM DTT ) supplemented with a complete protease inhibi - tor tablet ( Roche ) , and sonicated . The sonicate was clarified at 30 , 000 and 50 , 000 g for 20 min each and loaded onto a 1 . 5 ml glutathione - Sepharose column ( Amersham Biosciences ) . After the column was washed with 15 bed volumes of wash buffer ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , 200 mM NaCl , 10 % glycerol , and 1 mM DTT ) , an additional 1 ml of wash buffer , supple - mented with 50 U of thrombin ( Amersham Biosciences ) , was added and incubated on a rocker for 16 h at 4 (cid:3) C . Thrombin - cleaved Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p was collected and dialyzed against Source Q - buffer ( 20 mM Tris , pH 8 . 5 , 25 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT , 5 % glycerol , and 0 . 01 % NaN 3 ) for 24 h at 4 (cid:3) C . Dialyzed protein was loaded onto a 1 - ml Source 15Q column ( Amersham Biosciences ) , washed with two column volumes , and then eluted with a 75 - ml linear gradient of 25 – 500 mM NaCl in Source Q - buffer . Pure Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p was dialyzed into buffer P ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , 1 mM EDTA , 50 mM KCl , 5 % glycerol , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 01 % NaN 3 ) . When stored on ice , Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p aggregated slowly and lost activity ( half life for activity was (cid:2) 2 wk ) . The activity of Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at (cid:11) 80 (cid:3) C appeared indistinguish - able from freshly purified protein . Therefore , we used freshly purified pro - tein stored on ice ( within 1 wk ) or protein stored at (cid:11) 80 (cid:3) C ( within 1 wk af - ter thawing ) for all experiments . Three independent batches of Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p gave similar results . Mouse capping protein (cid:9) 1 and (cid:10) 2 subunits ( Mm CP ) was purified from bacteria ( Palmgren et al . , 2001 ) . Wild - type and Y5D and K81E mutant S . pombe profilins were purified from bacteria ( Lu and Pollard , 2001 ) . Ca - ATP actin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle ( Spudich and Watt , 1971 ) and gel filtered on Sephacryl S - 300 in G buffer ( 2 mM Tris , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 2 mM ATP , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 , and 0 . 5 mM DTT ) to remove capping protein and oligomers . Actin was labeled on Cys - 374 with either pyre - nyliodoacetamide ( Molecular Probes ) ( Pollard , 1984 ) or a 12 - fold excess of Oregon green 488 iodoacetamide ( Molecular Probes ) . Actin was de - polymerized by dialysis against two changes of G buffer . Oregon green actin ( Ca - OG - actin ) was further purified by anion exchange chromatog - raphy on DE52 ( Whatman ) in G buffer with 5 mM Pipes - Tris , pH 6 . 5 , and eluted with a linear gradient of 0 – 300 mM KCl . Peak fractions were polymerized by dialysis overnight against 5 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 5 , 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgSO 4 , 0 . 5 mM EGTA , 0 . 3 mM ATP , 0 . 5 mM DTT , and 1 mM NaN 3 . The final purification step for both labeled actins was depo - lymerization by dialysis against G buffer and gel filtration on Sephacryl S - 300 . Protein concentrations were determined with extinction coefficients as follows : unlabeled actin , A 290 (cid:6) 26 , 600 M (cid:11) 1 cm (cid:11) 1 ( Houk and Ue , 1974 ) ; pyrene - actin , ( A 290 (cid:11) [ A 344 (cid:12) 0 . 127 ] ) (cid:12) 38 . 5 (cid:4) M ( Cooper et al . , 1983 ) ; Or - egon green actin , [ Total Ca - actin ] (cid:6) ( A 290 (cid:11) [ A 491 (cid:12) 0 . 16991 ] ) / 26 , 600 M (cid:11) 1 cm (cid:11) 1 , [ Ca - OG - actin ] (cid:6) A 491 / 77 , 800 M (cid:11) 1 cm (cid:11) 1 ; wild - type and mutant pro - filin , A 280 (cid:6) 1 . 63 OD mg (cid:11) 1 ml (cid:11) 1 ( Lu and Pollard , 2001 ) ; and Mm CP , A 280 (cid:6) 76 . 3 mM (cid:11) 1 cm (cid:11) 1 ( Palmgren et al . , 2001 ) . An extinction coefficient ( A 280 ) of 49 , 860 M (cid:11) 1 cm (cid:11) 1 for Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p was estimated with Prot - Param ( http : / / us . expasy . org / tools / ) from the amino acid composition . Fluorescence spectroscopy The concentration of polymerized actin was measured from the fluores - cence of a trace of pyrene - actin ( excitation at 365 nm and emission at 407 nm ) with a PTI Alphascan spectroflourimeter ( Photon Technology Interna - tional ) ( Higgs et al . , 1999 ) . For spontaneous polymerization assays , pyrene - labeled and unlabeled Ca - ATP actin monomers were mixed in G buffer to obtain a 20 (cid:4) M stock solution of either 5 % pyrene - actin or 2 % pyrene - actin for experiments with profilin . An aliquot of stock was con - verted to Mg - ATP actin by adding 0 . 1 volume of 10 mM EGTA and 1 mM MgCl 2 for 2 min at 25 (cid:3) C . Separate drops of Mg - ATP actin , other proteins , and 10 (cid:12) KMEI ( 500 mM KCl , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM EGTA , and 100 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 ) were placed on the side of a plastic Eppendorf tube . The reaction was started by mixing with G buffer – Mg ( G buffer with 0 . 1 mM MgCl 2 in place of 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 ) . For depolymerization assays ( Cald - well et al . , 1989 ) , a 5 (cid:4) M stock of 70 % pyrene F - actin was prepared and diluted to 0 . 1 (cid:4) M , in the presence of a range of concentrations of Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p or Mm CP with or without 5 (cid:4) M profilin , with the addi - tion of F buffer ( G buffer supplemented with 10 (cid:12) KMEI ) . The critical con - centration for actin assembly was determined two ways . First , a range of concentrations of Mg - ATP actin ( 5 % pyrene labeled ) was polymerized in the absence or presence of either 10 nM Mm CP or 100 nM Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p in F buffer for 16 h in the dark at 25 (cid:3) C . Second , a 5 (cid:4) M stock of 10 % pyrene F - actin was prepared and diluted to 1 . 0 (cid:4) M with F buffer , in the presence of a range of concentrations of Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p with or without 5 (cid:4) M profilin ( Caldwell et al . , 1989 ) . Reactions were incubated for at least 12 h in the dark at 25 (cid:3) C . Calculation of the concentration of apparent ends , [ Ends app ] , and depolymerization rates The concentration of apparent pointed ends , [ Ends app ] , was calculated from elongation rates using the equation [ Ends app ] (cid:6) elongation rate / ( k (cid:8) [ actin monomers ] ) , where k (cid:8) (cid:6) 0 . 8 (cid:4) M (cid:11) 1 s (cid:11) 1 at pH 7 . 0 , as previously described ( Higgs et al . , 1999 ) . As [ Ends app ] peaked when about one third of the 4 (cid:4) M G - actin had polymerized in the presence of Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p and Mm CP ( not depicted ) , we used the elongation rate at 2 . 4 (cid:4) M G - actin to calculate [ Ends app ] . In the presence of profilin , the concentration of ap - parent barbed ends , [ Ends app ] , was calculated where k (cid:8) (cid:6) 11 . 6 (cid:4) M (cid:11) 1 s (cid:11) 1 at pH 7 . 0 ( Pollard , 1986 ) . The yield of [ Ends app ] per capping molecule was calculated by dividing the [ Ends app ] by the concentration of Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p or Mm CP and subtracting the [ Ends app ] for actin alone . The rate of depolymerization was calculated by fitting the data from 300 – 1 , 000 s with a single exponential curve . Depolymerization rates in the presence of Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p or Mm CP were expressed as a percent normalized to the rate of actin alone . Microscopy of rhodamine - phalloidin – labeled filaments Products of polymerization were examined by fluorescence microscopy ( Blanchoin et al . , 2000 ) . Actin filaments were removed from polymeriza - tion assays and labeled by diluting 3 (cid:4) l of the reaction with 15 (cid:4) l of 1 (cid:4) M rhodamine - phalloidin ( Fluka ) in fluorescence buffer containing 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM DTT , 20 (cid:4) g / ml catalase , 100 (cid:4) g / ml glucose oxidase , 3 mg / ml glucose , 0 . 5 % methylcellulose , 10 mM imidazole , pH 7 . 0 , for 5 min . After diluting with an additional 500 (cid:4) l of fluorescence buffer , 2 (cid:4) l was applied to coverslips coated with 0 . 05 (cid:4) g / (cid:4) L poly - L - lysine , and fluorescence images were collected with a cooled CCD cam - era ( Orca - ER ) on an Olympus 1X - 71 microscope . Actin filament annealing Annealing ( Andrianantoandro et al . , 2001 ) was examined by polymerizing 4 (cid:4) M Mg - ATP actin in the presence of either 6 (cid:4) M rhodamine - or 6 (cid:4) M Alexa ® green – phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) for 1 h . Equal volumes of red and green filaments ( 0 . 5 (cid:4) M total final actin filament concentration ) and Mm CP , Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p , or profilin were mixed in F buffer , sheared by pushing eight times through a 3 / 8 - inch 26 - gauge needle on a 1 . 0 - ml tuber - culin syringe , and allowed to anneal for 60 min at room temperature . Re - actions were terminated by a 250 - fold dilution in fluorescence buffer , ab - sorbed to coverslips coated with poly - L - lysine , and imaged as described above . The number of annealing events per filament was determined by dividing the total number of red and green transitions within a population of filaments by the total number of those filaments . TIRF microscopy TIRF microscopy was performed using the methods of Amann and Pollard ( 2001 ) using Oregon green – labeled Mg - ATP actin ( 25 – 30 % labeled ) as a tracer and 0 . 0002 % of 0 . 2 - (cid:4) m crimson fluorescent beads ( Molecular Probes ) as autofocusing targets . Images were collected with a cooled CCD camera ( Orca - ER ) using custom software that automatically focused on flu - orescent beads via epifluorescence and corrected time - lapse TIRF movies for drift . A maximum intensity projection revealed movement - constricted NEM - myosin attachment points of individual filaments that we used as fi - ducial marks to separate the barbed and pointed ends for length measure - ments . Filament lengths were calculated from 370 subunits / (cid:4) m . Polymer - ization rates were estimated from plots of change in length versus change in time for the entire population of filaments using a robust - MM linear re - gression algorithm of S - Plus ( Insightful Corp . ) . To quantify total filament content , long filaments were traced and mea - sured by hand . Hand - traced filaments were masked out of the image , a threshold was applied to the remaining pixels , and particle area , A , and perimeter , P , were scored . Particles with a circularity of 4 (cid:13) A / P 2 (cid:2) 0 . 5 were discarded , and the remaining particle lengths were calculated from P / 4 P / 4 ( ) 2 A – . + on J une 27 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published June 9 , 2003 Th e J ou r n a l o f C e ll B i o l o gy Mechanism of actin nucleation by Cdc12p | Kovar et al . 887 Online supplemental material The supplemental material ( available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200211078 / DC1 ) contains figures showing a diagram of the model for the mechanism of nucleation by Cdc12 ( FH1FH2 ) p in the presence of profi - lin , and alignments of capping protein (cid:9) and (cid:10) subunits with FH2 domains .
