A RT I C L E S Inhibition of Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization by PICK1 regulates neuronal morphology and AMPA receptor endocytosis Daniel L . Rocca 1 , Stéphane Martin 1 , Emma L . Jenkins 1 and Jonathan G . Hanley 1 , 2 The dynamic regulation of actin polymerization plays crucial roles in cell morphology and endocytosis . The mechanistic details of these processes and the proteins involved are not fully understood , especially in neurons . PICK1 is a PDZ – BAR - domain protein involved in regulated AMPA receptor ( AMPAR ) endocytosis in neurons . Here , we demonstrate that PICK1 binds filamentous ( F ) - actin and the actin - nucleating Arp2 / 3 complex , and potently inhibits Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization . RNA interference ( RNAi ) knockdown of PICK1 in neurons induces a reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton resulting in aberrant cell morphology . Wild - type PICK1 rescues this phenotype , but a mutant PICK1 , PICK1 W413A , that does not bind or inhibit Arp2 / 3 has no effect . Furthermore , this mutant also blocks NMDA - induced AMPAR internalization . This study identifies PICK1 as a negative regulator of Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization that is critical for a specific form of vesicle trafficking , and also for the development of neuronal architecture . The dynamic actin cytoskeleton plays multiple roles in eukaryotic cells to regulate cell morphology , cell motility and vesicle trafficking by exert - ing mechanical forces that alter the shape of the plasma membrane . The Arp2 / 3 complex is the major catalyst for the formation of branched actin networks that mediate changes in membrane geometry . Proteins such as N - WASP , WAVE and cortactin bind and activate the Arp2 / 3 complex so that changes in cell morphology or vesicle trafficking occur at appropri - ate times and subcellular locations 1 – 3 . Regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is crucial for neuronal mor - phogenesis 1 , 4 , 5 . Recent reports have suggested a role for the Arp2 / 3 activator N - WASP in neurite elongation and branching in neuronal development 6 , 7 ; however , negative regulators of the Arp2 / 3 complex in these processes have not yet been identified . A role for Arp2 / 3 - medi - ated actin dynamics in the regulation of endocytosis in mammalian cell lines is becoming increasingly well established . Localized altera - tions in actin turnover are proposed to provide mechanical forces that contribute to plasma membrane curvature , vesicle scission and propulsion of nascent vesicles away from the membrane 2 , 8 – 10 . The spe - cific molecular mechanisms for regulating actin to control endocyto - sis in neurons are unknown . Dendritic spines , the sites of excitatory synapses in neurons , are particularly enriched in F - actin 11 – 13 , which is extremely dynamic , rapidly cycling between globular ( G ) - actin and F - actin 14 . As designated endocytic sites are found in dendritic spines 15 , 16 , it seems likely that the densely packed , dynamic actin fila - ments influence endocytosis . PICK1 is a PDZ - and BAR - domain - containing protein that binds to a number of membrane proteins , including AMPAR subunits GluR2 / 3 . This interaction is required for AMPAR internalization in response to Ca 2 + influx via NMDAR activation in hippocampal neurons 17 – 21 . This is a major mechanism that underlies the reduc - tion in synaptic strength in long - term depression ( LTD ) , which is thought to play a role in learning and memory 20 , 21 . The precise molecular mechanisms for the action of PICK1 in receptor endo - cytosis are unclear . Here , we demonstrate that PICK1 is an inhibitor of Arp2 / 3 - medi - ated actin assembly . This regulation is required for the organization of the actin cytoskeleton to establish appropriate neuronal morphology . Furthermore , we demonstrate that inhibition of Arp2 / 3 activity by PICK1 is required for NMDA - induced AMPAR endocytosis . RESULTS PICK1 binds actin As certain proteins with BAR - like domains are involved in actin regulation 22 – 24 , we asked whether PICK1 interacts with actin . Coimmunoprecipitations from neuronal extracts demonstrate the presence of a PICK1 – actin – GluR2 complex ( Fig . 1a ) . Actin - binding proteins may associate with G - actin or F - actin ; therefore , we ana - lysed which form binds to PICK1 . In pulldown assays , GST – PICK1 does not bind G - actin ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1 ) . To investigate F - actin binding , actin sedimentation assays were 1 MRC Centre for Synaptic Plasticity , Department of Anatomy , School of Medical Sciences , University of Bristol , University Walk , Bristol BS8 1TD , UK . 2 Correspondence should be addressed to J .

PICK1 binds the Arp2 / 3 complex PICK1 contains an acidic region ( D 380 GEDEEEEEED 390 ) and a tryptophan residue ( Trp 413 ) , resembling Arp2 / 3 activators ( Fig . 1d ) . A pulldown assay using GST – PICK1 and purified Arp2 / 3 complex indicated that these proteins can interact directly ( Fig . 1e ) , and coimmunoprecipitations from neuronal extracts demonstrated an interaction between Arp2 / 3 , PICK1 and GluR2 in native tissue ( Fig . 1f ) . PICK1 is known to be loosely associated with the postsynaptic density ( PSD ) 25 . Both PICK1 and Arp2 / 3 were found in PSD fractions I and II purified from brain synaptosomes ( Fig . 1g ) . Furthermore , PICK1 and Arp2 / 3 colocalized at PSD - 95 immu - nopositive synaptic sites in a subset of hippocampal neurons ( Fig . 1h ) . PICK1 inhibits Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization In vitro pyrene - labelled actin polymerization assays were used to investigate regulation of the Arp2 / 3 complex by PICK1 . PICK1 did not stimulate Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization , in contrast to the N - WASP VCA domain 26 ( Fig . 2a ) . Surprisingly , PICK1 reduced the rate of VCA - stimulated Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin assembly in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 2b ) . PICK1 – Flag purified from neurons had similar inhibitory activity ( Fig . 2c ; see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1 ) . Coimmunoprecipitation from transfected COS cells showed that PICK1 and N - WASP VCA did not interact ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1 ) , indicating that PICK1 is not inhibiting VCA by direct interaction . Therefore , we asked whether PICK1 could compete with VCA for binding to the Arp2 / 3 complex . When PICK1 was present , VCA was displaced from the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 2d ) , suggesting that PICK1 and VCA compete for the same binding site F l u o r e s ce n ce ( a . u . ) Time ( s ) 40 30 20 10 50 37 50 37 F l u o r e s ce n ce ( a . u . ) 40 30 20 10 0 0 F l u o r e s ce n ce ( a . u . ) 40 30 20 10 0 F l u o r e s ce n ce ( a . u . ) R e l a t i v e V C A b i n d i n g 16 12 8 4 0 0 500 1000 1500 Time ( s ) 0 200 400 600 800 Time ( s ) Time ( s ) 0 0 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 0 – + 200 500 1000 400 600 800 a d e b c M r ( K ) Actin alone Actin alone + Arp2 / 3 + Arp2 / 3 + PICK1 Actin + Arp2 / 3 + VCA Actin + Arp2 / 3 + VCA Actin + Arp2 / 3 Actin + Arp2 / 3 + Arp2 / 3 + PICK1 PICK1 PICK1 + 100 nM PICK1 PICK1 – Flag + 250 nM + 400 nM + 1 µM + Control + Arp2 / 3 + PICK1 + Arp2 / 3 + VCA * * IP : p34 – + GST – VCA PICK1 p34 Figure 2 PICK1 inhibits VCA and Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization .

After washing of beads , proteins were detected by immunoblotting .

A high concentration of Arp2 / 3 complex has some actin - nucleating activity , even in the absence of VCA 27 . PICK1 inhibited actin assembly stimulated by 100 nM Arp2 / 3 complex without VCA ( Fig . 2e ) , suggesting that PICK1 can directly disrupt the nucleating activity of Arp2 / 3 . These data demonstrate that PICK1 reduces the rate of actin assem - bly by two distinct mechanisms : first , by disrupting VCA – Arp2 / 3 interactions and second , by inhibiting the nucleating activity of Arp2 / 3 directly . Trp 413 is required for Arp2 / 3 binding to PICK1 and inhibition of actin polymerization We analysed the PICK1 sequence requirements for Arp2 / 3 binding using PICK1 truncation mutants . The minimal region for Arp2 / 3 interaction comprised amino acids 280 – 416 ( ∆280 ; Fig . 3a ) . The C - terminal tryp - tophan in full - length PICK1 was mutated to alanine ( W413A ) . This single amino - acid substitution eliminated Arp2 / 3 binding ( Fig . 3b ) . As expected , GluR2 C - terminus bound equally well to both PICK1 W413A and wild - type PICK1 ( Fig . 3b ) .

S1 ) . Consistent with an inability to bind Arp2 / 3 , PICK1 W413A did not compete with VCA domain for Arp2 / 3 binding ( Fig . 3c ) . In actin polymerization assays PICK1 W413A had no effect on VCA - stimulated Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin assembly ( Fig . 3d ) , demonstrating that Arp2 / 3 binding is an absolute requirement for the inhibitory effect of PICK1 on actin polymerization . Lys 251 and Lys 252 are required for actin binding and inhibition of actin polymerization PICK1 was shown to bind actin via the BAR domain ( Fig . 1 ) . To inves - tigate a precise actin - binding motif , a double lysine motif ( KK251 , 252 ) that is similar to the F - actin binding motif in pan1p was analysed 28 . Mutating Lys 251 and Lys 252 in GST – PICK1 BAR domain to glutamate ( KK251 , 252EE ) abolished F - actin binding ( Fig . 3e ) . In actin polymeriza - tion assays , PICK1 KK251 , 252EE had no effect on VCA - stimulated Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin assembly ( Fig . 3f ) , demonstrating that actin binding is required for the inhibition of actin polymerization by PICK1 . In agree - ment with previous studies 29 , 30 , the KK251 , 252EE mutation also inhibited PICK1 – lipid vesicle interactions ; however , Arp2 / 3 binding was unaf - fected by this mutation ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1 ) . Regulation of Arp2 / 3 complex by PICK1 is critical for maintaining the neuronal actin cytoskeleton To analyse the role of PICK1 in regulating the neuronal actin cytoskel - eton , short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) constructs were designed to reduce PICK1 expression in hippocampal neurons . The constructs coexpressed mCherry fluorescent protein under the control of the neuronal CamKII promoter . PICK1 shRNA resulted in efficient PICK1 knockdown in transfected COS cells ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S2 ) , and in hippocampal neurons ( Fig . 4a ) . In addition , neurons transfected with PICK1 shRNA at 9 – 10 DIV showed a dramatic change in mor - phology 5 days later ( Fig . 4a ) . Neurons transfected at 13 – 14 DIV were more resistant to these morphological changes ( Fig . 5 ) . Sholl analysis of neurons transfected at 10 DIV revealed a significant increase in the number of processes close to the cell body ( at 10 and 20 µm radii ) and significantly fewer distal processes ( at 80 – 120 µm radii ) compared with controls ( Fig . 4b ) . CamKII staining confirmed that all transfected cells were indeed neurons ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S2 ) . The subcellular localizations of GluR2 and Arp2 / 3 were altered in PICK1 shRNA - transfected neurons ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S2 ) . Cotransfection of an shRNA - resistant wild - type PICK1 construct carry - ing silent mutations rescued neuronal morphology , confiming that the RNAi effect was indeed a direct result of PICK1 knockdown . In striking contrast , PICK1 W413A did not rescue shRNA - induced changes ( Fig . 4c , d ) . These experiments suggest that inhibition of Arp2 / 3 by PICK1 is required for correct neuronal morphology , and that the morphologi - cal changes that occur after PICK1 knockdown are due to over activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex . To investigate this further , the CA domain of N - WASP was used to inhibit Arp2 / 3 ( ref . 31 ) in neurons with reduced PICK1 levels . Expression of N - WASP – CA reduced the aberrant proximal branching , but did not rescue the effects on distal processes ( Fig . 4c , d ) . Interestingly , cotransfection of PICK1 shRNA with shRNA - resist - ant PICK1 KK251 , 252EE , which does not bind F - actin , had an intermediate effect , and only partially rescued the aberrant proximal branching . Overexpressing each of these PICK1 constructs on a control mCherry background had no significant effect on gross neuronal morphology ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S3 ) . To directly analyse the effect of PICK1 on the neuronal actin cytoskeleton , fluorophore - conjugated phalloidin was used to visualize F - actin in shRNA - transfected neurons . In neurons transfected with control plasmids , F - actin was found to be concentrated in dendritic spines and the cell periphery , as previously demonstrated 11 – 13 . Five days after transfection with PICK1 shRNA , F - actin had an altered distribution , correlating with the aberrant morphol - ogy ( Fig . 4e ) . Furthermore , the total phalloidin staining was significantly higher , providing additional evidence that PICK1 functions as an inhibi - tor of actin polymerization in neurons . Cotransfection with shRNA - resistant wild - type PICK1 , but not PICK1 W413A , rescued the RNAi effects on the actin cytoskeleton ( Fig . 4e ) . To investigate whether the increased branching close to the cell body represents bona fide dendritic branching , anti - MAP2 immunocyto - chemistry was performed on control and PICK1 shRNA - transfected neurons . Sholl analysis of the MAP2 immunofluorescence demonstrated that there was an increase in proximal dendritic branching in PICK1 shRNA - transfected cells compared with controls ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S4 ) . Qualitative analysis indicated that not all processes induced by PICK1 knockdown were MAP2 - positive ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S4 ) , suggesting that not all aberrant actin - based pro - trusions result in the formation of a dendrite . Inhibition of Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization by PICK1 is required for NMDA - induced AMPAR endocytosis As PICK1 is crucial for regulated AMPAR endocytosis 17 – 21 , 29 , 32 , we asked whether the inhibition of actin polymerization via PICK1 – Arp2 / 3 inter - actions provides a driving force for receptor trafficking . Given that aber - rant neuronal morphology might in itself affect trafficking events , an alternative approach was used to study AMPAR trafficking . Neurons transfected at 13 – 14 DIV were more resistant to morphological changes compared with those transfected at 9 – 10 DIV ( Fig . 5a ) . A ‘chemical LTD’ protocol was used , whereby NMDARs are activated by bath application of NMDA to induce AMPAR internalization 19 , 29 , 33 . Antibody - feeding immunocytochemistry was performed at 18 DIV on cultured hippoc - ampal neurons transfected at 13 DIV to quantify the degree of internali - zation of GluR2 occurring in response to NMDA treatment . Control neurons showed a twofold increase in GluR2 endocytosis in response to NMDA , which was completely blocked in PICK1 shRNA - transfected neurons ( Fig . 5b ) . Neurons cotransfected with PICK1 shRNA and shRNA - resistant wild - type PICK1 exhibited restored NMDA - induced AMPAR endocytosis . However , in neurons cotransfected with PICK1 shRNA and PICK1 W413A , NMDA - induced AMPAR endocytosis was com - pletely abolished ( Fig . 5c ) . To provide further evidence that PICK – Arp2 / 3 interactions are required for regulated AMPAR internalization , we also employed a dominant - negative approach . As demonstrated before , overexpres - sion of wild - type PICK1 enhanced NMDA - induced AMPAR endo - cytosis compared with EGFP - expressing controls 19 . In stark contrast , PICK1 W413A blocked NMDA - induced internalization of GluR2 - contain - ing AMPARs ( Fig . 6a ) . Overexpression of neither protein influenced transferrin receptor internalization ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S5 ) . As NMDA - induced AMPAR endocytosis was blocked by a PICK1 mutant that was unable to inhibit actin polymerization , we asked whether this block could be reversed by pharmacological inhibition nature cell biology volume 10 | number 3 | mArCH 2008 265 © 2008 Nature Publishing Group A RT I C L E S EGFP E G F P Surface GluR2 I n t e r n a li z e d G l u R 2 EGFP Surface GluR2 I n t e r n a li z e d G l u R 2 W T W 413 A N M D A – W 413 A L a t B – E G F P L a t B – – – N M D A N M D A + – + – Lat B G l u R 2 i n t e r n a li z a t i o n i n d e x 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 1 0 * * W413A EGFP + NMDA n . s . + – + – NMDA G l u R 2 i n t e r n a li z a t i o n i n d e x 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 1 0 * * * * EGFP CA n . s . + – + – NMDA G l u R 2 i n t e r n a li z a t i o n i n d e x 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 2 0 * * * * * EGFP WT + – W413A a b c Figure 6 Inhibition of Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization by PICK1 is required for NMDA - induced AMPAR endocytosis in neurons .

To provide additional evidence that inhibition of the Arp2 / 3 complex is required for AMPAR internalization , AMPAR internalization was assayed in neurons expressing the N - WASP CA domain , which inhibits the endogenous Arp2 / 3 complex 31 . Inhibition of actin polymerization by CA domain expression resulted in increased basal AMPAR internalization , which occluded the NMDA - induced increase in endocytosis ( Fig . 6c ) . We also performed internalization assays in COS cells expressing GluR2 – Myc and wild - type PICK1 or PICK1 W413A . Wild - type PICK1 mediates robust GluR2 internalization 19 . In contrast , GluR2 endocyto - sis in PICK1 W413A - expressing cells was similar to levels in the absence of PICK1 ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S5 ) , indicating that interac - tions with Arp2 / 3 are required for PICK1 - mediated GluR2 endocytosis . Interestingly , latrunculin treatment had a different effect in COS cells compared with neurons , and resulted in reduced levels of GluR2 endo - cytosis in both wild - type and PICK1 W413A - transfected cells . This suggests differences in actin - based endocytic mechanisms between neurons and COS cells . Taken together , these data demonstrate that the inhibition of Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization by PICK1 is required for the NMDA - induced endocytosis of GluR2 - containing AMPARs in neurons . Interaction with GluR2 C - terminus enhances inhibition of Arp2 / 3 complex by PICK1 The dual role for PICK1 – Arp2 / 3 interactions in AMPAR trafficking and cell morphology suggests that PICK1 may tonically inhibit the Arp2 / 3 complex , yet provide an enhanced , localized and transient inhibition to drive AMPAR endocytosis . Therefore , we investigated the possibility that the inhibition of actin polymerization by PICK1 is regulated by interact - ing with GluR2 . The PDZ domain forms an intramolecular interaction with the BAR domain , inhibiting non - PDZ interactions with additional proteins . This conformation is disrupted by binding of a PDZ ligand , exposing the BAR domain / C - terminal region to additional interactors 29 ( also see Supplementary Information , Fig . S6 ) . As actin and Arp2 / 3 complex bind non - PDZ regions of PICK1 , we asked whether the GluR2 C - terminus ( R2C ) could modulate F - actin and Arp2 / 3 binding by alter - ing the conformation of PICK1 . Addition of R2C resulted in significant increases in PICK1 – actin and PICK1 – Arp2 / 3 interactions ( Fig . 7a , b ) . These results suggest that GluR2 binding might enhance the inhibitory effect of PICK1 on Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin assembly . As predicted , R2C dramatically enhanced the inhibition of actin polymerization by PICK1 , resulting in nearly complete blockade of actin assembly ( Fig . 7c ) . As the proposed mechanism for this allosteric modulation is dis - placement of the PDZ domain from the BAR domain , we analysed the binding of F - actin and Arp2 / 3 to PICK1 with the PDZ domain deleted ( PICK1 ∆105 ) . Arp2 / 3 binding to PICK1 was enhanced by PDZ deletion ( Fig . 7d ) . Consistent with this , we demonstrated that binding to F - actin was also enhanced by PDZ deletion ( Fig . 1e ) . Furthermore , PICK1 ∆105 competed with VCA for Arp2 / 3 binding much more efficiently than wild - type PICK1 ( Fig . 7e ) . Adding purified PDZ domain ( PICK1 135∆ ) to PICK1 ∆105 inhibited binding to both actin and Arp2 / 3 , confirming an allosterically regulated interaction with PICK1 ( Fig . 7f , g ) . Consistent with these observations , PDZ domain deletion potentiated the inhibition of actin polymerization by PICK1 ( Fig . 7h ) . Adding the free PDZ domain ( PICK1 135∆ ) to this reaction reduced the inhibition of actin assembly by PICK1 ∆105 ( Fig . 7h ) , confirming that the intramolecular interaction between the PDZ domain and the BAR domain plays a crucial role in controlling the inhibition of actin polymerization by PICK1 . We then investigated the effect of PDZ - deletion of PICK1 in hippocampal neu - rons .

( a ) In the absence of receptor cargo , PICK1 maintains a low - level tonic inhibition of actin polymerization , sufficient to prevent inappropriate membrane protrusions that would occur as a result of high levels of F - actin assembly . Treadmilling cortical actin restricts invaginations by maintaining membrane tension . ( b ) When GluR2 binds PICK1 , PICK1 – actin and PICK1 – Arp2 / 3 interactions are enhanced and actin polymerization is locally inhibited . Actin depolymerization continues at these sites , resulting in a net loss of F - actin around the nascent coated pit . The resulting reduction in membrane tension allows the membrane to invaginate . Clathrin and associated coat proteins and the BAR domain of PICK1 may contribute to membrane curvature . 268 nature cell biology volume 10 | number 3 | mArCH 2008 © 2008 Nature Publishing Group A RT I C L E S in PICK1 shRNA treated neurons to a greater extent than wild - type PICK1 ( Fig . 7i ) , suggesting that PDZ deletion enhances the influence of PICK1 on the actin cytoskeleton in neurons . PICK1 135∆ did not rescue neuronal morphology , presumably because this protein does not bind actin or Arp2 / 3 . These data show that the PICK1 – R2C complex has a greater effect on reducing actin assembly compared with PICK1 alone , providing a mechanism for regulating PICK1 so that it is less active when the PDZ domains are unoccupied , and maximally active when bound to AMPARs . DISCUSSION Here , we describe a molecular mechanism for regulating neuronal actin dynamics by PICK1 . PICK1 binds F - actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex , and inhibits Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin assembly activated by the N - WASP VCA domain . This mechanism has two distinct roles in neuronal function ; first , it is critical for development of neuronal morphology , and second , it is required for stimulated AMPAR endocytosis . Our data demonstrate that constitutive inhibition of Arp2 / 3 - medi - ated actin polymerization by PICK1 is required to establish appropri - ate neuronal morphology . One of the characteristics of neurons with reduced PICK1 expression is an increase in projections from the cell body and proximal dendrites . This effect is reversed by inhibition of Arp2 / 3 activity , confirming that PICK1 prevents aberrant actin - based branching by suppressing Arp2 / 3 activity . A second morphological effect of PICK1 knockdown is a reduction in neurite length . This is con - sistent with previous reports demonstrating a requirement for Arp2 / 3 inhibition in neurite elongation 31 . However , inhibition of Arp2 / 3 activ - ity by N - WASP – CA does not rescue neurite length , suggesting that alternative specific properties of PICK1 protein are involved in dendrite outgrowth . It has been shown that PICK1 is involved in regulation of growth cone function via a PDZ domain interaction with the netrin - 1 receptor UNC5 ( ref . 35 ) . This is consistent with our observation that PDZ - deleted PICK1 does not rescue the distal effects of PICK1 knock - down as efficiently as wild - type PICK1 . The morphological effects of PICK1 knockdown seem to be restricted to immature neurons , sug - gesting that following a certain developmental period , PICK1 is less critical for maintaining appropriate gross morphology of the dendritic arborization . Further studies are required to investigate the precise role of PICK1 in neuronal development . Recent studies have defined a role for actin dynamics in endocytosis in mammalian cell lines 2 , 8 – 10 . It has been proposed that actin polymeriza - tion occurs around the nascent endocytic vesicle to provide mechanical forces for late stages of invagination and vesicle scission . Actin assem - bly occurring early and directly at the nascent coated pit may create forces to oppose membrane invagination 2 ( Fig . 8 ) . Therefore , the initial invagination of the plasma membrane would require a phase of reduced F - actin , which may be followed by a highly localized , restricted burst of actin polymerization around the neck of the coated pit to drive scission and subsequent propulsion away from the plasma membrane 2 , 10 . In fact , actin assembly at clathrin - coated pits in fibroblasts has been observed as a transient late event , following clathrin and dynamin recruitment by several seconds , suggesting that the early induction of membrane curva - ture occurs under conditions of low F - actin 36 , 37 . We propose that PICK1 functions to inhibit actin assembly at endocytic sites until membrane invagination has been initiated ( Fig . 8 ) . Although consistent with previous studies 34 , which demonstrated that depolymerization is the important shift in actin dynamics to trig - ger AMPAR endocytosis , two of our results were surprising to us : the reversal of the PICK1 W413A - mediated block of AMPAR endocytosis by the actin depolymerizing drug latrunculin and the enhanced basal AMPAR endocytosis following Arp2 / 3 inhibition by N - WASP CA domain . Both suggest that assembly of actin filaments may be less impor - tant for AMPAR internalization than proposed for endocytic events in non - neuronal cells , and that the high density of F - actin in dendritic spines may be the dominant factor that constrains AMPAR traffick - ing . Although the CA domain enhances basal trafficking that occludes NMDA - induced internalization , overexpression of wild - type PICK1 has no impact on basal trafficking , but instead enhances the NMDA effect . This difference between the two Arp2 / 3 inhibitors is likely to reflect the Ca 2 + - sensitivity of PICK1 . In the absence of NMDAR activation , PICK1 binds weakly to GluR2 and therefore does not influence AMPAR traf - ficking 19 . Presumably PICK1 only inhibits Arp2 / 3 strongly enough to drive AMPAR internalization when bound to GluR2 . In contrast , the CA domain inhibits Arp2 / 3 potently and ubiquitously enough to influence receptor trafficking , with no dependence on Ca 2 + signals or additional protein interactions . As the BAR domain binds lipid membranes 30 and may be involved in generating membrane curvature 22 , 38 , 39 , inhibition of Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymerization by PICK1 could contribute to membrane bending by reducing membrane tension and the rigidity of the cortical actin – plasma membrane module 39 . The KK251 , 252 motif that we identify as the actin - binding site on PICK1 has previously been implicated in medi - ating the binding of the BAR domain to phospholipid membranes 29 , 30 , an observation that we confirm in this study . This strengthens the hypothe - sis that membrane bending is linked to actin - based processes via PICK1 . Other proteins with BAR - like domains also have lysine - based motifs that mediate interactions with both phospholipids and F - actin 40 . The dual role of the PICK1 – Arp2 / 3 interaction in both trafficking and in the constitutive maintenance of the actin cytoskeleton may depend upon the PDZ - regulated allosteric switch . Under basal conditions , PICK1 PDZ domains may be unoccupied , resulting in a low , tonic level of Arp2 / 3 regulation that contributes to the development of neuronal morphology . NMDAR - mediated Ca 2 + influx stimulates the interaction of GluR2 with the PICK1 PDZ domain 19 , resulting in enhanced interactions with F - actin and with Arp2 / 3 and , thus , enhanced inhibition of actin polymerization specifically at the site of AMPAR endocytosis ( see Fig . 8 ) . This provides a mechanism for ensuring a tight temporal and spatial synchronization of cargo recruitment and membrane invagination . We have identified PICK1 as a novel regulator of the actin cytoskel - eton in neurons . This work provides important mechanistic informa - tion about the modulation of the neuronal cytoskeleton and highlights PICK1 as a key molecule linking the fundamental cellular processes of cytoskeletal remodelling and protein traffic .

Actin polymerization assays . Lyophilized pyrene - labelled rabbit muscle actin ( Cytoskeleton ) at 5 µM in buffer A was centrifuged at 70 , 000 g in a Ti70 . 1 rotor ( Beckman ) for 1 h at 4 ºC to remove potential oligomers or actin filaments in the solution . Following centrifugation , supernatants were allowed to adjust to room temperature for 1 h before commencing the assay . Calcium bound to pyrene - actin monomers was pre - exchanged with magnesium by incubating with 0 . 1 volumes of 10× ME buffer ( 500 µM MgCl 2 , 2 mM EGTA ) for 2 min before the addition of polymerization buffer . Unless otherwise indicated , polymerization reactions contained 2 . 5 µM pyrene - actin , 25 nM purified Arp2 / 3 , 100 nM GST – VCA and various concentrations of His 6 – PICK1 ( wild type and mutants ) or His 6 – R2C made up to a total volume of 300 µl using buffer A . Polymerization was initiated by the addition of polymerization buffer to a final concentration of 50 mM KCl , 10 mM Tris at pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 2 mM DTT , 2 mM MgCl 2 and 1 mM ATP ( along with the other constituents ) to the Ca – Mg exchanged pyrene - actin followed by extensive tritura - tion . Reactions were immediately transferred to a fine quartz cuvette and fluores - cence data collected in a Spex Fluoromax fluorimeter at an excitation wavelength of 365 nm and emission wavelength of 386 nm at a constant 25 ºC . Fluorescence data was collected for 800 – 1500 s and all experiments were carried out at least three times with similar results . Note that the fluorimeter and the xenon - arc lamp were allowed to warm up 1 h prior to performing the assays to ensure stable signal strength . To minimize photobeaching and to limit signal – noise ratio the excitation slits were set to a minimal 0 . 1 value . Moreover , to avoid Schlieren lines , samples were extensively triturated in the quartz cuvette and all stock solutions filtered . Cuvettes were also thoroughly washed with ddH 2 0 and dried between each run to remove actin oligomers . Pyrene - labelled actin , GST – WASP VCA and Arp2 / 3 complex were purchased from Cytoskeleton Inc . Competition assays . Purified Arp2 / 3 complex was immunoprecipitated with 2 µg anti - p34 antibody immobilized on protein A beads ( Sigma ) . After one wash with XB buffer , immunocomplexes were incubated with 100 nM GST – VCA with or without 500 nM His 6 - tagged wild - type PICK1 or mutants for 1 h . Beads were then washed twice in XB and proteins detected by immunoblotting . Quantification of SDS – PAGE and immunoblots . Films of immunoblots from at least three independent experiments were scanned and analysed using Image J . Error bars represent s . e . m . and two - tailed t - tests were carried out to determine significant differences . Immunocytochemistry . For trafficking experiments , live hippocampal neurons prepared from E18 wistar rats ( 15 – 20 DIV ) , treated with fluorodeoxyuridine and uridine to inhibit glial growth , and then were surface labelled with anti - GluR2 ( 30 µg ml – 1 ) for 30 mins at room temperature in HBS plus 2 µM TTX . After two washes in HBS , neurons were treated with 50 µM NMDA for 3 min at 37 °C , followed by 9 min after drug washout . Neurons were fixed for 5 min with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) and stained with anti - mouse Cy5 secondary . Following 15 min fixation in PFA , cells were permeabilized and stained with anti - mouse Cy3 or Alexa 350 secondary . For simple staining experiments , neurons were fixed in PFA , permeabilized and stained with appropriate antibodies or Alexa - conjugated phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) . Transferrin receptor - endocytosis assays were carried out as previously described 41 using Alexa - conjugated transferrin . Images were acquired on a LSM510 confocal microscope ( Zeiss ) and analysed using ImageJ software . Quantification of internalized GluR2 was carried out by threshold - ing the EGFP or mCherry fluorescence signal in ImageJ to define outlines of neurons , and the ratio of internalized over total ( surface + internalized ) mean GluR2 fluorescence within this area was calculated . Quantification of PICK1 and phalloidin staining was carried out by thresholding the mCherry fluorescence signal in ImageJ to define outlines of neurons , and the mean intensity fluorescence signal for PICK1 or phalloidin quantified within this area . Sholl analysis of hippocampal neurons . Neurons were transfected at 9 – 10 DIV using Lipofectamine 2000 , and analysed 5 days later . Intensity thresholds of mCherry or EGFP fluorescence or MAP2 immunofluorescence signal were set in Image J , concentric circles with 10 µm differences in radius were drawn around the cell body , and the number of processes crossing each circle was counted . Lipid - binding assays . Lipid - binding assays were carried out as previously described 30 , 38 . Brain lipid extracts ( Folch extract I ; Sigma ) were resuspended in 20 mM HEPES at pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT . GST - fusion proteins 270 nature cell biology volume 10 | number 3 | mArCH 2008 © 2008 Nature Publishing Group A RT I C L E S ( 2 . 5 µM ) were then incubated with 1 mg ml – 1 lipid extract for 15 min at 37 º C before high - speed centrifugation at 35 , 000 g for 15 min in a Beckman Ti70 . 1 rotor . Supernatant and pellet protein samples were then resolved by SDS – PAGE and visualised by Coomassie staining . Note : Supplementary Information is available on the Nature Cell Biology website .

( b ) Schematic depicting PICK1 , with PDZ domain unoccupied , ( “closed conformation” ) , and in complex with GluR2 C - terminus ( “open conformation” ) . The “open” conformation allows efficient binding of non - PDZ interactions . © 2008 Nature Publishing Group s u p p l e m e n ta ry i n f o r m at i o n   www . nature . com / naturecellbiology Figure S7 Immunoblots from key experiments shown in full .
