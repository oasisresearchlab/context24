Abstract : Creativity is a crucial factor in finding novel and useful visualization and interaction techniques , but its emergence is contingent on the right conditions . The focus of visualization research has traditionally been on techniques , and to a lesser degree on the process of creating them with domain experts and end users . This paper focuses on the collaborative design of visualizations for information seeking and knowledge management . The difficult , yet common challenge in any visualization project is to find meaningful visual representations and useful interaction techniques to carry out complex analysis tasks . The unique difficulty for preparing co - design activities for visualization lies in the gap between the abstract nature of data and the concrete form of visual representations . To bridge this gap , our co - design framework for visualization places particular emphasis on actors , activities , and artifacts as categories that expand the focus of visualization design beyond the traditional triad of users , tasks , and data . Drawing from general co - design principles , the framework is developed and validated during the course of two case studies in the context of information management systems and library collection databases . Based on observed patterns during the case studies , practical tactics provide advice on carrying out co - design in information visualization . Keywords : Co - design , Information Visualization , Methodology , Knowledge Management , Information seeking , Human - Computer Interaction 1 Introduction Moving beyond the confines of their own discipline , information visualization ( infovis ) researchers and designers are exploring the potential of visualization in various new contexts . Numerous visualization projects have already been pursued in collaboration with other fields , such as the digital humanities ( e . g . , Hinrichs et al . , 2016 ; Jänicke et al . , 2015 ; Koch et al . , 2014 ) . These projects demonstrate the value that visualization can bring to data - intensive work in a widening range of domain - specific contexts . The benefits of such collaborations go both ways . Consider the surge of visualization in journalism , which on one hand has sparked entirely new forms of news reporting and telling stories . On the other hand , the use of visualization in journalism is also tightly linked with technical ( e . g . , Bostock et al . , 2011 ) and conceptual innovations ( Boy et al . , 2015 ; Brehmer et al . , 2014 ; Hullman et al . , 2013 ; Segel & Heer , 2010 ) that were fostered by cross - disciplinary collaborations . As visualizations are being designed in various academic and applied areas , infovis research benefits not only from the demonstrated evidence of its utility , but also from the diverse experiences in the encounters with ‘other domains’ . For this research , we collaborated with information professionals to incorporate their unique experiences that are related to information seeking and knowledge management , activities that have not been in the focus of infovis research so far . Considering this rise of interdisciplinary visualization there is a growing interest in joint research and design projects , in which visualization opportunities are linked up with particular problems in an application area . Reflection on this type of visualization work has already led to multiple process models ( e . g . , Munzner , 2009 ; Sedlmair et al . , * Corresponding author : Marian Dörk , Fachhochschule Potsdam , Potsdam , Germany , E - mail : marian . doerk @ fh - potsdam . de Boris Müller , Jan - Erik Stange , Johannes Herseni , Katja Dittrich , Fachhochschule Potsdam , Potsdam , Germany 218 Marian Dörk et al . 2012 ; McKenna et al . , 2014 ; Meyer et al . , 2015 ) . However , there is relatively little reflection on the specifics of cross - disciplinary collaborations that involve domain experts into the process of visualization design . The models that have been introduced so far position design firmly in the hands of the experts . The input of the collaborators is mostly sought at the beginning , when the design goals are formulated , and towards the end during validation of the resulting visualizations . The core of any visualization design is still the dominion of visualization researchers and designers . Yet , the visualization community has a keen interest in its various users and stakeholders . There has been promising research on tools and systems aimed at novices to conceive and create their own visualizations ( e . g . , Viégas et al . , 2007 ; Viégas et al . , 2009 ) . In addition , studying how people with no visualization experience use ‘non - technological’ means to construct visualizations can provide valuable insights for the design of authoring tools ( Huron et al . , 2014 ) . In the development of visual information systems there is little experience with involving the prospective users into the very generation of visualization idioms . This is where our work sets in . Drawing from our own and others’ experiences with co - design ( Sanders , 2008 ) , we seek to devise a design methodology that deeply involves stakeholders with varying backgrounds into the design process . In this paper , we develop and evaluate an approach to visualization design that emphasizes – the continuous involvement of actors with domain expertise , – the deliberate design of communicative - generative activities , and – the importance of evocative artifacts as translational aids . To explore these aspirations , we report on two case studies in the context of information systems : knowledge management and digital libraries . Incorporating the experience and expertise from knowledge management and information seeking expands the empirical foundation for co - designing visualization and for validating the proposed approach . More generally , the insights from these two studies also form the basis for practical tactics to guide co - design in library and information science . 2 Background In the following , we introduce the concept of co - design , discuss its specific manifestations in computing , especially interaction design , and reflect on design - related research in infovis . 2 . 1 Co - Design The term co - design goes back to the marketing notion of co - creation , which describes a shift in the value generation traditionally carried out by manufacturers of products to their respective consumers ( Prahalad & Ramaswamy , 2004 ) . Critical building blocks for this shift to happen are the possibility for users to engage in a dialogue and the availability of relevant information . This change in marketing coincides with an extensive trend across the economies towards services ( Vargo & Lusch , 2004 ) . The ‘service - dominant logic’ frames any kind of value exchange as a relational exercise , which primarily transfers skills and knowledge , while goods or services are merely viewed as carriers . The relationship between providers and customers is established and maintained through encounters and joint activities ( ibid ) . We seek to explore the interactions among various stakeholders during visualization design and their potential for the co - creation of visualization concepts and artifacts . In the context of design , the ideas of co - creation have taken the shape of what is known as co - design , with strong linkages to the Scandinavian tradition of participatory design ( Muller & Kuhn , 1993 ) . Co - design is a well - documented process during which designers , developers , researchers , domain experts , and other stakeholders collaborate to carry out design work . It is based on participatory principles and aims at the cooperative solution of a design problem ( Sanders & Stappers , 2008 ) . Especially , the joint making of artifacts using probes , tools , and prototypes has been identified to be crucial for the different phases of the design process ( Sanders & Stappers , 2014 ) . On the one hand , artifacts serve as objects that mediate sociality ( Knorr Cetina , 1997 ) and , on the other hand , they can act as evocative examples that spur creativity throughout the design process ( Herring et al . , 2009 ) . It is especially the social and creative aspect that Co - Designing Visualizations for Information Seeking and Knowledge Management 219 is essential in co - design . The principles of co - design have gathered interest in a broad range of domains , from human - computer interaction ( Muller & Druin , 2002 ) and assistive technologies ( De Couvreur et al . , 2013 ) to service design ( Steen et al . , 2011 ; Pirinen , 2016 ) and urban planning ( Al - Kodmany , 1999 ) . A common principle across these disciplines , in which co - design has been taken up , is the deliberate identification and inclusion of relevant actors into joint design processes . Involving users in the design of information systems has already been discussed as user participation ( e . g . , Hartwick & Barki , 1994 ; Bødker , 1996 ) . As a basis for mutual learning and collective problem - solving , the notion of ‘informed participation’ describes the conditions supporting participants to “construct new knowledge collaboratively” and providing the “resources that enable users to generate new ideas” ( Fischer & Ostwald , 2002 ) . Akin to the way designers and developers bring in their prior experiences from related projects , the stakeholders bring in their own domain knowledge . The focus of design then lies not on the resulting system , but the structure of the encounters such as situations and environments that empower all participants to express themselves and jointly create solutions ( Fischer , 2003 ) . This approach has some resemblance to agile software development , in which users become critical experts that are often integrated into the team ( Cockburn & Highsmith , 2001 ) . When people are involved in the design of artifacts that they would be using , the ownership typically increases ( van Rijn & Stappers , 2008 ) , and designers and developers achieve a deep understanding of the relationship a stakeholder has with the design problem . However , even though co - design techniques are well - established in a number of technical , creative , and academic disciplines ( e . g . , Rijn & Stappers , 2008 ; Sanders & Stappers , 2008 ; Visser et al . , 2005 ) , there has not been any research explicitly studying co - design principles in the domain of infovis . 2 . 2 Design and InfoVis We are witnessing a growing interest in the process of collaborating with domain experts to jointly come up with visualization techniques and evaluate their capacity to support analysis . This approach to infovis research can be understood as a design - based approach . The notion of design orientation ( Fallman , 2003 ) offers a pragmatic approach to research , during which generative activities such as sketching , collaging , and prototyping form a dialogue between different stakeholders allowing for the collaborative production and exchange of knowledge . We are building on designerly ways of knowing ( Cross , 2001 ) in that we hope to generate knowledge about the artificial world of infovis and how to create , change , and maintain it collaboratively with stakeholders . There is a thickening line of infovis research that considers the research and design process itself . For example , the nested model provides helpful advice where to position a research project by guarding against threats to validity at different levels ( Munzner , 2009 ) . The design study methodology comprises three main phases of applied visualization research with practical suggestions and pitfalls ( Sedlmair et al . , 2012 ) . Expanding on these efforts , the design activity framework places particular emphasis on the non - linearity of research activities carried out in visualization design studies ( McKenna et al . , 2014 ) . In these models , the research activity is carried out by visualization experts and the primary object of study and scrutiny is the resulting visualization system . We are interested in building on these approaches by examining the role of artifacts , not as ends of a design process , but as means for a mutual exchange of knowledge and the collaborative creativity in infovis design . Visualization research has already started to explore the relationship between creativity and infovis . For example , domain - specific visualizations may not only trigger insights , but also stimulate creativity during brainstorming ( Dove et al . , 2013 ) . Creativity techniques have also been successfully introduced into user - centered visualization design ( Goodwin et al . , 2013 ) . While the former study did not aim to create visualization techniques , but rather new ideas for products and services , the involvement of domain experts in the latter study was limited to early input on requirements and late feedback on prototypes . However , the recent rise of interdisciplinary visualization research at the intersections with the sciences and humanities shows how close collaborations can produce new kinds of knowledge . Reflections on a collaboration between visualization researchers and literary scholars have led to a recognition of the social and organizational factors going into the design of visualizations ( McCurdy et al . , 2016 ) . This thinking resonates with our own experiences with collaborative visualization design , during which reciprocal shaping and guided emergence of ideas can take place . We are curious to examine how domain experts can be more closely integrated into the core design phase when visualization concepts are being generated , discussed , and iterated . 220 Marian Dörk et al . 2 . 3 Towards Co - Design in InfoVis Creating useful visualizations for particular domains can be a challenge due to the various kinds of knowledge , vocabularies , requirements , and expectations involved . Traditionally , infovis design has been largely data - driven , i . e . , the starting point and focus for a given visualization project was the data set at hand . Visualization developers would look for data patterns and generate visual encodings to represent the properties that are pertinent for a given application area . Based on the type of data set , its structure , dimensionality , and size , specific visualization techniques would then be considered to be more adequate than others . Only at the very end of a project , prospective users would be involved to validate the resulting visualization . Quite often this approach has led to visualization techniques that may have been technologically advanced and appropriate for a well - defined data type , but often enough they were not well adjusted to the real - world context , where a multitude of data sets of varying quality and completeness are the norm . With an increasing recognition of the need for user - centered design , this approach has been largely overturned and reversed . The people meant to be using the visualization after it has been implemented are increasingly consulted at the very beginning of a visualization project , to better understand the needs and requirements they have before the design process unfolds . An important outcome of such user - centered visualization research has been the characterization of the tasks in various fields of practice , which has led to a considerable number of task typologies each aiming to systematize a wide variety of data - analytical practices at difference levels of abstraction ( e . g . , Brehmer & Munzner , 2013 ; Lam et al . , 2018 ; Schulz et al . , 2013 ) including task characterizations for specific data types ( Kerracher et al . , 2015 ; Pretorius et al . , 2014 ) . While the understanding of what a task is can vary considerably ( Rind et al . , 2014 ) , this research is important groundwork for the design of user - centered visualizations . However , the focus on arriving at clearly delineated and domain - agnostic tasks tends to construct a clarity that arguably is not reflected in the messy and multiplexed data practices in specific work settings . 3 Bridging Gaps We aim to develop an approach to visualization design that does not rely on general data models or task abstractions , but on the specific practices and preferences of the people using the respective information systems . This approach builds on previous experiences of co - design , which have already yielded solutions that are more sensitive to the context , for and in which they are being created and used ( e . g . , Sanders & Stappers , 2008 ) . However , despite being well established in a number of fields , so far co - design has not seen much adoption in visualization . Reasons for this may be the abstract nature of many data sets and the complexity of analysis practices , which can make it challenging to pursue hands - on design activities with novices , or , more generally , the fact that visualization practice spans multiple disciplines itself , in addition to the specific disciplinary context of the target domain . We contend that the main challenge for co - designing visualizations is that the collaborative creation of meaningful and useful visualizations for specific application areas implies three knowledge gaps and mismatches : 1 . Visualization designers inherently have a limited understanding of the domain - specific practices that are to be supported or transformed . 2 . Typically , the future users of a new visualization are experts in their domain , but have limited knowledge about the spectrum of infovis techniques that are feasible and the types of analysis tasks that a visualization may enable . 3 . There is often an expectation gap between the visualization to be created on one side , and the available data and necessary tasks to be carried out on the other side . While stakeholders would wish to see a certain dimension across an information space , the underlying dataset may not include sufficient detail . Our aim is to find ways to bridge these gaps in dialogic and generative encounters during which we collaboratively pursue pragmatic solutions . To achieve this , the participation of domain experts and prospective users in the design process should continue throughout the entire process : from formulating joint design goals and sketching initial ideas to discussing paper prototypes and evaluating the first software implementation . We aim to devise an approach to visualization design that leads to a structured and open process , which is meant to enable a continuous , creative exchange between domain experts , visualization designers , current or prospective users , and other stakeholders . Co - Designing Visualizations for Information Seeking and Knowledge Management 221 To structure and plan the co - design process as a productive and on - going dialogue , we propose to expand the scope of visualization design by considering more broadly the diverse set of stakeholders as actors , the entire design process as a connected series of activities , of which each involves the joint creation and critique of artifacts ( see Figure 1 ) . The overarching research question is whether this constellation proves to be a viable framework to guide the co - design of visualizations in support of knowledge management and information seeking . In addition , with actors , activities , and artifacts as key components of the co - design framework , several practical questions arise : 1 . To which degree can roles of the different actors be shifted to encourage mutual knowledge exchange and idea generation ? 2 . What is the purpose of artifacts in facilitating collaborative design of visualizations and discussions of the outcomes ? 3 . How can a series of joint activities be planned and structured to enable fruitful and effective co - design that addresses design goals and research questions ? In the following , we outline how a deliberate consideration of actors , artifacts , and activities can provide a scaffolding for finding answers to these questions in the context of specific design studies . 3 . 1 Actors Actors refer to all the people involved in the course of a design study . The notion of ‘users’ in infovis tends to frame the people for whom visualizations are being designed as passive subjects of visualization research that one draws from as a resource to gain user requirements and to evaluate visualization prototypes . We argue that we need to shift this role entirely , and devise ways to support collaborators to become co - creators of the tools that they will use . Following from this , we view current and prospective users of visualizations as subjects in the philosophical sense , as thinking , feeling , and acting beings . It is the ambition of co - design to involve them as full collaborators throughout the process . This does not mean that they become visualization experts , but that the design process needs to be conceived in such a way that collaborators can meaningfully contribute to it . The actors of each design study fall into two core groups : – The infovis team consists of researchers , developers , and designers with backgrounds in computer science , interface design , psychology , and related fields . Throughout a design study , people in the infovis team act as facilitators and participants in the design study . Artifacts Actors Activities engage in articulate generate invite involve connect Figure 1 : The co - design framework for information visualization suggests a joint consideration of actors , activities , and artifacts in an integrated design process . 222 Marian Dörk et al . – The domain group are collaborators in the design study , with less experience in infovis , but with everyday experience and professional expertise in the target domain . While the infovis team is most often part of a research group or a design studio , the stakeholders in the domain group can have diverse affiliations and backgrounds . In both groups there may be different roles and responsibilities with regard to the design study , which need to be considered when planning co - design activities . For example , in the domain group there would be one person who can be considered the project owner , with a vested interest in making the collaboration with the infovis team succeed . They are the primary contact , and they are often the person one can consult to understand the social roles of the other participants . Additional roles in the domain group can be maintainers of the technology in use ( e . g . , a library database ) , and the current or prospective users ( e . g . , library patrons ) . The composition of the groups can change over the course of the design study and in the different activities to be carried out . 3 . 2 Artifacts Artifacts are an essential component in co - design . For the purpose of this research , we understand artifacts as any digital or physical object deliberately created during the co - design process . They create a visual and conceptual reference system for each design iteration . If the design problem has a direct relationship with a physical space or object , the co - design process can make use of these physical properties . Quite different from this is the preparation of artifacts for co - design in infovis . The particular challenge here is the contrast of abstract data as raw , yet elusive material and the necessity to transform it into a physical object that is graspable by stakeholders and easy to experiment with in co - design workshops , so stakeholders are put in a position to build and visualize their ideas with these artifacts . The creation of these tangible artifacts is a design task in itself . Data excerpts need to be selected and translated into visual or physical entities that are meaningful and understandable by the stakeholder . In a co - design process , all artifacts are designed objects , in a sense that they have a unique purpose in the creative process and convey a specific meaning . However , it is important to distinguish the different roles of the artifacts as they can easily be misinterpreted : – Evocation : Artifacts initiate the design process and trigger imaginations . – Articulation : Artifacts help participants to express a concept in a workshop . – Prototype : Artifacts serve as a semi - functional interpretation of a concept . An artifact as an evocation has a symbolic role in the co - design process . These can be extremely vague artifacts like mood boards that attempt to communicate a certain emotion . Evocations can also be much more concrete , for example , excerpts of databases that provide an impression of the data . As such , the role of the artifacts is to bring abstract data into the world and make it tangible and malleable . While this seems to be straightforward , the selection and presentation of the data excerpt is in itself a design task . The excerpts need to be open for creative interpretation , they must be expressive and understandable to be immediately used by the workshop participants . An artifact as an articulation is the result of the synthesis and transformation of evocations performed by the workshop participants . The articulations enable the participants to express concepts and ideas in the form of concrete objects . As it is difficult to verbalize graphical ideas for visualizations , it is crucial to present the participants with visual and physical material that enables them to make statements appropriate for the communication of their ideas . The evocations are an important prerequisite for the generation of articulations , which are statements that represent a certain idea , connection , or concept . Articulations need to be translated and interpreted by the infovis team and turned into prototypes . This is a highly integrative approach as results from the workshops can be contradictory . Furthermore , the articulations are expressions of ideas . They usually do not form a coherent solution to a specific problem . The design of the prototype is a synthesis of various , sometimes conflicting ideas . The results of this phase rely more on the professional design process performed by the infovis team . They are not finalized systems but rather more coherent and more integrated iterations . As prototypes already simulate a finalized system , they can be subject to rigorous testing and feedback . Co - Designing Visualizations for Information Seeking and Knowledge Management 223 3 . 3 Activities As illustrated in Figure 2 , a co - design process consists of multiple activities , each of which have distinct aims involving specific sets of actors and artifacts . Central to our approach are open and creative workshops during which members of the infovis team and the domain group work closely together to generate ideas and discuss concepts . In these workshops , participants use various materials to produce and exchange individual articulations from the evocative artifacts provided . In the area of infovis this co - design process can be characterized by three idiosyncrasies : 1 . The process is focused on negotiating the relationship between data , stakeholders , and their needs . Designers become mediators between these actors and artifacts . This mediation takes place during activities , which the artifacts are specifically designed for . 2 . During the workshops the complexities of the data and the particular needs of the actors are bridged . A challenge in the design of these workshops is a reasonable balance between addressing the specifics of stakeholders and leaving room for surprise in the design process . 3 . User needs , data sets , and tasks are not static entities , but are continuously constructed and performed ( Drucker , 2013 ) . The activities are deliberately structured to help the participants utilize artifacts to openly negotiate the various roles and states of these entities . We propose a design process that consists of formalized activities as well as open - ended ones . The formalized activities are based on existing methods of user experience design ( ISO 9241 - 210 : 2019 ) . Contextual inquiries or shadowing techniques can be used to understand the basic scope of the use cases . Software prototyping and expert evaluations generate qualitative insights on the success of specific design decisions . Our approach to the open - ended , more creative activities is more unique and a contribution to the ongoing debate on design methodologies . We treat the setup of each workshop as a design problem , for which the following sets of questions can guide the planning : – Where are we at in the design process ? What do we want to achieve now ? – Who is taking part in the activity ? What kind of experiences are particularly relevant ? – How can we turn data into tangible artifacts ? How can we translate user needs and tasks into stories and activities ? What are adequate materials , instruments , and props for this ? – How can the participants be empowered to develop ideas and make decisions ? Fundamental to this approach are the concepts of empowerment , ownership , and capacity building . If an actor understands both the limitations and the possibilities of the data set , and has an idea about the mechanisms of visual Figure 2 : The co - design process comprises a series of connected activities , of which each are defined by the participating actors and artifacts . 224 Marian Dörk et al . representation and interaction , they are better able to define and design visualizations that meet their needs and reflect the scope of the data set . While each activity is defined by the selection of actors and artifacts , the concatenation of activities forms the overall design process . Results and insights generated in one activity inform the subsequent ones . In the following two sections , we report from two co - design studies , involving comprehensive databases , a diverse set of stakeholders each with particular perspectives and expectations . It is important to note that we , as researchers , assume the hybrid role of actors and observers . Akin to the notion of action design research ( McCurdy et al . , 2016 ) , we are not merely passive bystanders but are embedded and involved in the activities constituting the research and design process . We made observations during workshops and reflections on all other activities , we analyzed the visual artifacts , such as collages , sketches , and paper prototypes , and collected feedback during the activities and in personal communications . While the two case studies are similar in scope and domain , they differ in that the first case study targets a more specialized user group , while the co - design carried out in the second case study aimed at a broader target audience . Both case studies followed a similar order of activities , the selection of artifacts and involvement of actors differed considerably . 4 Case Study 1 : Knowledge Management The first case study was a research cooperation with a governmental department over the course of nine months . The department that relies on a knowledge management system , which is based on a proprietary database and user interfaces , and has become an essential tool for running the department and is increasingly used for strategic planning . However , like most proprietary systems , it lacks an adequate interface that allows the users to easily visualize and interact with the data . So , there was a significant need and opportunity to combine a user - centered design approach with the development of meaningful data visualizations . Our aim was to create visualization interfaces that not only represent the data but that are also integrated into the analysis practices at the department . See Table 1 for an overview of the main elements of the co - design process carried out in this case study . Table 1 : The selection of actors , activities , and artifacts of the first case study . Actors Activities Artifacts Infovis team – Principal investigator – Interaction designers – Software developer Domain group – Managers – Data experts – Clerks and interns External collaborators – Expert interviews – Contextual inquiries – Workshops – Design sprints : Sketching , Wireframing , Screen design , Feedback sessions – Software prototyping – Mood boards – Infovis cheat sheet – Paper templates – Data excerpts : tables & factsheets – Sketched user interface elements – Paper prototypes – Screen designs – Interactive prototypes From the beginning , the actors in the project were clearly defined : The infovis team consisted of a principal investigator , two interaction designers , and a software and visualization developer . Additional support was provided by external collaborators — especially for the evaluation of the project . The domain group were representatives from the governmental department . The members of the group came from various levels of the department and included managers , domain experts but also clerks and interns . Hence , we had access to a wide range of collaborators who had a very diverse working relationship with the knowledge management system . The project plan followed a user - centered design process ( ISO 9241 - 210 : 2019 ) and had several project stages . We conducted interviews and contextual inquiries , workshops , design sprints , prototyping , and evaluations . Our collaborators established contact with a total of 14 representative users , who were visited at their workplace at the Co - Designing Visualizations for Information Seeking and Knowledge Management 225 governmental department over a period of three weeks and interviewed by members of the infovis team about their professional role , kind of data - related activities , and observed during typical activities with the systems . The findings collected in the interviews were recorded in keywords and evaluated with the help of affinity diagramming . A total of five topic areas crystallized as clusters : purpose , subjective situation , interface / UX , data / representation , and feature requests . Within these subject areas , various requirements could be defined that served as guidelines for the subsequent design process . For the purpose of this paper , we now focus on three specific situations where our framework for co - design made a particular difference and where we were able to usefully structure the relationship between actors , activities , and artifacts . There was a high degree of continuity between all activities ; insights and results of the first stages directly influenced the design and implementation of the later ones ( see Figure 3 ) . Figure 3 : The material used in early workshops was used by the participants to formulate scenarios and devise use cases for visualization . During additional workshops , sketches of refined visualization ideas were shared with the collaborators to discuss the overall directions of the joint project . Communication with the domain experts during successive design iterations was facilitated by the continuity of ideas being refined via wireframes and the final screen design . Core functionalities of the interface concepts were implemented in modular prototypes . 4 . 1 Kickoff Workshop The initial workshop was the first formalized meeting between the infovis team and the domain group . At this stage , both groups did not have a great understanding of each other . The infovis team had very little knowledge of the technology and the tasks , roles , and responsibilities within the domain group . On the other hand , the domain group knew very little about the design space , in general , and especially very little about infovis . The aim of the kickoff workshop was to establish a common ground and to develop a greater understanding of the respective other group . For this , the selection of the appropriate artifacts and activities was crucial . 226 Marian Dörk et al . The infovis team prepared a number of artifacts that created a foundation for the activities during the workshop . These evocations included general mood boards and reference projects , but also more specific items . Three were especially relevant for the implementation of the workshop . – A “cheat sheet” for infovis contained an overview of the Gestalt laws and of visual variables ( Bertin , 1983 ) with the aim to establish very basic knowledge of the infovis principles and support capacity building in the domain group . – Paper templates contained simple graphic structures . The main visual element is a panel for sketching that is accompanied by a brief questionnaire regarding the sketch . As the knowledge management system contains geographical data , some templates also contained maps . – Carefully designed data excerpts were provided as printed tables and factsheets to the members of the domain group . They would recognize the content that was extracted from the knowledge management system and that they could easily understand and visually interpret . These artifacts were then utilized in three activities aimed to transform the evocations into articulations . The workshop participants were asked to utilize the artifacts to make their domain knowledge visible and to create expressions of their own ideas . Participants had also access to conventional workshop material such as pens , color pencils , stickers , and sticky notes and were encouraged to freely use all the material . Warm - up : First we wanted to establish a certain level of understanding of infovis techniques . For this , we split the workshop participants into three different groups with an equal representation of members from the domain and infovis groups . We then asked the participants to visually compare two aspects of the data excerpt . For this , they could use the infovis cheat sheet . The aim of this activity was more focused on competence building than on the expression of ideas , but as we used real data , some workshop participants already came up with ideas that were used in the next activities . Show and find out : The second and third activity during the workshop were very similar , they only differed in the assignment . The first assignment was to come up with a visualization that makes a certain aspect of the data easy to understand ( “I want to show…” ) . The second assignment was already addressing aspects of the user interface : the participants were asked how a visualization could look like that answered a specific question ( “I want to find out…” ) . The workshops resulted in a number of artifacts that provided the infovis team with insights into the questions , tasks , and workflows of the domain group . The evocative artifacts enabled the domain group to articulate a number of concepts and ideas that would accompany the entire team throughout the project . Some of these articulations became points of reference for the design and prototyping stage and were often referred to during discussions . So even these very early articulations became very valuable for the development of the entire project . 4 . 2 Interface Sketches Another crucial co - design situation was the paper prototyping stage . Here we were highly interested in gaining insights into the relationship of visualizations and user interface elements . We wanted to find out , which interface controls the users prefer and if new ways of working with the data could be envisioned . As evocative artifacts , the infovis team prepared roughly sketched user interface elements , such as search boxes , buttons , and sliders , but also more complex elements like maps , curated lists of metadata , or infovis design patterns . It was important that the visual appearance of the elements was “sketchy” to remind the participants that they are not dealing with finished design elements . The procedure of the workshop was similar to the kickoff workshop . The participants were encouraged to transform the relatively vague artifacts into more concrete articulations that would express a certain approach to the design of a user interface . An interesting aspect of this situation was that the results were much more elaborate and could sometimes already be taken as a prototype . The acceptance of these paper prototypes within the domain group was very high and provided the infovis team with a large number of specific insights and ideas for the next project stage . Co - Designing Visualizations for Information Seeking and Knowledge Management 227 4 . 3 Software Prototyping As a result of the paper - prototyping workshop , we were able to identify the core functionality and visual components of the new interface . However , the main challenge of this stage was to integrate the different and , in part , contradicting ideas that were developed in earlier stages . For example , requests for high levels of flexibility and customizability stood in a certain conflict with the notion of intuitive ease of use . In order to create a coherent visual and interactive system , we had to make compromises and negotiate between different approaches . At this stage , the high level of involvement of the domain group proved to be extremely valuable . As the different members of the domain group were aware of the existing concepts and ideas and as these ideas also existed as articulations , it was possible to make consensual decisions for the final prototype . Technically , the system was divided into small functional units for rapid prototyping . This allowed for rapid development of a system with highly modular visualization components that were customizable by the users and that could continuously be tested and evaluated by the domain group . 4 . 4 Outcomes At the end of the project , we conducted a qualitative evaluation with members of the domain group . We were interested in two main questions : 1 ) are the users satisfied with the final product , and 2 ) are the users satisfied with the overall design process ? While the answers to the first question provided a number of important insights for the further development of the software interface and the visualization elements ( e . g . , the importance of clear and concise explanations ) , the answers to the second question are more relevant in the context of this paper . We received very positive feedback for the process . A number of participants stated that they had acquired new competencies in the area of process management and infovis . Furthermore , almost all participants stated that they felt very involved in the process and were able to express their own ideas . One person called the process innovative and stated that it was actually fun . These results from the first case study were encouraging and demonstrate the positive impact of co - design . The high degree of involvement of the different actors , the careful planning of activities , and the production of different artifacts resulted not only in the successful re - conceptualization of a knowledge management system , but also in the empowerment of the domain experts . 5 Case Study 2 : Information Seeking The goal of the second case study , which also lasted nine months , was to develop integrated infovis techniques for the exploration of a large and multifaceted digital library and to integrate these visualizations into a search interface . The project was a collaboration with a national library . In addition to collecting various types of media , such as books , magazines , catalogs , records , and sheet music , the library also maintains an authority file containing information on persons , organizations , and subject headings . The combination of the library catalog , the authority file , and a wide group of potential users provided a fitting context for applied visualization research . See Table 2 for an overview of the main elements comprising the co - design process during the second case study . Akin to the first case study , the actors in the project were clearly defined . The infovis team consisted of a principal investigator , an interaction designer , and a software developer . Additional support was provided by external collaborators during the research and preparation phase , the implementation of the prototype , and the evaluation of the project . The domain group was also a diverse team that included managers , domain experts in library science , and library database users . Throughout the activities the number of participants of the domain group varied , but at all times at least one manager , expert , and user were involved . 228 Marian Dörk et al .

Co - Designing Visualizations for Information Seeking and Knowledge Management 229 5 . 1 Expert Interviews and Contextual Inquiries First , we needed to grasp the extent of the library collection as well as the expectations , needs , and problems of the stakeholders involved in the project . Since we did not have programmable access to the database at this point , we used the library website and existing OPAC ( Online Public Access Catalog ) interface to gather preliminary insights into the collection , its current representation , and the apparent architecture of the underlying database . We used these insights to prepare the subsequent steps : expert interviews and contextual inquiries . Expert interviews with members of the domain group provided important background information on the structure , scale , and long - term evolution of the collection and database , as well as the relevant work practices such as documentation , indexing , and the usage of the OPAC system . The interviews were carried out as semi - structured interviews with a set of questions on each of these aspects . During contextual inquiries in the reading room of the library , we observed participants using the OPAC interface for various information tasks and learned about the strategies they employed and problems they encountered . After receiving consent from the participants , the observations took place one by one in the reading room of the library , while each session took about 30 minutes . Participants were asked to continue their research with the library system . The key insight we gathered during this stage of the project was that the domain experts considered the collection to be particularly extensive and diverse . However , they were aware that the OPAC interface does not expose these characteristics and does not offer any tools for exploring the collection . The observations we made during the contextual inquiries with library patrons recruited in the local reading room confirmed this . We learned that people predominantly use search boxes and that they search the collection iteratively . Based on the expert interviews and contextual inquiries we developed a set of scenarios , which described a fictitious user and a task they would solve or a question they would answer using the library’s digital collection . The scenarios served two purposes during the remainder of the project : First , we used them to evaluate our concepts and to test whether our design proposals could be used to solve the tasks described in them . Second , they served as a framework for a series of co - design workshops with diverse actors . 5 . 2 Collaging Workshops The participants of the workshops included a range of experts and non - experts from the domain group . The participants were then divided into groups of three or four and given a scenario sheet to create a paper prototype . In addition , we provided each group with evocative artifacts such as printed book covers , metadata displays , screenshots of the current OPAC interface , photos of persons , and maps . Every group was joined by a member of the infovis team , who would moderate the discussion , keep the group focused , and offer advice regarding exploratory search and infovis . Based on the scenarios , the first aim of this workshop was to translate the artifacts into articulations in the form of collages ( see Figure 4 , left ) . Afterwards , the results were interpreted by the other groups before being explained by the group that created it . This approach resulted in lively and controversial discussions between participants and helped us to further improve our understanding of stakeholder needs and preferences . Based on the collages and discussion notes , we developed a set of design goals in close collaboration with members of the domain group . These goals would support us during the subsequent design stages . Most importantly , one insight was that the visual interface should permit both open exploration and directed search . The interface should be based primarily on interactive visualizations of the main facets , but still offer text - based search . The visualizations should function as both a tool for further exploration and for refining search parameters . 5 . 3 Concept and Design In the next step , we conducted a set of team - internal workshops aimed to flesh out ideas derived from the collages , to check whether they would meet the previously defined requirements , and to assess whether they were technically feasible . During these workshops , we strongly relied on paper sketches , with which the workshop participants created 230 Marian Dörk et al . more refined articulations that enabled us to discuss and develop many different visualization types , information architectures , and user flows . We then created wireframes of our proposed interface and presented them to the domain group . Since the feedback from this presentation was positive , we started refining the wireframes and created a visual design language for the overall interface . We also refined the methods of interaction , the links between the facets and the result space , and the information architecture . Next , we presented both the refined concept and the visual design . Feedback from this presentation resulted in further adjustments of the concept and some improvements of the visual design . As a final step , we evaluated the interface using focus group conversations with both experts and non - experts . Since the interactive prototype was not usable yet at this point , we provided participants with paper printouts of each screen . The evaluation revealed some flaws in our concept and some usability issues , which were addressed in a final iteration . 5 . 4 Data Preparation and Software Prototype Working with a snapshot of the library’s database proved to be more difficult than we had expected , which required considerable back - and - forth communication between the infovis team and the domain group . This process was further complicated by the varying quality of the meta data and by the sheer size of the database export . For the prototype it was crucial to find design strategies to display the large amount of data in the front end without overwhelming the user . It was therefore critical for the developer and designer to work closely together during the last stages of the design process to ensure technical feasibility . Sketches of both the database schema and the visualization concepts supported cross - disciplinary collaboration within the infovis team . The software prototype was finished and published as a web - based search interface1 that was announced by the library via their social media channels and website . 5 . 5 Outcomes Towards the end of this case study , we carried out a summative evaluation in the form of two focus groups and one expert interview and walkthrough . The main points were recorded as notes and subsequently analyzed using affinity diagramming . In addition , we regularly noted our own observations during activities throughout the project . The visualization interface was characterized by the participants of the focus groups as well as by the expert as an appropriate tool for explorative research in the library catalog . It was found particularly helpful when users want to work on new topics or find answer to general questions . The visualization along the three facets people , topics and time was described as relevant and understandable , but the interaction could still be improved in detail . Adapting the layout of the application could also improve interaction by placing more emphasis on the result set and thus linking it more clearly with the facets . At the same time , the interface expert warned against overloading the interface with features sacrificing its simplicity and accessibility . According to the participants in the focus groups and the expert , exciting and surprising findings are mainly the result of serendipitous findings . In retrospect , our collaborative approach has enabled the mutual exchange of ideas and insights at the intersection of infovis research and library management . In the context of visualization research , the project has led to several ideas for integrating search and exploration for an extensive and diverse information space . Using interactive and interlinked visualizations to represent different facets in varying levels of detail is one possible method for improving the access to such collections . The positive response to the interactive prototype from our collaborators as well as external members of the domain group suggests that infovis techniques can be a useful supplement for text - based search . Throughout the co - design process , it was noticeable how the collaborators were able to comprehend the evolution of ideas between different activities . This had the effect of a sense of co - ownership of the interim and final results , in both the infovis team and domain group . 1 The prototype is available here : https : / / dnbvis . fh - potsdam . de Co - Designing Visualizations for Information Seeking and Knowledge Management 231 6 Findings The co - design approach served as a scaffold for involving actors throughout the two case studies , selecting the appropriate artifacts , and devising meaningful and effective activities . In this section , we reflect on some pertinent patterns that we observed during the activities in both case studies . Key observations were noted in an online document and discussed by the infovis team after each activity . Our own observations and the feedback from collaborators and participants have been analyzed and aggregated into three major themes and synthesized as implications for co - design in infovis . 6 . 1 Diverse Backgrounds and Interests The selection of actors in each co - design activity was deliberately carried out to reach a mixed and diverse group of stakeholders . Furthermore , during an activity we paid close attention to the composition of sub - groups to be diverse as well . This had the effect that everyone had the opportunity and , to some degree , the obligation to share and encounter different perspectives on the theme of the project . For example , varying familiarity with a given data set was actually conducive to the overall conversation as it encouraged the verbalization of insights and issues . In addition to differences in expertise , a variety of perspectives also resulted in a range of aspirations to be discussed and negotiated during the course of the co - design activities . We noticed that it was also useful to invite potential stakeholders , i . e . , people who are not part of the infovis team or domain group , but who might be using a visualization in the future or who would in principle have an interest in the data . Having also people with no firm commitment towards the project , but rather a cursory interest in the topic provided an informed outsider perspective . Use knowledge gradients to encourage dialogue . Involving actors with varying backgrounds and interests provides for a situation that encourages exchanges . Ensure a basic level of commitment and interest among participants , otherwise , there may be limited motivation to meaningfully contribute . 6 . 2 Bridging Difference and Building Capacity While there were productive differences in expertise and experience in most activities during the case studies , the aim was to use these differences to encourage dialogue and making . To achieve this , we noticed that in most activities the artifacts played a very important part . On one hand , artifacts such as book covers and bibliographic information sheets acted as translational aids for actors with different disciplinary and professional experiences . Entities that have a distinct nomenclature within and outside a specialized domain such as library science , would become relatively comprehensible . Being able to simply refer and work with printed images and text as samples from a comprehensive information space significantly lowered the threshold for outsiders to work with the data and talk about it . On the other hand , providing printed samples of basic interface elements and visualization techniques built practical capacity among all actors to closely consider the building blocks of complex visualization systems . By creating interface composites using these printed paper templates , workshop participants were able to engage in the speculative making of visualization systems . Here too , it was not necessary to correctly name the different components , but rather to negotiate the kinds of analytic activities they would like to pursue with them . Introduce relevant and evocative artifacts . Across the different roles—evocation , articulation , and prototyping— artifacts play an essential role in bringing people together with different backgrounds and providing support structures to contribute ( Fischer & Ostwald , 2002 ) . Regardless of the specific activity formats —from co - creation workshop to feedback sessions—the choice of artifacts should be carefully aligned with the aims of the project . While the artifacts being used and created do not necessarily need to resemble the interface or visualization they serve as proto - representations of data , as they already shape what kind of ideas can be articulated and exchanged . Because of this , the selection of artifacts becomes an important design decision with implications for the subsequent steps in the process . 232 Marian Dörk et al . 6 . 3 Joint Ownership and Provenance of Ideas The co - design process comprised several connected activities during which various insights and concepts were collectively developed by all actors . It was our explicit goal to encourage everyone to engage in creative expression as well as discussions of the merit of emergent concepts . For all participants to feel comfortable to contribute it was important to work in an atmosphere of trust and openness . While this aspect hardly required particular intervention , in one instance , it meant to proactively moderate a discussion , during which a particularly verbose participant was dominating the conversation . Not all activities require the same degree of involvement from all actors . However , especially when a diversity of perspectives is being sought it has proven to be useful to be prepared for ensuring the contribution from everyone . While a single idea cannot be linked to an individual actor , the results from one activity do inform the next steps . It was noticeable how the actors in the case studies were interested in comprehending the evolution of ideas all the way from initial sketches to functional prototypes . For this process to succeed , it was paramount to carefully and iteratively build on top of these intermediate results and communicate this process during the activities with our collaborators . While all participating actors assume a shared responsibility to exchange and shape ideas , it is in particular the role of the infovis team to record , analyze , and convey the results of activities and therefore moderate expectations of all actors . We noticed how the diligent and detailed communication of interim steps fostered the understanding of the project’s progression and agreement with the design decisions going forward . Cultivate an atmosphere of trust and transparency . In order to make the co - design process satisfying for all involved actors , it is essential to create the necessary conditions , in particular mutual respect and trust . As ideas and concepts are being developed collectively by all actors , it is important to trace the evolution of ideas between activities and instill a sense of co - ownership over the results . 7 Conclusion There are multiple ways to approach information and visualization research involving other stakeholders . So far there has been considerable work on infovis for ( i . e . , visualization as a service ) and infovis by ( i . e . , visualization as a tool ) specific group of users . A recent surge of design studies , however , indicates the importance of infovis with a specific domain group ( i . e . , visualization as collaboration ) . The focus of our work has been on the latter . We wanted to examine how design studies in infovis can be carried out as continuously collaborative endeavors . Based on established co - design principles developed in other design fields , we have proposed a co - design framework , which hinges on three basic components : actors , activities , and artifacts . According to this framework , a co - design process consists of a series of collaborative activities , during which diverse actors use evocative and meaningful artifacts as proto - representations of data to iteratively generate concepts for visual and interactive representations . We have applied , developed , and evaluated this co - design framework in the context of two consecutive case studies . In each case study , an infovis team was collaborating with stakeholders in the creation of novel visualization systems for the analysis and exploration of complex information spaces . As participating observers , we documented our own experiences as well as the responses from our collaborators in order to assess the viability of the framework for conceiving visualizations in close collaboration . Based on both the results as well as the responses from our collaborators , we can conclude that our co - design framework provides an effective approach to creating visualizations in close collaboration with domain experts . The deliberate consideration of actors , artifacts , and activities offered not only a useful way to think about infovis design with domain experts , but also proved an effective approach to plan and carry out a co - design project at the interface between infovis and information science . We have discussed prominent social patterns that occurred during the collaborative design of infovis systems and outlined practical tactics for bridging likely mismatches in expectation and expertise . An important , if not essential , part of any design activity , is to decide on the scope of a project by identifying and articulating the problem . If we are to open up this process , we need to create the conditions for all collaborators to frame a problem according to their own perspective and preferences . By proposing a different nomenclature with this framework , we transformed contextual considerations of information visualization ( users , tasks , and data ) to central Co - Designing Visualizations for Information Seeking and Knowledge Management 233 concerns of the design process : actors , activities , and artifacts . We are intentionally blurring long - held distinctions : by talking about actors we emphasize that both users and experts should have the license to contribute ideas throughout the process . However , shifting roles does not mean dissolving differences . For infovis , co - design rather suggests a shift of responsibility from producing a final technique or system to structuring an entire design and development process . The results of the two case studies confirm the viability of co - design for applied visualization research that promotes the collaborative creation of useful and meaningful information visualizations that are owned and accepted by all stakeholders .
