Study Design : Newham University Hospital based in East London serving a population with the highest death rate secondary to SARS - CoV - 2 in the UK , commenced universal screening of all admissions to the Maternity Unit from 22nd April to 5th May , 2020 . A proforma was created to capture key patient demographics , indication for admission and presence of SARS - CoV - 2 related symptoms at the point of presentation . Results : A total of 180 women with a mean age of 29 . 9 ( SD 7 . 4 ) years , at a median gestation of 39 ( IQR 37 + 1to 40 + 3 ) weeks underwent universal screening with nasopharyngeal PCR swabs during the two - week period of the study . BAME identity or parity was not associated with the likelihood of a positive result . Seven women ( 3 . 9 % , 1 . 6 to 7 . 8 ) were tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 , of whom 6 ( 3 . 3 % , 1 . 2 to 7 . 1 ) were asymptomatic ; 85 . 7 % ( 42 . 1 to 99 . 6 ) of the SARS - CoV - 2 positive women were asymptomatic . The sensitivity of symptom - driven testing was 14 . 3 % ( 0 . 36 to 57 . 87 ) and specificity was 91 . 86 % ( 86 . 72 to 95 . 48 ) with a positive predictive value of 6 . 67 % ( 1 . 08 to 31 . 95 ) and a negative predictive value of 96 . 34 % ( 95 . 10 to 97 . 28 ) . Conclusion The prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 in the maternity population served by Newham University Hospital was 3 . 9 % , four weeks after lockdown . Of the women who were found to be SARS - CoV - 2 positive , a high proportion ( 87 . 9 % ) were asymptomatic . These findings support the need for universal testing to enable targeted isolation and robust infectious control measures to mitigate outbreaks of SARS - CoV - 2 in maternity units . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Key Words : SARS - CoV - 2 ; Universal screening ; Medical disorders in pregnancy Universal Screening for SARS - CoV - 2 in Pregnant Women at Term Admitted to an East London Maternity Unit Introduction SARS - CoV - 2 , a novel strain of coronavirus causing COVID - 19 , has changed the world in an unprecedented manner . First identified in Wuhan City , China towards the end of 2019 , SARS - CoV - 2 was declared a global pandemic by the WHO on 11 th of March 2020 . 1 The rapid global dissemination of SARS - CoV - 2 may indicate that the currently accepted estimate of the basic reproduction number ( Ro ) may well be an underestimate as asymptomatic carriers of the virus , though still contagious elude detection by public health surveillance systems . 2 Complete lockdown commenced on 23 rd March 2020 in the UK . Lockdown though having proven to be effective at keeping Ro consistently below one 3 , cannot be sustained indefinitely without leading to increasing social and economic damage . Relaxation of lockdown measures without either a pharmacological cure or vaccine will inevitably lead to a resurgence of the virus resulting in a further wave of deaths , with the most socially disadvantaged groups suffering the most . Universal screening together with contact tracing , albeit its challenges , has been postulated to enable the resumption of normal life in the UK . 4 As per current public health guidance in the UK , pregnant women are considered a clinically vulnerable group and are advised to continue shielding to minimise the risk of infection . 5 Although shielding may be possible for other high - risk groups , pregnant women are still required to attend hospital appointments in person for regular antenatal care . Pregnant women have not been found to be more likely to contract SARS - CoV - 2 than the general population 6 , however , physiological adaptations in pregnancy that affect the immune system can lead to more severe symptoms . Maternity services have as a result adapted to minimise virus transmission by conducting virtual clinics , screening for symptoms of SARS - CoV - 2 prior to hospital visits , rationalising scans , limiting visitors and implementing universal screening of all admissions . Newham University Hospital based in East London serving a population with the highest death rate secondary to SARS - CoV - 2 in the UK 7 , commenced universal screening of all admissions to the Maternity Unit on 22 nd April J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 2020 . The primary aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 in our obstetric population and determine the presence of asymptomatic disease . A secondary aim was to identify any relationship between patient demographics and SARS - CoV - 2 . Material and methods All patients admitted to the maternity unit at Newham University Hospital from 22 nd April to 5 th May , 2020 were offered the SARS - CoV - 2 nasopharyngeal PCR swab test . The study was registered with the local clinical effectiveness team and underwent review by the COVID - 19 committee . Ethics approval was not required as this was an anonymous service evaluation . A proforma was created to capture key patient demographics , indication for admission and presence of SARS - CoV - 2 related symptoms at the point of presentation . Details of the patients were recorded in a protected database to allow follow up when the results would become available within 24 hours . Those who tested positive were managed based on the severity of the disease and given self - isolation advice if clinically well . Numerical variables were expressed as a mean and standard deviation or median and interquartile range ( IQR ) based on their distribution . Categorical variables were expressed as numbers and percentages . The Medcalc Diagnostic Test Evaluation Calculator was used to calculate sensitivities , specificities , positive predictive values , and negative predictive values for the presence of symptoms at admission as a predictor for a positive SARS - CoV - 2 screening result . Results A total of 180 women with a mean age of 29 . 9 ( SD 7 . 4 ) years , at a median gestation of 39 ( IQR 37 + 1to 40 + 3 ) weeks underwent universal screening with nasopharyngeal PCR swabs during the two - week period of the study . Two women were excluded from the study , as one of them had previously been suspected to be infected and the other declined testing . The completion rate of the proformas was 98 . 33 % with no record about symptoms for 3 patients . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Hundred and twenty - six women ( 70 % ) were from a Black , Asian or Minority Ethnic group ( BAME ) , mainly of South Asian origin ( 46 . 7 % ) , and 71 ( 39 . 7 % ) were nulliparous . BAME identity or parity was not associated with the likelihood of a positive result . The majority of women were admitted for obstetric indications , whereas 16 ( 8 . 9 % ) had SARS - CoV - 2 suspected symptoms , of whom one was tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 . Figure 1 shows the prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 in our cohort stratified by symptom status with 95 % confidence intervals . Seven women ( 3 . 9 % , 1 . 6 to 7 . 8 ) were tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 , of whom 6 ( 3 . 3 % , 1 . 2 to 7 . 1 ) were asymptomatic ; 85 . 7 % ( 42 . 1 to 99 . 6 ) of the SARS - CoV - 2 positive women were asymptomatic . The sensitivity of symptom - driven testing was 14 . 3 % ( 0 . 36 to 57 . 87 ) and specificity was 91 . 86 % ( 86 . 72 to 95 . 48 ) with a positive predictive value of 6 . 67 % ( 1 . 08 to 31 . 95 ) and a negative predictive value of 96 . 34 % ( 95 . 10 to 97 . 28 ) . Discussion Providing care to pregnant women during the SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic represents a clinical challenge as not only are they more susceptible to any infectious outbreak due to altered physiology , but there is also a clear need to safeguard the health of the fetus . The obstetric population unlike other clinically vulnerable groups still need to access healthcare services on a regular basis and will most likely require admission for delivery . Universal screening of all admissions allows the early identification of asymptomatic carriers . It enables the appropriate use of PPE and effective re - organisation of maternity services to facilitate isolation of positive cases . The prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 at Newham University Hospital was 3 . 9 % , four weeks after lockdown . A similar study at a Maternity Unit in New York showed a prevalence of 15 . 4 % , at the beginning of lockdown . 8 Cities that are geographically far apart at different points in their pandemic experience will consequently have different rates of positive cases . Prevalence of a contagious disease is a dynamic figure and therefore , requires ongoing surveillance and cannot be extrapolated from other populations . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Of the women who were found to be SARS - CoV - 2 positive , a high proportion ( 87 . 9 % ) were asymptomatic . This figure was comparable with the proportion of asymptomatic SARS - CoV - 2 positive women among all SARS - CoV - 2 positive patients in the study by Sutton et al , despite the substantially higher prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 positive women in the latter 9 . These findings support the need for universal testing to enable targeted isolation and tracing ; since symptomatic screening would have identified only one out of 7 women tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 in our study . Interestingly , a similar study by Breslin et al , also based in New York showed only one third who tested positive for the virus were asymptomatic at admission . 9 Though there is some variation in the rates of asymptomatic prevalence , the findings suggest that SARS - CoV - 2 is frequently asymptomatic and should be considered in all pregnant women in areas of high disease prevalence . Strengths of our study include the high completion rate of the screening questionnaire reducing risk of reporting bias . Demographics of the population surveyed were similar to the demographic diversity of the local population in Newham . Limitations of this study include the relatively limited sample size to estimate the prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 , however the consistency of asymptomatic women among all SARS - CoV - 2 positive women strengthen the validity of our findings . Our study was conducted in Newham , an area with the highest mortality rate associated with COVID - 19 in the UK , therefore , extrapolating the results to other maternity services within the UK should be done with caution . Additionally , the true prevalence of the virus may be underestimated due to false - negative results . Conclusion Universal testing will enable the identification of asymptomatic patients and facilitate effective tracing and targeted isolation . These strategies will minimise the risk of further peaks in the pandemic and allow for a safer transition out of complete lockdown . Maternity services provide the ideal platform for this strategy of universal testing given the multiple encounters pregnant women have with health care services as part of their routine antenatal care .
