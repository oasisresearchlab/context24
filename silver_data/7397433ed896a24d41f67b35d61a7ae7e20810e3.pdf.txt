Mechanical Ventilation – induced Lung Release of Cytokines A Key for the Future or Pandora’s Box ? IN this issue of A NESTHESIOLOGY , Whitehead et al . 1 bring experimental evidence suggesting that a high tidal vol - ume ventilation can markedly reduce the release of in - ﬂammatory cytokines in response to intratracheal lipo - polysaccharide . They attribute this paradoxical effect to a reduction of the alveolar macrophage population and hypothesize that injurious ventilation may increase sus - ceptibility to infection , a detrimental effect that may participate in ventilator - induced lung injury . Clinicians have long known some of the risks of me - chanical ventilation . The classic and well - known mani - festations of gross barotrauma ( air leaks ) and the adverse hemodynamic effects of high pressure / volume mechan - ical ventilation were described shortly after the general - ization of mechanical ventilators in intensive care units . More recently , severe histologic distension of bronchoal - veolar structures , 2 lung overinﬂation , 3 – 6 large air cysts , and extended bronchiectasis 7 , 8 have been reported in acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) patients me - chanically ventilated with high tidal volumes and pres - sures . One of the most important breakthroughs in the ventilatory management of such patients was the recog - nition of another iatrogenic potential of mechanical ven - tilation , which has been termed ventilator - induced lung injury ( VILI ) . The concept was derived from animal studies that clearly showed that mechanical ventilation with high airway pressure and tidal volume rapidly caused a permeability - type pulmonary edema with dif - fuse alveolar damage and was accompanied by severe lung inﬂammation when protracted . 9 High lung volume rather than pressure was identiﬁed as responsible for these abnormalities , hence the term volutrauma . In the 1970s , the recommendation was to deliver gen - erous tidal volumes in the range of 15 – 20 ml / kg to patients with acute lung injury 10 , 11 to provide adequate carbon dioxide elimination and counterbalance the for - mation of atelectasis with ensuing development of lung regions with low ventilation / perfusion ratios . 12 In the following years , practices progressively moved toward a reduction of tidal volume to values lower than 10 ml / kg , 13 and , interestingly , a decrease in ARDS mortality was simultaneously observed . 14 These progressive changes in ventilation modalities over time were supported by solid pathophysiologic foundations that form the con - cept of VILI . Deﬁnite proof of a causal relation between mortality and ventilatory strategy was given by the re - sults of a multicenter randomized controlled trial that showed better survival in patients ventilated with a 6 - ml / kg rather than a 12 - ml / kg tidal volume . 15 In addition to the permeability alterations and diffuse alveolar damage observed during VILI , the possibility that lung cell overstretching induced a biochemical re - action was soon investigated . Indeed , lung cell stretch elicits many responses , including opening of ion chan - nels , 16 increased lipid trafﬁcking in cell membranes , 17 and CXC chemokine release . 18 The release of many cy - tokines by lungs subjected ex vivo to injurious ventila - tory modalities was also reported . 19 These ﬁndings led to the hypothesis that the multiple organ system dysfunc - tion observed in many patients with ARDS was the result of uncontrolled production of inﬂammatory cytokines by the lungs and their systemic diffusion because of the alveolocapillary barrier alterations produced by injurious ventilation . 20 , 21 Should this hypothesis prove to be true , it would offer both an interesting explanation for the reduced mortality observed with lung - protective ventila - tion strategies during ARDS and an exciting avenue for the search for newer treatments for this deadly disease . Some authors strongly advocated the use of antiinﬂam - matory therapies during mechanical ventilation of pa - tients with ARDS to decrease the risk and severity of associated organ failure . 20 , 22 , 23 Given the high costs of such therapies and their potential for adverse effects , 24 their administration should be based on strong and con - cordant experimental and clinical data . This may not be the case for the time being . Too many inconsistencies and contradictions exist that preclude making a straightforward link between cell responses to stress , VILI , organ failure , and their putative treatments . 25 Detailing these conceptual problems is be - yond the scope of this editorial , but several aspects deserve mentioning . Pulmonary and systemic cytokine release was found highly variable during experimental VILI , even when experiments were performed under the same conditions and by the same team . For example , the concentration of tumor necrosis factor (cid:1) in bronchoal - veolar lavage was found higher than 1 , 000 pg / ml after This Editorial View accompanies the following article : White - head TC , Zhang H , Mullen B , Slutsky AS : Effect of mechanical ventilation on cytokine response to intratracheal lipopolysac - charide .

This is different from the re - sults of a recent experimental study showing that injuri - ous ventilation promotes the release of inﬂammatory cytokines in rats with mesenteric ischemia – reperfusion ( a two - hit lung injury ) . 29 It is also worth noting that the study by Whitehead et al . 1 also conﬁrms the highly variable release of cytokines observed during experi - mental injurious ventilation . They found no increase in the chemokine macrophage inﬂammatory protein 2 ( the rodent equivalent of interleukin 8 ) in the bronchoalveo - lar lavage ﬂuid of preparations ventilated with an injuri - ous modality ( high tidal volume , zero end - expiratory pressure ) as compared with those ventilated with a pro - tective lung strategy ( low tidal volume , positive end - expiratory pressure ) , whereas in a previous article , using the same experimental settings , they reported a marked increase in this mediator . 19 The authors ascribe this discrepancy to minor protocol changes . 1 Similarly , they report that most of cytokine release in their study was due to alveolar macrophages , whereas in an earlier work , they concluded that pulmonary epithelium was a major contributor of cytokine production during injuri - ous ventilation and may play an important role in the pathogenesis of lung injury . 30 These discrepancies are at the heart of the problem of the relation between mechanical ventilation and cyto - kine release and balance toward inﬂammation or antiin - ﬂammation . Whatever their origin , it is quite difﬁcult to draw a comprehensive theory linking mechanical venti - lation and systemic inﬂammation and organ failure and even more difﬁcult to derive any therapeutic conclusion because , depending on the study , one may conclude that injurious ventilation does not affect cytokine bal - ance 26 , 31 or promotes either inﬂammation 19 , 23 or antiin - ﬂammation , as in the study by Whitehead et al . 1 Clinical studies are as puzzling . One concluded that injurious ventilation orientates lung and systemic cytokine balance toward inﬂammation , 32 whereas another showed that this balance was oriented toward antiinﬂammation . 33 , 34 What can clinicians conclude ? Obviously , lung cells are challenged by multiple aggressions in critically ill patients ( infection , hyperoxia , mechanical ventilation ) . There is no doubt that their response to these potentially injurious stimuli involves a cascade of mediators , includ - ing cytokines , whose complexity is fantastic . However , the variability of the biochemical response observed in extraphysiologic experimental conditions ( isolated non - perfused lungs as in the current study 1 ) must be bal - anced against the well - deﬁned and easy - to - evidence mor - phologic alterations observed in ARDS patients ventilated for prolonged periods of time with high pres - sure / volume mechanical ventilation . 2 – 8 In addition , VILI is certainly not solely the result of mechanical injury 9 and may be worsened by hyperoxia , lung infection , and malnutrition . 2 In the past decade , the prognosis of ARDS markedly improved because of a comprehensive physi - ologic approach of the effects of positive - pressure me - chanical ventilation , 35 and it may further improve as a result of the considerable amount of basic research on cytokines and VILI , including that presented in the arti - cle by Whitehead et al . 1 However , we should remain modest before drawing deﬁnitive theoretical and , more importantly , therapeutic conclusions , and avoid playing the sorcerer’s apprentice . Some exciting hypotheses turned out to be catastrophic for the patients . 36 DidierDreyfuss , M . D . , * Jean - JacquesRouby , M . D . , Ph .

For Outpatients , Does Regional Anesthesia Truly Shorten the Hospital Stay , and How Should We Deﬁne Postanesthesia Care Unit Bypass Eligibility ? IN this issue of A NESTHESIOLOGY , Hadzic et al . 1 report on hand surgery outpatients randomly assigned to receive general anesthesia ( GA ) or infraclavicular nerve block . The speciﬁc aim was to compare discharge times ( a 97 - min difference favoring infraclavicular ) ; the second - ary aim was to compare bypass of the postanesthesia care unit ( PACU ; 76 % infraclavicular vs . 24 % GA ) . This study promotes the use of regional anesthesia ( RA ) to shorten the outpatient stay . Based on these ﬁndings , two questions are raised : ( 1 ) What is the recent evidence indicating that RA use will reduce discharge times , and ( 2 ) what criteria should be used to delineate the PACU bypass milestone ? In clinical practice , many orthopedic procedures have been converted from same - day admit to same - day dis - charge . Converting admissions into same - day discharges is one of two important strategies in reducing duration of stay . Duration of stay reduction via same - day discharge has recently been demonstrated by White et al . 2 ; this random - ized trial compared a popliteal block with placebo infusion against the same block with a continuous infusion ; both treatments were combined with GA . All placebo patients ( 10 of 10 ) were admitted for pain control , versus 4 of 10 of treatment group patients ( P (cid:1) 0 . 03 ) . A multidisciplinary approach is necessary to convert same - day admissions into same - day discharges in clinical practice . 3 Duration of stay reductions on the day of surgery are more challenging because stafﬁng patterns and manage - ment styles vary across institutions . However , discharge time values within institutions are useful , especially in stud - ies that involve large data sets of multiple procedures and capture clinical practice patterns . In a prospective case series ( n (cid:1) 479 ) , Pavlin et al . 4 noted a 90 - min reduction of discharge times when peripheral nerve block ( n (cid:1) 72 ) was used versus GA ( n (cid:1) 230 ) . This time savings is consistent with that reported by Hadzic et al . 1 In a follow - up study ( n (cid:1) 175 ) , Pavlin et al . 5 showed that ( 1 ) maximum pain score predicted recovery time , ( 2 ) intraoperative fentanyl This Editorial View accompanies the following article : Hadzic A , Arliss J , Kerimoglu B , Karaca PE , Yufa M , Claudio RE , Vloka JD , Rosenquist R , Santos AC , Thys DM : A comparison of infraclavic - ular nerve block versus general anesthesia for hand and wrist day - case surgeries .

Our group’s work has shown that each postoperative nursing intervention is associ - ated with a 27 - to 45 - min delay in discharge , 3 a notion corroborated by Kitz et al . , 6 who showed that postop - erative administration of controlled analgesics is more costly than the administration of noncontrolled analge - sics . These studies refute the intuitive notion that simply administering more intraoperative opioids via con - ventional bolus methods will prevent discharge time increases . To my knowledge , advanced opioid dosing techniques ( e . g . , target - controlled infusions ) have not been compared with RA techniques with respect to analgesic outcome differences . Recently developed target - controlled infusion technol - ogies 7 could in theory obviate the need for RA tech - niques to produce an ideal analgesic recovery proﬁle after invasive outpatient orthopedic surgery . This may be especially true if target - controlled opioid dosing was associated with lower rates of postoperative nausea and / or vomiting ( PONV ) and other opioid - related side effects . However , limited evidence available shows high incidences of PONV after both target - controlled remifen - tanil ( 27 % nausea , 10 % vomiting ) 8 and alfentanil ( 30 % nausea ) infusions . 9 The alfentanil target - controlled study group was compared to patients receiving conventional perioperative morphine boluses , and both treatment groups had a postoperative nausea rate of 30 % . 9 Sepa - rating the therapeutic index of opioid analgesia and the “toxic index” of opioid - induced PONV ( and other unde - sirable side effects for outpatients ) may prove to be a daunting task . If the following scenarios were to occur , a signiﬁcant clinical advance would be made , perhaps obviating the pressing need for labor - intensive RA anal - gesic procedures in complex orthopedic outpatient pro - cedures : ( 1 ) a synthetic parenteral opioid that does not produce PONV in therapeutic analgesic doses ; ( 2 ) ap - propriate supporting technology for a target - controlled infusion with this opioid ; and ( 3 ) a reliable oral opioid with low diversion potential ( i . e . , low street value ) that produces therapeutic analgesic levels free from nausea / vomiting , somnolence , respiratory depression , pruritus , urinary retention , and constipation . The scenario de - scribed above does not even account for the PONV risk associated with volatile agent use when compared with the use of total intravenous propofol GA . Opioids are not the sole analgesic option for outpatient surgery ; multimodal analgesia is an important concept . Pavlin et al . 5 showed that intraoperative parenteral ke - torolac predicted ( 1 ) lower use / consumption of periop - erative fentanyl , ( 2 ) less PONV , and ( 3 ) faster discharge time . Whether parecoxib 10 , 11 has a similar impact as does ketorolac in reducing PONV and providing faster discharge time remains to be seen . In either case , there is likely a procedural pain threshold above which it seems unlikely that nonsteroidal antiinﬂammatory drugs would be sufﬁcient , rendering nerve blocks potentially valuable in reducing discharge times and avoiding un - Table 1 .

These “procedural pain thresholds” require further research . Two recent retrospective studies of outpatient anes - thesia for hand surgery showed RA patients to have faster discharge times . In one , intravenous regional ( Bier ) block patients had faster discharge times than did GA and axillary block patients ( by 32 and 48 min , re - spectively ) 12 ; in another , wrist block patients for carpal tunnel release were discharged sooner versus Bier block and GA patients ( by 23 and 65 min , respectively ) . 13 The GA groups in both studies used simple bolus dosing of opioids , as did the current study by Hadzic et al . 1 Discharge time improvements shown by the aforemen - tioned hand surgery studies have not yet translated to other outpatient orthopedic procedures . While calling for potential change in their institution’s discharge pro - cesses , Collins et al . 14 reported a 7 - min improvement in hospital discharge time when an RA program was devel - oped for outpatient foot surgery . In another randomized trial ( n (cid:1) 60 , knee arthroscopy patients ) , Jankowski et al . 15 provided spinal , psoas - compartment lumbar plexus block , or GA and found no differences in discharge times , but these authors required voiding in all patients , a require - ment which may no longer be necessary in low - risk pa - tients undergoing regional / neuraxial techniques . 16 It is difﬁcult to generalize meaningful hospital stafﬁng / cost - saving beneﬁts if RA techniques were used as op - posed to GA - only techniques ( via PACU bypass or same - day discharge time reductions or both ) . Generally speaking , if the conversion from GA to RA techniques encompassed only 25 – 100 cases / yr , it seems highly un - likely that the duration - of - stay beneﬁts would translate to meaningful reductions in hospital expenditures ( for staff - ing etc . ) . However , if 500 – 3 , 000 (cid:3) cases / yr were con - verted from GA to RA and the results ( PACU bypass , reduced duration of stay ) by Hadzic et al . 1 were able to be generalized to all cases / case categories subject to the anesthesia process transformation , it seems more likely that actual cost savings would be tenable . 17 – 20 The threshold is unknown for the proportion of outpatients requiring GA - to - RA conversions to produce meaningful hospital cost advantages . Our group studied 1 , 432 consecutive outpatients un - dergoing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and more invasive knee procedures . 17 – 20 In our institution , these procedures were associated with a 17 % unplanned admission rate when GA was used ( without nerve blocks ) ; GA was used 90 % of the time ( and nerve blocks none of the time ) before July 1996 . Nerve blocks evolved as the centerpiece of analgesia during the next 2 yr , leading to routine same - day discharge of complex knee surgery patients by 1998 , when all of these patients were previously admitted . 4 In addition to achieving routine same - day discharge after invasive outpatient orthopedic surgery ( associated with the routine use of nerve blocks ) , we designed a PACU bypass score to address speciﬁc needs of RA patients . Our scoring system was modeled after the 10 - point modiﬁed Aldrete score , 21 with special provisions forbidding the bypass of patients with any pain , PONV , shivering , pruritus , orthostatic symptoms , or hypoten - sion . We believed it was inefﬁcient to use a PACU nurse ( trained in critical care nursing ) for the treatment of postoperative patients who met the stated criteria . Sim - ilarly , we did not want to create “loopholes” in which patients were inappropriately transferred from the PACU , because patients can have pain or PONV without reﬂecting adversely on the Aldrete score . Hadzic et al . 1 used the modiﬁed Aldrete score of 9 or greater for PACU bypass ( if following these criteria to the letter , nerve block patients could never achieve a score of 10 because these patients cannot move their blocked upper extremity ) . Meanwhile , Jankowski et al . 15 used a Mayo Modiﬁed Discharge Scoring System score of 8 or greater to qualify for PACU bypass ; these criteria were based largely on the same modiﬁed Aldrete score criteria . Thankfully , Hadzic et al . 1 did not bypass patients who had pain scores higher than 3 ( out of 10 ) ; this is a loophole in both the Aldrete and the Mayo criteria ( be - cause pain is not evaluated in either of these ) . Other than our group’s criteria 17 – 20 and the Mayo criteria , the only other reported criteria are those by White and Song , 22 which were not designed for patients undergoing RA . The White - Song criteria allow PACU bypass for patients with ( 1 ) transient vomiting or retching or ( 2 ) moderate to severe pain controlled with intravenous analgesics , if all other parameter scores are perfect . The White - Song criteria do not address shivering or pruritus . 18 Table 1 lists my suggestion for merging clinically useful PACU bypass quality indicators . In conclusion , Hadzic et al . 1 demonstrate the possibil - ity of routinely using RA for peripheral orthopedic sur - gery in an effort to minimize same - day discharge times . Much work is required , especially via randomized con - trolled trials , to determine whether discharge time sav - ings are found whenever RA is used or whether emerg - ing pharmacology and technology ( e . g . , target - controlled opioid infusions ) may obviate the need for routine RA procedures in invasive outpatient orthopedic surgery . Standardizing PACU bypass criteria is an important step to render discharge time studies comparable , because nursing qualiﬁcations and stafﬁng ratios in the PACU versus phase II may be an important covariate in the study of discharge times . PACU bypass criteria should prohibit undue increases in phase II labor intensity by discharging ( or bypassing ) a patient without fully address - ing common labor intensive symptoms ( PONV and pain ) that are not in the forefront of critical care symptomatology ( as are airway management and hemodynamics ) .

Two Reports of Propofol Anesthesia Associated with Metabolic Acidosis in Adults CURRENT anesthetics are remarkably safe , with few patients experiencing obvious side effects . Nevertheless , it is essential that clinicians remain alert to the possibility of new anesthetic - related side effects and to previously described side effects occurring in novel circumstances . The current issue of A NESTHESIOLOGY contains two provoc - ative case reports that suggest that continuous propofol infusion during anesthesia in adult patients may result in metabolic acidosis . 1 , 2 The novelty of the two reports is the apparent occurrence of “propofol infusion syn - drome” during anesthesia in adults ; previous anecdotal reports have described severe , sporadic , occasionally fatal metabolic acidosis during continuous infusion of propofol for sedation of critically ill children 3 – 5 and adults . 6 , 7 Although the mechanism by which propofol produces sporadic lactic acidosis is unclear , evidence implicates poisoning of the electron transport chain 8 and impaired oxidation of long - chain fatty acids . 9 However , no previous reports have associated lactic acidosis with propofol infusion for surgical anesthesia in adults . Therefore , the current reports prompt the ques - tion of whether the authors have correctly interpreted their observations . The answer to that question hinges on the differential diagnosis of intraoperative metabolic acidosis . In anesthetized patients , the differential diagnosis of newly developed metabolic acidosis is rarely challeng - ing . Most commonly , intraoperative metabolic acidosis represents lactic acidosis resulting from an obvious cause , e . g . , lower body reperfusion after release of an aortic cross clamp or severe hemorrhagic shock . More recently , infusion of relatively large volumes of 0 . 9 % saline has been associated with the development of hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis . 10 – 14 However , in This Editorial View accompanies the following two articles : Burow BK , Johnson ME , Packer DL : Metabolic acidosis asso - ciated with propofol in the absence of other causative factors . A NESTHESIOLOGY 2004 ; 101 : 239 – 41 ; and Salengros J - C , Velghe - Lenelle C - E , Bollens R , Engelman E , Barvais L : Lactic acidosis during propofol – remifentanil anesthesia in an adult .

During anesthesia , the differential diagnosis of meta - bolic acidosis begins with direct measurements of pH and arterial carbon dioxide tension ( Pa CO 2 ) and calcula - tion of serum bicarbonate concentration ( [ HCO 3 (cid:4) ] ) and other derived variables , such as base excess . However , deviations of pH , Pa CO 2 , [ HCO 3 (cid:4) ] , and base excess from normal values do not provide etiologic information . If the etiology is not obvious , further data are required . The ﬁrst critical differential diagnostic point is to dis - tinguish between hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis and metabolic acidosis associated with excessive gener - ation of organic acids , such as lactate and ketones . Three commonly used tools are the anion gap , the strong ion difference , and individual measurements of the anions of organic acids . The anion gap is within the normal range in hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis but usually is in - creased in lactic acidosis as in several other pathologic states . Intraoperative calculation of the anion gap often requires a speciﬁc request for a serum [ CL (cid:4) ] , which many “stat” laboratories do not include in an electrolyte panel . Use of the strong ion difference , as part of the Fencl - Stewart approach , also requires measurement of electrolytes , including serum [ CL (cid:4) ] , and at least a serum albumin concentration , which together would provide sufﬁcient data to apply the recently proposed , simpliﬁed modiﬁcation of the Fencl - Stewart approach . 15 In addi - tion to calculation of the anion gap or the strong ion difference , quantiﬁcation of the anions of organic acids , such as serum lactate or serum ketones , may be indicated . Applying either approach to the two case reports in this issue of A NESTHESIOLOGY produces suggestive but not deﬁnitive information . Burow et al . 1 describe a 31 - yr - old woman receiving a continuous propofol infusion for seda - tion during radiofrequency ablation for chronic atrial ﬁbril - lation . Propofol sedation was initiated at 25 (cid:3) g · kg (cid:4) 1 · min (cid:4) 1 and titrated to between 50 and 125 (cid:3) g · kg (cid:4) 1 · min (cid:4) 1 based on patient responsiveness . No more than 3 l saline solution , 0 . 9 % , was infused during 395 min of propofol sedation . Intermittently obtained arterial blood gas measurements showed a steady decline in pH , [ HCO 3 (cid:4) ] , and base excess without evidence of hypoperfu - sion , hypoxemia , or hypercapnia . Because no data were obtained to quantify the anion gap , the strong ion gap , or the anions of organic acids , hyperchloremic acidosis can - not be excluded . However , after the propofol infusion was discontinued , accompanied by the administration of 15 mEq sodium bicarbonate and mild mechanical hyper - ventilation , pH returned toward normal values . Salengros et al . 2 describe a 64 - yr - old man receiving a total intravenous anesthetic ( propofol , remifentanil , and mivacurium ) for a radical prostatectomy for adenocarci - noma . During the third hour of the case , the patient’s heart rate increased . At that time , pH , Pa CO 2 , [ HCO 3 (cid:4) ] , and serum lactate were normal . During the remaining 2 h of the case , pH and [ HCO 3 (cid:4) ] progressively declined , and serum lactate increased . Intravenous ﬂuid therapy consisted of 1 l saline , 0 . 9 % , and 1 l hydroxyethyl starch , 6 % . Hemodynamic variables other than tachycardia re - mained acceptable , and no other metabolic derange - ments were evident by laboratory analysis . The surgical procedure ended shortly after the second arterial blood gas measurement showed a worsening metabolic acido - sis . The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit , and his acid – base status returned to baseline over the next several hours . These two provocative cases are interesting because they describe the development of reversible metabolic acidosis associated with propofol anesthesia as the most likely explanation . The acidosis described by Burow et al . 1 could have resulted from saline infusion , although this is unlikely , given the time course and volume of infusion . In addition , the acidemia resolved despite con - tinued infusion of saline . This report would be more convincing had electrolyte data been obtained or had lactate been measured . The report by Salengros et al . 2 is more convincing because measurement of serum lactate conﬁrms the diagnosis of lactic acidosis . Hypoperfusion seems to be an unlikely explanation because blood pres - sure was well maintained , although abrupt onset of tachycardia was noted . Diabetic ketoacidosis was ex - cluded , and hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis is also unlikely , given the volume and time course of ﬂuid infusion . Cytopathic hypoxia secondary to sepsis is un - likely because , of the diagnostic criteria for sepsis or systemic inﬂammatory response syndrome as deﬁned by the 1992 American College of Chest Physicians / Society of Critical Care Medicine consensus conference , 16 only tachycardia was present . Before infusion , the propofol had not been drawn into syringes and stored for an extended interval , which has been associated with sep - sis . 17 Therefore , these two reports are most consistent with the possibility that occasionally , in adults , propofol in sufﬁciently high concentrations may itself produce a type of cytopathic hypoxia by impairing the electron transport chain or fatty acid oxidation . What should anesthesiologists conclude on the basis of these two case reports ? Unexpected tachycardia occur - ring during propofol anesthesia should prompt labora - tory evaluation for possible lactic acidosis . The most cost - effective approach would be to request an arterial blood gas measurement and an immediate serum lactate measurement . Given the suspicion of lactic acidosis , documentation of an increased anion gap or strong ion difference would necessitate additional studies and fur - ther delay treatment . “Propofol infusion syndrome” will likely be identiﬁed in additional anesthetized patients .
