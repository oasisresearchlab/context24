Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol 285 : H1113 – H1122 , 2003 . First published May 22 , 2003 ; 10 . 1152 / ajpheart . 00302 . 2003 . — Caveolae are plasmalemmal domains enriched with choles - terol , caveolins , and signaling molecules . Endothelial cells in vivo are continuously exposed to shear conditions , and their caveolae density and location may be different from that of static cultured cells . Here , we show that chronic shear expo - sure regulates formation and localization of caveolae and caveolin - 1 in bovine aortic endothelial cells ( BAEC ) . Chronic exposure ( 1 or 3 days ) of BAEC to laminar shear increased the total number of caveolae by 45 – 48 % above static control . This increase was due to a rise in the luminal caveolae density without changing abluminal caveolae numbers or increasing caveolin - 1 mRNA and protein levels . Whereas some caveolin - 1 was found in the plasma membrane in static - cultured cells , it was predominantly localized in the Golgi . In contrast , chronic shear - exposed cells showed intense caveo - lin - 1 staining in the luminal plasma membrane with mini - mum Golgi association . The preferential luminal localization of caveolae may play an important role in endothelial mech - anosensing . Indeed , we found that chronic shear exposure ( preconditioning ) altered activation patterns of two well - known shear - sensitive signaling molecules ( ERK and Akt ) in response to a step increase in shear stress . ERK activation was blunted in shear preconditioned cells , whereas the Akt response was accelerated . These results suggest that chronic shear stimulates caveolae formation by translocating caveo - lin - 1 from the Golgi to the luminal plasma membrane and alters cell signaling responses . caveolin - 1 ; mechanosensing ; atherosclerosis SHEAR STRESS REGULATES vascular endothelial cells both acutely and chronically by controlling production of autocrine and paracrine vasoactive factors ( 7 ) . Through these endothelial responses , shear stress con - trols vascular tone , vessel wall remodeling , binding of blood circulating cells to endothelium , and hemostasis ( 7 ) . Shear stress selectively and differentially regulates expression of many genes that are important in patho - physiology of vessel wall function ( 5 ) . Induction of speciﬁc genes by shear stress in endothelial cells is mediated by the activation of mechanosensitive signal - ing pathways that include at least three members of the mitogen - activated protein ( MAP ) kinase family : extracellular signal - regulated kinase 1 / 2 ( ERK1 / 2 ) , c - Jun NH 2 - terminal kinase ( JNK ) , and big MAP kinase 1 ( 18 , 44 ) . The mechanism by which endothelial cells recognize changes in shear stress ( mechanosensing ) and control activation of multiple signaling pathways in a well - orchestrated manner is not well understood . Several potential mechanosensing systems have been proposed including cytoskeleton / integrins ( 4 , 43 ) , G proteins ( 14 ) , K (cid:1) channels ( 26 ) , adherens junction proteins ( 37 ) , and caveolae ( 27 , 28 , 30 ) . Caveolae are noncoated micropatches of the plasma membrane with a variety of shapes ( ﬂat , invaginated , and tubular ) and are found in most cell types , includ - ing endothelial cells , ﬁbroblasts , smooth muscle cells , and adipocytes ( 1 , 25 ) . They carry out at least two different functions : 1 ) transport of large and small molecules , and 2 ) transmembrane cell signaling cen - ters ( 25 ) . We have shown evidence suggesting that caveolae play an important role in regulation of the ERK path - way by manipulating two of its critical components , plasmalemmal cholesterol and caveolin - 1 ( 27 , 28 ) . These studies examined the response of endothelial cells cultured under static conditions to acute shear . Currently , most investigators , including us , in this ﬁeld use static cultured cells as a physiologically “nor - mal” control . This is necessary due to technical con - straints of culturing cells under shear conditions . How - ever , most vascular endothelial cells in vivo are contin - uously exposed to shear stress and static cultured cells may not represent true “control conditions . ” Although static cultured cells have been extremely valuable in dissecting endothelial responses to mechanical force , their phenotypes and responses may not represent those occurring under physiological conditions in vivo .

We hypothesized that caveolae density in the cell surface may be critical in mechanosensing and subse - quent mechanosensitive cell signaling . To test this , we examined whether chronic laminar shear exposure changes formation of caveolae , subcellular localization of caveolin - 1 , and activation of two well - known mech - anosensitive signaling proteins ( ERK and Akt ) in cul - tured bovine aortic endothelial cells ( BAEC ) . Here , we show that chronic laminar shear stress induces trans - location of caveolin - 1 from the Golgi to the plasma membrane , increases caveolae formation preferentially at the luminal surface , and changes the activation patterns of ERK and Akt . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture . BAEC harvested from descending thoracic aortas were maintained ( 37°C , 5 % CO 2 ) in a growth medium [ DMEM ( 1 g / l glucose , Mediatech ) containing 20 % FCS ( At - lanta Biologicals ) without antibiotics ] ( 17 ) . Cells used in this study were between passages 3 and 10 . Shear stress studies . Cells were exposed to unidirectional laminar shear stress with the use of a parallel - plate shear chamber or a cone - and - plate viscometer as described by us previously ( 13 ) . Preparation of RNA or cell lysates . Total cell RNA was extracted from endothelial cells with the use of a RNEasy Mini Kit ( Qiagen ; Valencia , CA ) according to the manufac - turer’s instructions . cDNA was prepared from total RNA with SuperScript II ( Invitrogen ; Carlsbad , CA ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . For protein analysis , cells were washed in ice - cold PBS , scraped in 0 . 5 ml of lysis buffer composed of 60 mM octylglucoside , 10 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 150 mM NaCl , 1 . 0 % Triton X - 100 , 1 . 0 mM sodium orthovanadate , and 0 . 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride ( 28 , 45 ) , solubi - lized for 30 min at 4°C , and centrifuged at 8 , 000 g for 15 min . The protein content of solubilized lysates was measured with the use of a DC assay kit ( Bio - Rad ; Hercules , CA ) ( 18 ) . Northern blot analysis . Total RNA ( 10 (cid:2) g ) was added to each lane of a 1 % agarose gel then transferred to a nylon membrane ( Schleicher and Schuell ; Keene , NH ) . The RNA was UV cross - linked to the membrane with the use of Str - atalinker ( Stragene ; La Jolla , CA ) . The blot was prehybrid - ized with 1 M NaCl , 5 (cid:3) Denhardt’s solution , 50 mM Tris , pH 7 . 4 , 50 % Formamide , 0 . 5 % SDS ( wt / vol ) , and 0 . 01 % salmon sperm DNA ( vol / vol ) fo r 2 h at 42°C in a hybridization oven ( Thermo Hybrid ; Franklin , MA ) before an overnight hybrid - ization ( prehybridization solution containing 50 (cid:2) Ci [ (cid:4) - 32 P ] dCTP but without Denhardt’s solution ) and probed with cDNA speciﬁc for caveolin - 1 ( 5 (cid:5) - GTATTTGCCCCCAGA - CATGCTGGC - 3 (cid:5) ) ( 32 ) . The blots were afﬁxed to a Phosphor screen ( Molecular Dynamics ; Sunnyvale , CA ) and scanned on an autoradiography system ( Storm ; Molecular Dynamics ) . Densiometric quantiﬁcation was performed with the use of Image software ( Scion ; Frederick , MD ) and normalized to 18S rRNA . Western blotting . Total lysates ( 20 (cid:2) g / well ) were resolved by 10 % SDS - PAGE , transferred to a polyvinylidine diﬂuoride membrane ( Millipore ; Bedford , MA ) , and probed with anti - bodies speciﬁc to caveolin - 1 , endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ; Transduction Laboratories , Lexington ; KY ) and actin ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology ; Santa Cruz , CA ) . Goat anti - rabbit or anti - mouse IgG - conjugated to alkaline phosphatase was used as a secondary antibody ( Bio - Rad ) , and the mem - brane was developed by a chemiluminescent detection method ( New England Biolabs ; Beverly , MA ) ( 18 ) . Densio - metric quantiﬁcation was performed with the use of Scion Image software . Transmission electron microscopy and immunotransmis - sion electron microscopy . BAEC were cultured in 100 mm tissue culture dishes and grown to conﬂuence . Cells were exposed to laminar shear stress ( 19 dyn / cm 2 ) or remained static for 1 or 3 days . After shear stress , the cells were ﬁxed for 1 h at 4°C on ice with 1 . 6 % paraformaldehyde and 3 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate buffer ( pH 7 . 3 ) , washed with 0 . 1 M sodium cacodylate and 3 . 5 % sucrose buffer ( pH 7 . 3 ) , and then postﬁxed for 1 h with 1 % Palade’s OsO 4 . Cells were stained en bloc with Kellenberger’s uranyl acetate , dehydrated , embedded in epoxy resin , and sectioned ( 28 ) . Ultrathin sections were examined with the use of trans - mission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , and random ﬁelds ( each ﬁeld containing part of one or two cells ) were photographed . As suggested by Schnitzer et al . ( 35 ) , only distinctly ﬂask - shaped , noncoated vesicles ( 50 – 100 nm in diameter ) found on the luminal and abluminal plasma membranes were scored as caveolae . Total caveolae counts were normalized to the unit length of plasma membrane measured with the use of Image Pro software ( Media Cybernetics ; Silver Spring , MD ) . We also tracked caveolae counts for the luminal or abluminal surfaces for each micrograph . For immuno - TEM , BAEC were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformal - dehyde and 0 . 1 % glutaraldehyde in 100 mM phosphate buffer ( PB ) ( pH 7 . 4 ) for 30 min , followed by 1 % paraformal - dehyde in PB at 4°C overnight . The samples were rinsed four times in PB then blocked in 0 . 1 % sodium borohydride in PB for 15 min , rinsed four times in PB , blocked a second time in 0 . 05 % saponin , 5 % BSA , 0 . 1 % gelatin , and 5 % serum in PBS for 60 min , then rinsed three times with 0 . 05 % saponin and 0 . 1 % BSA in PBS . The primary antibody ( polyclonal caveo - lin - 1 , Transduction Laboratories ) was incubated overnight at 4°C in PBS with 0 . 05 % saponin and 0 . 1 % BSA , then rinsed six times in PBS containing 0 . 05 % saponin and 0 . 1 % BSA , and incubated with the ultrasmall gold conjugated secondary antibody ( Aurion ; Wageningen , The Netherlands ) in PBS containing 0 . 05 % saponin and 0 . 1 % BSA for 4 h at 4°C . Afterward , the samples were rinsed six times in PBS con - taining 0 . 05 % saponin and 0 . 1 % BSA , then three times in PBS . The samples were then postﬁxed with 2 . 0 % glutaralde - hyde in PB for 1 h , rinsed four times in PB , and then four times in enhancement conditioning solution ( ECS ) solution ( Aurion ) . For silver enhancement , sections were agitated in a solution ( R - gent SE - EM ; Aurion ) at room temperature for 30 min , then placed in a stop bath of 30 mM sodium thiosulfate in ECS solution for 5 min , and rinsed four times in ECS solution . The sections were then examined as described above in TEM . Confocal immunoﬂuorescence microscopy . After shear ex - posure , cells were rinsed with PBS , then ﬁxed and perme - ablized for 20 min with the use of Cytoﬁx / Cytoperm ( Phar - Mingen ) . They were rinsed twice with 1 (cid:3) Perm / Wash buffer ( PharMingen ) , quenched with 50 mM NH 4 Cl for 10 min , rinsed twice with PBS , and then blocked for 1 h with 3 % BSA in PBS . Circular areas ( (cid:6)(cid:7) 12 mm ) were isolated on the plate with the use of a Pap Pen ( Electron Microscopy Supplies ; Ft . Washington , PA ) and incubated with a polyclonal antibody speciﬁc to caveolin - 1 ( pCav - 1 ) or cis - Golgi ( GM130 ) either 1 h at RT or overnight at 4°C . Afterward , the isolated area was rinsed with PBS , then PBS containing 3 % BSA as before , followed by treatment fo r 1 h atroom temperature with an appropriate ﬂuorescently labeled secondary antibody ( Alex - H1114 CAVEOLAE FORMATION AND CELL SIGNALING CHANGES AJP - Heart Circ Physiol • VOL 285 • SEPTEMBER 2003 • www . ajpheart . org b y 10 . 220 . 32 . 246 on A p r il 30 , 2017 h tt p : / / a j phea r t . ph ys i o l og y . o r g / D o w n l oaded f r o m aﬂuor 488 for green or Alexaﬂuor 568 for red ; Molecular Probes ) . The labeled cells were treated with an anti - fade medium ( Prolong , Molecular Probes ) and observed with a confocal microscope ( model 510 Axiovert , Zeiss ) . Chronic shear effects on subsequent acute shear activation of ERK and Akt . BAEC were exposed to 24 h of static culture or chronic shear at 10 dyn / cm 2 ( preconditioning ) for 24 h , then the shear level was increased to 20 dyn / cm 2 for a time course of 0 , 5 , 30 , and 60 min . The static culture to 20 dyn / cm 2 and 10 dyn / cm 2 to 20 dyn / cm 2 samples are referred to as “static - to - shear” and “shear - to - shear , ” respectively . Samples were analyzed with Western blots for ERK and Akt ( protein kinase B ) phosphorylation and total protein using antibodies speciﬁc to each protein state ( Cell Signaling ) . Statistical analysis . Statistical analysis was performed with the use of Student’s t - test with P (cid:8) 0 . 05 considered signiﬁcant . RESULTS Chronic laminar shear exposure aligns endothelial cell shape and changes density and subcellular location of caveolae . To determine whether chronic exposure of endothelial cells under shear stress conditions regu - lates the formation and subcellular location of caveo - lae , BAEC monolayers were exposed to laminar shear or static conditions for 1 or 3 day ( s ) , and examined by light microscopy and TEM . As expected , the BAECs grown in static conditions showed typical polygonal cobblestone shapes , whereas the cells subjected to lam - inar shear ( 19 dyn / cm 2 ) for 1 day showed alignment toward the imposed ﬂow direction ( Fig . 1 ) . The same effect on alignment was observed by 3 days of laminar shear exposure ( data not shown ) . These cells exposed to laminar shear or static condi - tions were then ﬁxed and analyzed by TEM . As indi - cated by arrows in Fig . 2 , plasmalemmal caveolae were found in both luminal ( apical ) and abluminal ( basal ) surfaces in cells exposed to static culture ( Fig . 2 , A – C ) or chronic shear ( Fig . 2 , D – F ) conditions . To determine whether shear stress changed the caveolae density , we counted the total caveolae per unit length . When BAEC were exposed to laminar shear for 1 or 3 day ( s ) , the total number of caveolae per micron of plasma membrane signiﬁcantly increased by 45 % and 48 % , respectively , over that of static control ( 1 day : static (cid:9) 0 . 124 (cid:10) 0 . 013 caveolae / (cid:2) m , n (cid:9) 60 different micro - graphs taken from three different experiments ; shear (cid:9) 0 . 180 (cid:10) 0 . 017 caveolae / (cid:2) m , n (cid:9) 43 , P (cid:9) 0 . 009 ; 3 days : static (cid:9) 0 . 23 (cid:10) 0 . 03 caveolae / (cid:2) m , n (cid:9) 33 ; shear (cid:9) 0 . 34 (cid:10) 0 . 03 caveolae / (cid:2) m , n (cid:9) 23 , P (cid:9) 0 . 02 ) ( Fig . 3 A ) . The density of caveolae was higher in cells cultured for 3 days under static conditions than that of 1 day ( Fig . 3 A ) . This may be due to the time in static culture after reaching conﬂuency . Nevertheless , shear exposure induced similar fold stimulation in caveolae density in both cases ( Fig . 3 A ) . While we quantiﬁed the total number of caveolae , we noticed a difference in their luminal and abluminal distribution . As shown in Fig . 3 B , caveolae numbers per micrograph in static cultured cells were equally distributed in the luminal and abluminal surface ( 1 day : luminal (cid:9) 2 . 57 (cid:10) 0 . 30 , abluminal (cid:9) 3 . 04 (cid:10) 0 . 41 ; 3 days : luminal (cid:9) 3 . 42 (cid:10) 0 . 47 , abluminal (cid:9) 5 . 48 (cid:10) 0 . 97 ) . In contrast , the caveo - lae number in cells exposed to chronic laminar shear increased only at the luminal surface by 80 ( 1 day ) and 300 % ( 3 days ) over static controls ( P (cid:8) 0 . 001 ) with no changes in abluminal numbers ( 1 day : luminal (cid:9) 4 . 64 (cid:10) 0 . 54 , abluminal (cid:9) 3 . 03 (cid:10) 0 . 32 , P (cid:9) 0 . 01 ; 3 days : luminal (cid:9) 10 . 35 (cid:10) 1 . 01 , abluminal (cid:9) 3 . 61 (cid:10) 0 . 77 , P (cid:8) 0 . 001 ) . To determine whether the preferred increase in lu - minal caveolae coincided with an increase in caveolin - 1 protein , we conducted immuno - TEM with a caveolin - 1 antibody . BAEC were subject to either static culture ( Fig . 4 A ) or 24 h of laminar shear stress ( Fig . 4 B ) , then incubated with a polyclonal caveolin - 1 antibody , fol - lowed by a gold particle - conjugated secondary anti - body , which was silver enhanced , as shown in Fig . 4 . In static cultured cells , the subcellular distribution of caveolin - 1 was approximately the same for luminal and abluminal surfaces . However , when the cells were exposed to chronic laminar shear , caveolin - 1 staining increased at the luminal surface . Figure 4 C shows a magniﬁed view of caveolin - 1 - positive vesicles , as well as single and racemose caveolae . In static cultured cells , we also observed caveolin - 1 staining intracellu - larly ( Fig . 4 , A and B , arrows ) clearly distinguishable from those associated with the cell surface ( presum - Fig . 1 . Laminar shear stress aligns bo - vine aortic endothelial cells ( BAEC ) .

Because of the permeablization condi - tions used ( 0 . 05 % saponin ) , it was difﬁcult to discern the exact subcellular structure where caveolin - 1 was found . These results suggest that chronic exposure of endothelial cells to laminar shear stress increases the number of caveolae and caveolin - 1 preferentially on the luminal surface . Shear stress decreases expression of caveolin - 1 mRNA and protein . Because caveolin - 1 is the principle protein of caveolae , we initially hypothesized that the increase in the luminal caveolae numbers were due to increased caveolin - 1 expression . To examine this hy - pothesis , caveolin - 1 mRNA and protein expression were determined . First , BAEC were exposed to laminar shear over a time course of up to 18 h , and caveolin - 1 mRNA levels were analyzed by Northern blot analysis . To our sur - prise , shear exposure decreased caveolin - 1 mRNA level in a time - dependent manner ( Fig . 5 ) . The decrease was obvious as early as 2 h after shear onset with a maxi - mum 80 % reduction compared with static control by 18 h ( 21 (cid:10) 5 % , n (cid:9) 3 , P (cid:8) 0 . 001 ) ( Fig . 5 , top ) . To examine whether the endothelial cells responded to shear in an expected manner , we also determined the mRNA levels of eNOS , a gene known to be increased by shear ( 8 ) . As expected , laminar shear increased the eNOS mRNA level in a time - dependent manner , pro - viding a positive internal control ( Fig . 5 , middle ) . The ethidium bromide staining demonstrates equal RNA loading ( Fig . 5 , bottom ) . Next , we examined the caveolin - 1 protein level in BAEC exposed to chronic laminar shear ( Fig . 6 ) . The caveolin - 1 protein level slowly decreased by 40 % of static control over 3 days of continuous shear exposure ( 61 . 3 (cid:10) 6 . 5 % , P (cid:9) 0 . 0002 ) ( Fig . 6 , top ) . However , within 1 day of shear onset , no detectable difference was observed in caveolin - 1 protein ( Fig . 6 , top left ) . We again observed increased eNOS protein expression in response to laminar shear , which served as a positive control ( 23 ) ( Fig . 6 , middle ) . In addition , actin protein level , which did not change in response to shear stress , was used as an additional internal control ( Fig . 6 , bottom ) . These results showed that chronic exposure of endo - thelial cells to shear stress did not increase caveolin - 1 protein levels as determined by Western blot analysis . Fig . 2 .

Yet , in response to chronic shear exposure , this pool of caveolin - 1 proteins may be made available to form caveolae in the luminal plasma membrane without requiring new protein syn - thesis . Caveolin - 1 preferentially localizes to the Golgi and plasma membrane in static and sheared BAEC , respec - tively . To determine whether there is an excess intra - cellular caveolin - 1 protein pool , BAEC that were sub - jected to chronic shear or static control were examined by confocal microscopy with the use of a caveolin - 1 antibody ( Fig . 7 ) . In static control cells , caveolin - 1 was found both in the plasma membrane and perinuclear region ( Fig . 7 , arrows , top left ) . However , the majority of caveolin - 1 protein was found in the perinuclear re - gion . To determine whether the perinuclear regions corresponded to the Golgi , the cells were stained with a cis - Golgi - speciﬁc antibody ( GM - 130 ) . As shown in Fig . 7 , middle , the Golgi was identiﬁed as a perinuclear structure . When the two images of caveolin - 1 and Golgi were merged , the perinuclear caveolin - 1 staining over - lapped with that of the cis - Golgi ( Fig . 7 , top right ) , suggesting their colocalization . In contrast , when BAEC were exposed to 1 day of laminar shear , caveo - lin - 1 staining pattern changed dramatically . Instead of the pronounced perinuclear staining , caveolin - 1 was mainly detected at the cell periphery , a characteristic of plasmalemmal caveolae ( arrows , Fig . 7 , bottom left ) . Merged images of caveolin - 1 and the Golgi ( Fig . 7 , arrow , bottom middle ) in shear - exposed cells displayed that caveolin - 1 no longer colocalized with the Golgi marker ( Fig . 7 , bottom right ) . These results suggest that shear stress changes preferential location of caveolin - 1 from the Golgi to plasma membrane . These results are consistent with the immuno - TEM data shown in Fig . 4 . Chronic shear alters ERK and Akt activation re - sponse to subsequent acute increases in shear . Previ - ously we ( 2 , 13 , 18 , 27 ) have shown that a sudden exposure of static cultured cells to laminar shear stress ( “static - to - shear” ) activates ERK and Akt ( protein ki - nase B ) in a time - dependent manner . Furthermore , we ( 27 , 28 ) have shown evidence that caveolae play a critical role in shear - dependent activation of ERK . Be - cause our current results showed that chronic exposure of endothelial cells to laminar shear stress ( precondi - tioning ) increased luminal caveolin - 1 protein level and caveolae numbers , we decided to determine whether the preconditioned cells would respond to a subsequent acute change in shear stress ( “shear - to - shear” ) differ - ently than that of static cultured cells with the use of ERK and Akt as markers . Fig . 6 . Shear stress decreases caveolin - 1 protein expression . BAEC were exposed to shear or static control for 1 and 3 days and 20 (cid:2) g of total cell lysate used for Western protein analysis per sample . Total caveolin - 1 was immunoblotted with the monoclonal antibody 2297 , which detects both the (cid:4) - and (cid:11) - isoforms ( top ) .

Shear stress level was then increased to 20 dyn / cm 2 ( acute shear ) for a time course of 0 , 5 , 30 , and 60 min ( Fig . 8 A ) . As shown in Fig . 8 B , static cultured BAEC responded as expected showing a transient stimulation of ERK phosphorylation with a maximum activation by 5 min and returning to basal levels by 60 min in response to acute shear exposure ( acute shear ) . In contrast , ERK activation of the precon - ditioned cells in response to the acute shear stress chal - lenge was virtually blunted ( Fig . 8 B ) . As we have shown previously ( 2 , 13 ) , exposure of static cultured BAEC to acute shear increase ( static - to - shear ) stimulated phos - phorylation of Akt in a progressive manner as a function of time reaching a maximum fourfold increase by 60 min ( Fig . 8 B ) . On the other hand , the acute shear exposure of preconditioned BAEC revealed that maximum phosphor - ylation of Akt occurred as early as 5 min and was main - tained for as long as 60 min ( Fig . 8 B ) . To test whether the differential activation was due to differences in the changes in shear magnitude , we performed similar ex - periments with the exception of raising the acute shear level to 10 dyn / cm 2 by using the static cultured cells . No signiﬁcant difference between “0 - to - 10 dyn / cm 2 ” and “0 - to - 20 dyn / cm 2 ” was observed in the phosphorylation pat - terns of Akt and ERK ( data not shown ) . These results demonstrate that acute changes in laminar shear stress level in chronically precondi - tioned endothelial cells blunt ERK response while ac - celerating the response time of another mechanosensi - tive signaling protein Akt . Fig . 8 . Chronic shear exposure alters activa - tion patterns of ERK and Akt by a subsequent step shear change ( acute shear ) . BAEC were exposed to laminar shear ( 10 dyn / cm 2 ) or static control for 1 day . The static cultured cells were then exposed to an acute shear ( “0 - to - 20” dyn / cm 2 ) for a time course of 5 , 30 , and 60 min , whereas the chronically sheared ( preconditioned ) cells were exposed to an acute shear ( “10 - to - 20” dyn / cm 2 ) for the same time course ( A ) . Activation of ERK and Akt was analyzed by Western blot with the use of cell lysates with antibodies to phosphorylated forms of ERK and Akt , respectively , and quantitated by densitometry . Line graphs represent means (cid:10) SE ( n (cid:9) 3 – 5 ; * and * * P (cid:8) 0 . 05 ) . Membranes probed with phosphory - lated ERK and Akt were stripped and re - probed with antibodies speciﬁc to total ERK and Akt , respectively , as internal controls .

Our TEM results showed that after 1 and 3 day ( s ) of exposure of endothelial cells to laminar shear , the total number of caveolae increased compared with static control . We also found that this increase was preferen - tially observed at the luminal surface with no signiﬁ - cant change observed at the abluminal surface . In microvascular endothelial cells , preferential localiza - tion of caveolae to the luminal or abluminal surface has been reported in different tissues ( 3 , 19 , 39 ) . Schnitzer et al . ( 34 ) reported that cultured microvascular endo - thelial cells have fewer plasmalemmal vesicles com - pared with endothelial cells in situ though they did not quantify the reduction . They also showed differences in the number of plasmalemmal vesicles , presumably caveolae , between cell types ( bovine pulmonary aorta , vein , and microvascular endothelial cells ) during cul - ture , but it was unknown what role ambient culture conditions played ( i . e . , lack of shear stress ) ( 36 ) . The reduction in caveolae numbers in static culture could be due to the lack of ﬂuid ﬂow stimulation . If this were the case , chronic shear exposure of endothelial cells could produce a more physiologically relevant environment for them . Consistent with this concept , we found that chronic exposure of BAEC to laminar shear increases the total number of caveolae . More - over , we found that this increase in caveolae number occurred predominantly in the luminal surface , whereas it remained the same at the abluminal surface ( Fig . 3 ) . These results were consistent with our im - muno - TEM data with caveolin - 1 ( Fig . 4 ) . Because the number of caveolae increased with chronic laminar shear , we expected caveolin - 1 protein levels to also increase . To our surprise , we found a rapid reduction in caveolin - 1 mRNA expression within 18 h ( Fig . 5 ) and a slow and modest decrease in caveo - lin - 1 protein levels over 3 days of shear exposure ( Fig . 6 ) . However , the reduction in caveolin - 1 mRNA level in response to chronic shear is consistent with the result obtained from a DNA microarray study ( 21 ) . Whereas our caveolin - 1 protein result is similar to that reported by Isshiki et al . ( 16 ) , our caveolin - 1 mRNA results do not agree with those reported by Sun et al . ( 41 ) and Isshiki et al . ( 16 ) who used subconﬂuent endothelial cells . One reason that may be responsible for the dis - crepancy among these studies is cell conﬂuence be - cause it has been shown that caveolin - 1 expression dramatically changes as cells reach conﬂuency ( 11 ) . Another factor could be the caveolin - 1 antibodies used ( polyclonal Cav - 1 in our study vs . the N - 20 antibody used in Sun et al . ’s study ) . Pelkmans et al . ( 29 ) has shown previously that the N - 20 antibody does not detect caveolin - 1 present in the Golgi of CV - 1 cells . It was also shown by Luetterforst et al . ( 20 ) , that the speciﬁc antibodies raised against the NH 2 terminus and caveolin scaffolding domain detected either the plasma membrane or Golgi , but not both . We have shown that the polyclonal caveolin - 1 antibody binds to epitopes in both the scaffolding domain and NH 2 ter - minus ( 27 ) . This may explain our ability to detect caveolin - 1 in the plasma membrane as well as in the Golgi , whereas the N - 20 antibody may have excluded identiﬁcation of the large Golgi pool of caveolin - 1 in their immunoﬂuorescence study , resulting in the dis - crepancy between the two studies . The increased caveolae numbers without the con - comitant increase in caveolin - 1 protein led us to exam - ine caveolin - 1 localization using immunoﬂuorescence and confocal microscopy . Consistent with several pre - vious reports in static cultured endothelial cells , a major pool of caveolin - 1 was found in the Golgi ( 12 , 27 , 33 ) , and it was also found in the plasma membrane ( 9 ) ( Fig . 7 ) . Although caveolin - 1 did not colocalize to the Golgi in Chinese hamster ovary cells ( 22 ) , it did in other cell types , including baby hamster kidney cells , primary human ﬁbroblasts , C2C12 ( 20 ) , HeLa ( 42 ) , Madin - Darby canine kidney cells ( 9 ) , and CV - 1 ( 29 ) cells . Luetterforst et al . ( 20 ) , showed that a truncated caveolin - 1 and caveolin - 3 COOH terminus targets to the Golgi . They also demonstrated that this COOH terminus fused to a heterologous protein was sufﬁcient for colocalization with the Golgi . The preferential location of caveolin - 1 in the Golgi in static cultured BAEC may be due to the lack of physical environment including shear stress existing in vivo ( 24 ) . Consistent with this notion , in arterial endothe - lial cells in vivo , caveolin - 1 is preferentially associated with the plasma membrane ( 36 ) . Our study showed that chronic exposure of BAEC indeed changed the preferential localization of caveolin - 1 from the Golgi to the plasma membrane caveolae . The concept of caveo - lin - 1 translocation between plasmalemmal caveolae and the Golgi has been previously proposed in ﬁbro - blasts ( 40 ) . Conrad et al . ( 6 ) showed that caveolin - 1 cycles constitutively between the Golgi and the plasma membrane caveolae in both the microtubule - dependent and - independent mechanisms . Caveolin - 1 proteins ac - cumulating in the Golgi in cultured endothelial cells may represent an excess pool of caveolin - 1 that is not used for caveolae formation . For unknown reasons , caveolin - 1 proteins processed in the Golgi may not be transported to the plasma membrane under static cul - ture conditions . On challenge with laminar shear force , however , the excess caveolin - 1 protein may move from the Golgi to the plasma membrane forming caveolae without requiring new protein synthesis . Although chronic shear exposure decreases the caveolin - 1 mRNA level to 20 % of static control cells , this may be sufﬁcient for protein production even with the increased forma - tion of caveolae .

Proposed mechanosens - ing systems include cytoskeleton / integrins ( 4 , 43 ) , G proteins ( 14 ) , K (cid:1) channels ( 26 ) , adherens junction pro - teins ( 37 ) , and caveolae ( 27 , 28 , 30 ) . The preferential formation of caveolae at the luminal surface in re - sponse to chronic shear exposure strongly indicate the potential role for luminal caveolae as a major part the of mechanosensing system . Caveolae may directly sense changes in shear stress at the luminal surface . On the other hand , it is interesting to speculate that the cytoskeleton / integrins / focal adhesions may play a role in mechanosensing in the abluminal surface ( 15 , 38 , 43 ) , whereas intercellular adherens junctions may act as a basolateral mechanosensor ( 37 ) . The regional - ized distribution of the mechanosensors may provide a framework for the decentralization hypothesis that was proposed by Davies and colleague ( 7 , 15 ) , stating that for a given stress conﬁguration , several intracel - lular mechanisms respond and integrate a cellular response . The luminal formation of caveolae and caveolin - 1 may have a major impact on how the cells respond to the subsequent mechanical or humoral challenges . For example , endothelial cells grown under chronic shear conditions may respond differently to a subsequent physical or humoral stimulus compared with that of static cultured cells . Indeed , unlike with static cul - tured cells , we found that endothelial cells exposed to chronic laminar shear conditions ( preconditioning ) have a blunted ERK phosphorylation , whereas Akt activation is accelerated in response to the subsequent increase in shear stress ( acute shear ) . It is well known that laminar shear is atheroprotec - tive and inhibits endothelial proliferation , whereas low and unstable shear are proatherogenic ( 7 ) . It has been somewhat curious why exposure of static cultured cells to laminar shear stimulates ERK activity , which is normally linked to proliferative responses ( 18 ) . Most endothelial cells that are exposed to laminar shear in straight part of arteries have very low cell turnover rate , and those that do are usually found in atheroscle - rotic lesion - prone areas ( 7 ) . Endothelial cells in lesion - prone areas around branched or curved arteries are exposed to low and disturbed shear conditions ( 7 ) . Therefore , it is tempting to speculate that the ERK response to acute shear in static cells ( static to shear ) may represent a response of those in lesion - prone ar - eas . In contrast , endothelial cells preconditioned to laminar shear may represent those found in straight arteries showing very low cell proliferation . It is also interesting to note that endothelium in lesion - prone areas show a signiﬁcantly higher level of apoptosis than those in straight arteries ( 31 ) . Because Akt is a key antiapoptotic molecule , our result showing the accelerated response in shear preconditioned cells is consistent with the antiapoptotic effect of laminar shear . At present , it is not known why chronic shear expo - sure differentially altered the cell - signaling responses of ERK and Akt in response to a subsequent shear level change ( acute shear ) . This may be due to changes in formation or interaction of cell - signaling complexes in and around caveolae - like domains . There may be an optimum range of caveolin - 1 level that is required for proper regulation of mechanosensitive activation of ERK . Chronic shear exposure may regulate caveolae number and location for an optimal activation of cell signaling pathways . Previously , we have shown that removal of plasma membrane cholesterol using cyclo - dextrin or ﬁlipin , or inhibition of caveolin - 1 by a neu - tralizing antibody blocks shear stress - dependent acti - vation of ERK in static cultured cells ( 27 , 28 ) , demon - strating a critical role of caveolin - 1 and caveolae in this mechanoresponse . As discussed above , in static cul - tured cells , there seems to be an excess pool of caveo - lin - 1 in intracellular structures such as the Golgi , whereas a relatively small amount of caveolin - 1 is in caveolae . This distribution may have allowed for a transient and robust activation of ERK in a caveolae - dependent manner . On the other hand , chronic shear exposure induces relocation of caveolin - 1 and caveolae formation to the luminal cell surface . Because caveo - lin - 1 is a negative regulator of the ERK pathway ( 10 ) , relative increase in caveolin - 1 and caveolae induced by chronic shear may have resulted in blocking ERK ac - tivation by an acute shear . Alternatively , chronic shear exposure may have induced a desensitization mecha - nism that blocks further activation of ERK in response to the acute shear . In summary , we have shown here that chronic shear exposure controls the formation and localization of caveolae and caveolin - 1 in endothelial cells . We sug - gest that the luminal caveolae formation plays a criti - cal role in mechanosensing and subsequent mechano - sensitive cellular responses .
