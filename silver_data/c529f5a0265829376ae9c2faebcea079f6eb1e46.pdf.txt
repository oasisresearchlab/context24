V . , part of Springer Nature 2018 Abstract Design is a key element of both the teaching and learning of engineering and technology . However , the process of engineering design has yielded limited research results . This study explored the iterative design process by searching for sequential design thinking patterns . The researchers collected nine concurrent think - aloud protocols from fourth - grade elementary students . The study identified that idea generation plays a central role in design that features the dominant use of time . In addition , the researchers revealed significant pathways in design thinking and built a design pattern model . The results will not only help engineering and technology educators the understanding of design behavior , but also support the harmonious matching of learning and teaching styles in engineering and technology education . Keywords Design process · Design iteration · Design pattern · Protocol analysis · Design cognition Introduction Design is a key element of teaching and learning engineering and technology . Dym et al . ( 2005 ) noted that design has the unique feature of engineering , which involves a complex cognitive process . Katehi et al . ( 2009 ) emphasized design activities in engineering : “engi - neering is the process of designing the human - made world” ( p . 27 ) . Cross ( 2000 ) stated , “Everything around us that is not a simple untouched piece of nature has been designed by someone” ( p . 3 ) . The study of technology places a considerable emphasis on design . The publication for K - 12 technology education standards , Standards for Technological Literacy ( STL ) ( ITEEA 2000 / 2002 / 2007 ) explicitly underlines the core concepts of design , and the term design appears in 11 of the 20 standards . For example , standards 8 – 10 describe the * Euisuk Sung sunge @ purdue . edu 1 Department of Technology Leadership , and Innovation , Purdue University , 155S Grant Street Young Rm 345 , West Lafayette , IN 47906 , USA 284 E . Sung , T . R . Kelley 1 3 importance of design in technology education . The three standards endorsed the attributes of design , the relationship between technology and engineering design , and the role of engineering activities in technological problem - solving . In addition , the Next Generation Science Standards ( 2013 ) posit engineering design as a central approach to learning sci - ence . The science standards attribute engineering design with a similar importance to sci - entific inquiry . NGSS claims that K - 12 students should have the opportunity to practice the design approach , via authentic experiences to apply scientific knowledge into real - world problem - solving . Research has been conducted to find design process models for the engineering design problem - solving ( Atman et al . 2007 ; Hill 1998 ; Jin and Chusilp 2006 ) , and there has been long debate upon design processes . In the late 1950s to the early 1980s , many research - ers attempted to define design process models in terms of the design science approach which viewed design problems are logical , systematic , and rational ( Bousbaci 2008 ) . Simon ( 1973 ) , for example , insisted that all design problems can be well - defined because he believed that designers were capable of solving problems by transforming an ill - defined problem into a stable and well - organized system . The underlying assumption of Simon’s argument was that a skilled designer can fully identify the structure of the given problem even if the design problem is poorly structured . Therefore , many models of design pro - cess were illustrated in descriptive or prescriptive approach to identify the best practice of design processes ( Cross 2008 ) . However , the design science approach did not provide a rich explanation of the actual engineering design processes , which often feature com - plex , muddy , and murky characteristics . Moreover , Dorst ( 2006 ) argued about the issue of design process in terms of the designer , stating “the course of the problem - solving process and the very structure of the ill - structured problem are determined by the possibilities for action that the problem solver considers” ( p . 8 ) . In the discussion of the design problem , Dorst highlighted the role of the problem solver , who uses his or her unique way of prob - lem - solving . These styles vary based on prior knowledge , experience , and problem - solving preferences . Despite the acknowledged importance of design in engineering , a few evidence - based studies have focused on the process of engineering design . Atman and Bursic ( 1998 ) con - ducted a verbal protocol study to assess engineering students’ design processes in perform - ing an open - ended design task . Their study showed that the verbal protocol analysis can successfully identify processes of engineering design , which can be used to detect good or poor processes of engineering students by comparing the quality of the final design . Mos - borg et al . ( 2005 ) studied whether the block diagram design processes shown in engineer - ing textbooks are relevant to the practice of engineering practitioners . The study showed that only a few engineering practitioners agreed the design process model from an engi - neering textbook and provided alternative types of diagrams varied by their expertise and types of engineering tasks . Mosborg et al . concluded that there is no single correct proce - dural pathway that designers must follow step by step in a serial manner . Jin and Chusilp ( 2006 ) also studied how designers follow iterative processes in various engineering condi - tions . They stated that design is an iterative process of human cognition operated within the designers’ mind . Jin and Chusilp’s study confirmed that design activities involve pro - cedural patterns of cognitive repetition that vary by problem type and constraints . Further - more , Lawson ( 1979 ) conducted a comparative experiment to investigate the differences in the design behaviors of scientists and designers . The results of the experiment suggested that designers tended to use solution - focused approaches , while scientists emphasized problem - focused approaches . As shown in the prior research studies , the process of design varies according to the types of problems and the designer’s level of expertise . These 285 Identifying design process patterns : a sequential analysis… 1 3 findings reaffirm the NGSS framework ( NRC 2012 ) comparison of science practices and engineering practices that feature scientists seeking to discover and understand phenom - enon and engineers seeking to create solutions to problems ( NRC 2012 ; Kolodner 2002 ) . Crismond and Adams ( 2012 ) also argued whether strategic models of the design process are effective . The argument concluded that beginning designers tend to treat design as an end product or stage , while informed designers view design activities as a managed , itera - tive process . When teaching and practicing engineering design , people use various design process models . These models were developed through a certain depth of abstraction of complex design process activities ( Hubka 1982 ) . Each design process model has unique features , including its history , paradigm , design genre , and philosophy . However , a common driver of developing design process models is the behavioral pattern of design activity ( Clark - son and Eckert 2004 ) . Therefore , this study explored the iterative procedural patterns of design thinking in young science students’ engineering design problem - solving . Identify - ing iterative patterns of design thinking will provide a fundamental understanding of how people solve design problems . As STEM educators seek to employ engineering design as an approach to improve STEM learning , specifically science learning ( NGSS Lead States 2013 ) , it is extremely important to understand how young learners navigate through the design process and patterns in thinking that are displayed . To investigate the design think - ing patterns , the researchers proposed two research questions : Research Questions : 1 . Which cognitive activities did fourth grade elementary students display when solv - ing an engineering design task ? 2 . What are the common problem - solving patterns of fourth grade elementary science students’ engineering design problem - solving ? Design nature and design process models The process of design thinking is surely not deterministic . In a long argument on the design problem , Simon ( 1973 ) argued that designers have difficulties with defining prob - lems because of the designers’ limited abilities . An underlying assumption of Simon’s idea was that any design problem can be proposed with a well - defined criteria and constraints through a mechanical process . In other words , he believed that an experienced or well - trained designer could transform an ill - defined problem into a well - defined problem . How - ever , Dorst ( 2006 ) suggested an alternative explanation for the design problem issue with three key arguments : 1 . The “design problem” is not knowable at any specific point in the design process . 2 . The “design problem” is hard to identify because it evolves in the design process . 3 . The connotations of the very concepts that are used to describe a “design problem” are shifting as a part of the design effort ( p . 16 ) . In fact , the deterministic nature of a design problem is closely related to the nature of design . Koen ( 2003 ) addressed four characteristics of engineering problems : change , best , 286 E . Sung , T . R . Kelley 1 3 resources , and uncertainty . In terms of the change feature , Koen highlighted the fact that engineering problems never remain invariably , but rather are continually changed by various design activities as well as the surrounding conditions of the problem . Koen noted “Engineers cause change” ( p . 11 ) . Bucciarelli ( 2003 ) also noted that design is dynamic : “Designing , like language , is a social process” ( p . 9 ) . Bucciarelli referenced different design process models and noted that traditional design process models are described as an optimizing algorithm , where a designer inputs X into a model and receives Y as an output . However , Bucciarelli pointed that these design process models overlook two important aspects of design : its social nature and the people who are engaged in the design . Indeed , designers autonomously under - take the whole design process ; therefore , the design processes inevitably vary by problem - solving style , problem type , and designer expertise . Patterns rather than design process models In the publication , Design Expertise , Lawson and Dorst ( 2009 ) introduced multiple views of design , and one approach is design as problem - solving . They pointed out that most design process models used for design education are based on a view of design as a problem - solving process . In fact , most design process models have similar problem - solving phases , such as identifying problems , analyzing data , generating ideas , creating a solution , and testing . It is the true that these design process models provide novice designers with a straightforward guide to defining clear , stable , and comparable design ideas . Lawson and Dorst , however , warned of the danger of oversimplifying the complex structure of design processes , which leads design - ers to be incapable of handling the murky aspects of design problems . A promising strategy to overcome the nebulous nature of the design process is to adopt patterns of design activity instead of the procedural approach ( Clarkson and Eckert 2004 ) . Clarkson and Eckert stated , “similarities ( of various design process models ) can be recog - nized as patterns of designing , describing elements of process behavior” ( p . 18 ) . The underly - ing assumption of the design pattern strategy is that design behaviors necessarily consist of numerous sets of repeated behaviors . In general , the term pattern represents a group of com - mon elements of discernible observations in a predictable manner . For example , for a small engineering problem , a problem solver might begin with the specific problematic issues . In a large entrepreneurial project , the problem solver might start by searching market and customer needs or reviewing prior product feedbacks . Admittedly , the pattern approach requires enough data sources to detect repeatable common design process behaviors . Patterns are widely used in various fields of science , mathematics , arts , and engineering . For instance , computer science often uses patterns to find sustainable solutions for software design . In visual art , designers use shapes and patterns in painting , drawing , ceramic tiling , or textiles to create the form of the artwork . Likewise , patterns in the study of engineering and technology education inform the engineering design process itself . Consequently , patterns of design process can help students to cope with the complex nature of design problems by con - ceptualizing successful pathways to problem - solving . 287 Identifying design process patterns : a sequential analysis… 1 3 Methods Context of the study This study was conducted in the context of a National Science Foundation funded Math Science Targeted Partnership ( MSP ) project entitled Science Learning through Engineer - ing Design ( SLED , https : / / steme dhub . org / ) of project website . The SLED team partnered with four school corporations located in the north - central Midwest . The overarching goal of the project was to improve the efficiency of science learning in grades 3 – 6 elemen - tary students through an engineering - design approach . The SLED researchers primarily adopted an engineering design approach ( Lewis 2006 ) and design - based science learning pedagogy ( Fortus et al . 2004 ) to scientific inquiry ( National Research Council 2012 ) . The SLED team purposely integrated engineering and other STEM - related content to provide students with a strong understanding of the STEM pipeline . The SLED project team devel - oped engineering design lessons aligned to Indiana Academic Science Standards ( IDOE 2010 ) . The lessons were delivered during a two - week teacher professional development , and then the participant teachers implemented the SLED lessons in their classroom . When delivering the lesson to the teachers , the project team asked them to use guiding questions for each design stage rather than sharing the SLED design process model with their stu - dents ( see Fig . 1 ) . The researchers used a design task , titled Doggie Door Alarm , to capture the partic - ipants’ problem - solving behavior . The SLED research team developed the design task collaboratively based on Cross ( 2004 ) . The approach included a goal , constraints , and design criteria to gauge the final design solution . As shown in Fig . 2 , the design task was developed to measure the transfer of knowledge acquired from the SLED lesson ; therefore , the design task applied the same science and engineering concepts into the − What is the problem ? − What is the setting ? − Who is the user or client ? − What are the constraints ? − What are your ideas ? − What are others’ ideas ? − What materials will you need ? − What will your team measure ? − How might your scientific knowledge inform your design ? − How will your team create a prototype , model , or solution ? − Does your solution match the team’s plan ? − How will you record results from testing ? − What kinds of scientific concepts could explain your results ? − How did your model , prototype , or solution perform ? − What were your results ? − What feedback did your team receive ? − How will you use this feedback to inform your model or solution ? − What kinds of scientific concepts could explain your results ? − How will you improve your solution ? − What are the results from your retest ? − Which solution best addressed the problem ?

Kelley 1 3 SLED lesson , but with a slightly different context . The science concepts embedded in the design task were electricity , power , and open - and closed - circuits . Participants In the data collection , a group of three students collaboratively solved a design task as a team . As Welch ( 1999 ) suggested , the SLED project collected data as a team to facilitate natural design conservation when students engaged in solving design prob - lems . The researchers collected nine design sessions from nine classrooms ; 27 stu - dents participated in the data collection . To recruit the participant students , the SLED researchers asked to classroom teachers to select three students based on selection - cri - teria ( Ary et al . 2014 ) : representative of regular classroom performance and agreeable to audio – video recording . The demographics of the participants in Table 1 shows that the participants were approximately balanced in gender ratio . The ethnicity ratios were representative of the school district demographics . Fig . 2 Design Task for Think - Aloud Session ( Designed by Kelley and Kaluf 2013 ) 289 Identifying design process patterns : a sequential analysis… 1 3 Data collection To capture the cognitive thought processes used in design , the researchers adopted the con - current think - aloud ( CTA ) technique ( Atman and Bursic 1998 ; Ericsson and Simon 1993 ) . The nine CTA sessions were collected from three elementary schools during the 2015 – 2016 academic year . Once the SLED teachers completed a SLED lesson , the SLED research - ers contacted the teacher and arranged a schedule for the data collection . The CTA ses - sions were conducted in an empty classroom or hallway , which varied by school condi - tions . According to the Ericsson and Simon’s guidelines ( 1993 ) , the researchers provided the participant students with two instructions : ( 1 ) verbalize all thought processes related to design ; and ( 2 ) utilize prior knowledge acquired from the SLED lesson . In addition , before starting the CTA session , the researchers collected Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) con - sent forms that described the possible benefits and harms from participating in the research study . Then , the researchers provided the triad with the design brief , pencils , and a piece of blank paper for sketching . During the data collection , the researchers avoided intervening in the participants’ conversation as much as possible , and only guided the students to articulate their thinking . The entire CTA sessions were recorded via video / audio recorder ( Table 2 ) . Data coding The researchers analyzed the nine CTA sessions using the NVIVO software . The NVIVO software allowed the researchers to bypass the transcription process and directly segment and cod the data ( Mentzer et al . 2015 ) . To categorize the cognitive strategies that appeared in the CTA sessions , the researchers adopted Halfin’s codes ( 1973 ) . Halfin studied successful engineers , scientists , and technologists , and identified 17 commonly - used cognitive strategies . The 17 cognitive strategies were validated through a Delphi study survey of engineering and technology practitioners . Of the original 17 cognitive strategies , the researchers selected seven cognitive strategies that frequently appeared in the SLED CTA sessions . To obtain data cod - ing reliability , two coders trained to use Halfin’s code conducted the data analysis . A master coder analyzed all nine CTA sessions , and a second coded four randomly - selected sessions . The reliability test was conducted using intercoder agreement ( Creswell 2013 ) .

Sequential pattern analysis Once the CTA session coding was complete , the researchers analyzed the sequential pat - terns of iterative design processes using the GSEQ 5 . 1 software . The GSEQ software was developed by Bakeman and Quera ( 2015 ) to analyze the sequential probability of continu - ous string data . The sequential analysis technique was developed in the 1970s to analyze the sequential patterns of behavioral events ( Allison and Liker 1982 ; Bakeman and Gott - man 1986 ; Bakeman and Quera 2011 ) . Multiple studies from various research fields have adopted the sequential analysis technique to identify behavioral , psychological , or social patterns of sequential interactions ( Bakeman and Brownlee 1980 ; Blount et al . 1989 ; Gott - man et al . 1977 ; Jeong 2003 ; Justice et al . 2002 ) . In order to identify the common cognitive strategies from the coded CTA data , the researchers conducted descriptive analyses , including frequency , rate per 10 min , duration , and average . In addition , the researchers analyzed the sequential patterns of cognitive strat - egies using the two - event sequential analysis technique . The two - event sequential analysis seeks the probabilities of cognitive strategies from the coded CTA data . For example , the coded data generated a set of strings , such as “DF AN DE AN DE DF AN DE” . Then the two - event sequential analysis can be displayed through the transitional matrix shown in Table 3 . In the table , codes in the Given rows represent the first event , and the Target col - umns are the second of the two sequential events . The frequency of numbers in Table 3 is labeled as observed frequency ( OF ) . Using the observed frequency values , the GSEQ software calculates the expected frequency ( EF ) , which is the expected number of transition counts upon the observed frequency . The for - mula for the expected frequency is presented by Bakeman and Gottman ( 1986 ) : where f ( r ) = sum of the counts in the rth column , Given code ; f ( c ) = sum of the counts in the cth column , Target code ; N = sum of the total count . Using the observed and expected frequencies , the probabilities of the two - sequential event can be calculated through the formula presented in Eq . ( 2 ) . where x rc = observed frequency in the cell rth column and cth row . ( 1 ) Expected Frequency ( e rc ) = f ( r ) × f ( c ) N − f ( r ) ( 2 ) Adjusted residual ( Z - score ) = x rc − e rc √ e rc ( 1 − f ( c ) N ) ( 1 − f ( r ) N ) Table 3 An example transitional matrix Target DF AN DE Total Given DF – 2 0 2 AN 0 – 3 3 DE 1 1 – 1 Total 1 3 3 7 292 E . Sung , T . R . Kelley 1 3 In the two - event sequential analysis , the researchers pooled the nine sessions to test the statistical significance at the 0 . 05 level . Before analyzing the nine - pooled data , the researcher calculated the required sample size in terms of statistical significance . Bake - man and Gottman ( 1986 ) suggested that the transition events should be at least 30 , and the total number of events should exceed four or five times of the number of coded cells . Because the sequential transitions do not allow for two consecutive events , such as design - ing to designing ( DE → DE ) , the total number of cell size can be calculated by the formula K × ( K − 1 ) × 5 , where K is the number of the coding schemes . When using seven coding schemes , the total cell size is 7 × ( 7 − 1 ) × 5 = 210 . The researchers confirmed that the aver - age number of transitions of a CTA session is over 30 ; therefore , the nine - pooled CTA ses - sions are sufficient to generate statistical significance ( 30 × 9 = 270 ≥ 210 ) . The statistical analyses were conducted by pooling data from the nine individual ses - sions . Bakeman and Quera ( 2011 ) warned that when pooling behavioral data of the human subject , researchers should avoid generalizing the sampled behavioral patterns for subjects . With careful consideration of this human - subject research , the researchers adopted the pooled sequential analysis to illustrate a general shape of the problem - solving pathways of cognitive strategies in an engineering design task . Findings Use of cognitive strategies To investigate which cognitive strategies the participant students emphasized or overlooked in engineering design , the researchers summarized simple statistics based on the frequen - cies and durations shown in Table 4 . Due to the time variations of the nine CTA sessions , the researchers created relative frequency and duration to show the standardized duration and frequency by 10 - min segments . Relative frequency in Table 4 represents how many Table 4 Summary Statistics for Nine CTA Sessions a Relative frequency = Number of occurrences per 10 - min ( Freq × 600 / Total duration ) b Relative duration : Time duration per 10 - min ( Duration × 600 / Total duration ) E . g .

Likewise , the relative duration also denotes the relative duration for each 10 - min period ( relative duration = duration × 600 / total duration ) .

Sung , T . R . Kelley 1 3 during their design problem solving . On the other hand , Defining problem ( DF , f = 19 ) , Managing ( MA , f = 44 ) , Analyzing ( AN , f = 52 ) , and Predicting ( PR , f = 62 ) were less fre - quently utilized . The relative durations show that participants spent an average of 3 : 21 . 5 s on Designing , 3 : 09 . 0 s on Modeling , 0 : 13 . 9 s on Managing , 0 : 34 . 1 s on Questioning , and 0 : 43 . 2 s on Predicting per 10 - min period . The researchers confirmed that the participant students hugely emphasized designing and modeling cognitive strategies , and less often referenced defining , analyzing , questioning , and predicting strategies . Common patterns in the use of cognitive strategies Bakeman and Gottman ( 1986 ) suggested that in order to run sequential pattern analysis , the sum of a sequential event must have at least 30 event counts . However , the number of Defining Problem frequency counts in Table 4 does not meet the criteria for sequential analysis ( DF , f = 19 < 30 ) . Therefore , upon a careful review of the Halfin’s coding schemes , the researchers collapsed Defining Problem ( DF ) and Analyzing ( AN ) into a new category . The description of Analyzing in Halfin’s code was the process of identifying , isolating , taking apart , or breaking down the given problem . Therefore , the researchers framed the merged category as a problem - space that includes searching for the features of the prob - lem space , identifying criteria and constraints , exploring the investigated areas of problem , and framing a problematic design situation ( Cross 2004 ; Dorst and Cross 2001 ; Goel and Pirolli 1992 ; Yilmaz and Daly 2016 ) . To investigate the common cognitive patterns in participants’ design strategies , the researchers conducted a two - sequential pattern analysis using GSEQ 5 . 1 software . The researchers pooled the nine CTA sessions , which resulted in observed frequencies shown in Table 5 . The Given columns represent the first codes , and the Target columns are the later codes from the two - sequential patterns . For example , 14 frequencies across Given DE and Target MA represent that in the nine CTA sessions , the number of transitions from DE to MA occurred 14 times . To identify the significant patterns in two - event transitions , the researchers generated the expected frequencies in Table 6 using GSEQ 5 . 1 software ( see Eq . 1 ) . In addition , using Eq . ( 2 ) , the GSEQ software calculated the z - scores and probabilities for two - event sequential transitions from the nine - pooled CTA sessions .

The statisti - cal probabilities shown in Table 7 were calculated as two - sided P values . A right - tailed significance at 0 . 05 , for example , implies that the probability of the two - sequential event occurring is more than 95 % . The statistics identified the right - tailed significant patterns as Designing → Predicting ( p < 0 . 001 , z = 3 . 66 ) , Managing → Modeling ( p = 0 . 007 , z = 2 . 7 ) , Modeling → Questioning ( p < 0 . 001 , z = 4 . 98 ) , and Predicting → Designing ( p < 0 . 001 , z = 5 . 17 ) . The results show a bi - directional iteration between Designing and Predicting . The description of the Predicting strategy was “The process of prophesying or foretelling something in advance , anticipating the future on the basis of special knowledge” , which is a unique feature of engineering design that predicts the possible consequence of the ideas . This result suggests that there is no cognitive border between predicting and generating ideas ; rather , participants used the two strategies simultaneously during their design prob - lem - solving . Meanwhile , the data illustrates that Modeling , which is largely represented by sketching behaviors , led to uses of the Questioning strategy . Table 5 shows that 48 of 107 Questioning instanced directly followed after Modeling strategies . This finding confirmed that the modeling behavior is a mixture of mental and physical reactions that represent an internal idea in an external , drawn form ( Goldschmidt 1991 ; Tversky and Suwa 2009 ; van der Lugt 2005 ) . Moreover , the use of drawing , or sketching facilitates creative design inquiry by igniting designers’ cognitive linkages between the external representation and internal mental image . To visualize the right - trailed significant patterns , the researchers drew the pattern dia - grams in Fig . 4 . The diagrams illustrate that the significant pathways have higher than a 95 % statistical probability . Meanwhile , the transition diagrams in Fig . 5 show that there exist negative transitions at the 0 . 05 significance level . These negative significances imply that the transitions hap - pened less than 5 % of possibilities . As Fig . 5 illustrated , the probability of the transition from Modeling to Designing is less than 0 . 001 ( z = − 4 . 47 ) ; only 25 instances of Designing strategy ( f = 147 ) occurred after Modeling ( f = 106 ) . Likewise , the transition from Design - ing to Questioning ( p = 0 . 029 , z = − 2 . 19 ) , Predicting to Modeling ( p = 0 . 003 , z = − 3 . 02 ) , Predicting to Questioning ( p = 0 . 02 , z = − 2 . 33 ) , and Questioning to Predicting ( p = 0 . 002 , z = − 3 . 03 ) have negative significances . These negative patterns indicate that the directional pathways between the two strategies have a weak mental relationship during students’ design problem - solving process .

The interesting aspect of this pattern is that there exists a strong positive pathway in its opposite , Designing to Modeling . To further explore the Modeling to Designing pathway , the researchers sought alternative pathways from the entire transi - tional probabilities in Table 7 . The alternative pathways shown in Fig . 6 indicate that Ques - tioning , Designing and Analyzing , and Predicting strategies proxy the pattern of Modeling to Designing strategies . Problem solving pathways In order to further illustrate the problem - solving pathways of design thinking patterns , the researchers demonstrated the problem - solving pathway diagram shown in Fig . 7 . The problem - solving pathway diagram was illustrated in Table 7 using right - tailed events only ( positive z - scores ) . The statistical description of the right - tailed probabilities is that the two - sequential events with positive z - scores occurred more than 50 % . The pathway Fig . 4 Right - tailed significant patterns at the 0 . 05 level . Note n frequency of a single event ; f frequency of transition Fig . 5 Left - tailed significant patterns at the 0 . 05 level 298 E . Sung , T . R . Kelley 1 3 diagram shows that participant students often began the design activity with defining and analyzing ( f = 55 ) the given problem statement . Then , they moved to designing solution ideas ( Defining and Analyzing → Designing , f = 25 ) , modeling or sketching ideas ( Defin - ing and Analyzing → Modeling , f = 13 ) , or managing the team dialogue ( Defining and Ana - lyzing → Managing , f = 5 ) . When participants engaged in the Designing strategy ( f = 147 ) , the most frequent cognitive strategy , they frequently proceeded to the Modeling strategy ( Designing → Modeling , f = 48 ) , and Predicting ( Designing → Predicting , f = 33 ) . These pathways illustrate that participants commonly used drawing or sketching to facilitate idea generation . Moreover , the bi - directional pathway between designing and predicting shows that predicting the consequence of the design ideas and generating design ideas involve a strong mental relationship . The second most frequent strategy in the nine CTA sessions was the Questioning strat - egy ( f = 107 ) . The transitions from Questioning provide a critical implication of how and Fig . 6 Alternative transitional routes from modeling - to - designing strategy Fig . 7 A problem - solving pathway model using right - tailed probabilities of two - event sequences ( positive z - scores ) . Note The numbers on the arrow lines are the p values of the transition from one to another . For example , the line from defining and analyzing to managing with 0 . 529 implies that the possibility of the transition from defining and analyzing to managing is 47 . 19 % ( 1 − p value ) of the entire transitions from the state of defining and analyzing 299 Identifying design process patterns : a sequential analysis… 1 3 why participants maneuver strategy during the design process . After using the Question - ing strategy , participants moved to Designing ( Questioning → Designing , f = 52 ) , Modeling ( Questioning → Modeling , f = 48 ) , Defining and Analyzing ( Questioning → Defining and Analyzing , f = 14 ) , or Managing strategies ( Questioning → Managing , f = 10 ) . The itera - tions surrounding the questioning strategies confirmed the role of doubt in design thinking , which energizes and enhances the quality of creative work by leveraging designing , mod - eling , and analyzing the problems ( Locke et al . 2008 ) . In addition , as the Next Generation Science Standards emphasized scientific inquiry ( NGSS Lead States 2013 ) , these results indicate that engineering and technology educators need to emphasize design inquiry abil - ity when teaching design thinking ( Dym et al . 2005 ) . Conclusions The underlying idea of the study was to search for iterative design thinking patterns in young students’ design problem - solving . The researchers expected that the investigation of young students’ thinking patterns would provide a fundamental data point for understand - ing human cognition in terms of problem - solving . The first achievement of this study was the successful adoption of the sequential pattern analysis to detect patterns of students’ problem - solving . The sequential pattern analysis was introduced in the early 1970s to iden - tify patterns of behavioral interactions between mothers and infants ( Gottman et al . 1977 ) . The research method has been adopted in many studies to examine patterns of iterative behavior or cognitive events . The researchers confirmed that the use of sequential analysis successfully depicted the actual process of engineering design in young learners’ problem - solving . As shown in Fig . 7 , the results of two - event sequential analysis created a pathway model of cognitive strategy that illustrates the detailed iterations of design thinking . Second , the researchers confirmed that the statistical analysis identified four signifi - cant two - event sequential patterns . The problem - solving patterns found in this study may be useful for engineering and technology teachers when instructing engineering design approach to students . For example , the iterative patterns between Designing and other cog - nitive strategies confirmed that when students generate ideas , designing is a central point of the entire process , often followed by drawing , predicting , or questioning . This pattern concurs with the idea that design is an ongoing process of developing and refining ideas ( Dorst and Cross 2001 ) . In addition , the iteration between Designing and Predicting illus - trates that when young students were given an open - ended design problem , they tended to journey within the solution - space , often using the designing and predicting strategies ( t ( Designing + Predicting ) = 43 : 50 . 0 , 40 . 78 % of the total duration ) . This result informs when instructing design lessons using engineering design approach , teachers might need to teach assessment technics such as Decision Matrix with ideation strategies ( Kelley 2010 ) . Moreover , the data provides evidence that the transition from Modeling to Questioning has a significant possibility at the 0 . 05 level . This result supports Goldschmidt’s study ( 1991 ) that sketching is an important cognitive tool to externalize internal mental images . The use of the Modeling strategy has the same implications as Tversky ( 2003 ) ; sketching is a critical process of creative idea generation when designers make inferences from the seeing that objects of sketching . Finally , the results of this study can contribute to improving the efficiency of teach - ing and learning by fitting teaching style and learning style . Felder and Silverman ( 1998 ) studied the relationship between learning and teaching styles in engineering education . They found that mismatched learning and teaching styles not only leads to poor student 300 E . Sung , T . R . Kelley 1 3 performance , but also results in teacher frustration . Admittedly , like a human nature , mul - tiple pathways of cognitive strategies exist to develop a successful design solution . Moreo - ver , as Buchanan ( 1992 ) stated , a design problem has multiple solutions due to the inde - terminacy of design problems , including clients , situations , criteria , constraints , resources , and even end users . The researchers believe that the accumulation of the strategic pattern data of design pathways will not only develop our understanding of design behavior , but also support the harmonious matching of learning and teaching styles in engineering and technology education . Future works Future work will include a comparative experiment between experts and novices to identify the effective design pathways of cognitive strategies . Atman et al . ( 2007 ) investigated how expert and novice designers use design strategies differently , and that expert designers tend to emphasize defining the problem and gathering information more than novice designers . The researchers believe that the comparative study will identify effective strategic patterns of the design process as well as better inform the greater engineering education community of effective design problem - solving strategies .
