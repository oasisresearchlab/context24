Although many compo - nents of various cellular bodies are known , general principles that deﬁne body composition are lacking . We modeled cellular bodies using several engi - neered multivalent proteins and RNA . In vitro and in cells , these scaffold molecules form phase - sepa - rated liquids that concentrate low valency client pro - teins . Clients partition differently depending on the ratio of scaffolds , with a sharp switch across the phase diagram diagonal . Composition can switch rapidly through changes in scaffold concentration or valency . Natural PML NBs and P bodies show analogous partitioning behavior , suggesting how their compositions could be controlled by levels of PML SUMOylation or cellular mRNA concentration , respectively . The data suggest a conceptual frame - work for considering the composition and control thereof of cellular bodies assembled through hetero - typic multivalent interactions . INTRODUCTION Eukaryotic cells compartmentalize biological processes to achieve spatial and temporal control over biochemical reactions . Compartmentalization has long been studied in the context of membrane - bound organelles , where mechanisms of biogenesis and transport of molecules into and out of the organelle are well understood . Cells also contain numerous membrane - less organ - elles , collectively referred to as cellular bodies ( Mao et al . , 2011 ) . These structures , which include P granules , P bodies , nucleoli , and promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies ( PML NBs ) , are micron - sized assemblies of proteins and often RNA found in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm of eukaryotic cells . They appear to be functionally important , as inferred from their conservation among evolutionarily distant species ( Handwerger et al . , 2005 ) and their tendency to concentrate functionally related groups of molecules ( Mao et al . , 2011 ; Mohamad and Bode´n , 2010 ) . Ultrastructural analysis of cellular bodies suggests that they are porous structures with densities comparable to those of the nucleo - or cytoplasm ( Handwerger et al . , 2005 ) . Analysis in live cells has revealed that , macroscopically , the bodies persist for hours to days . Yet , they are highly dynamic at the molecular level , turning over their contents within seconds to minutes ( Dundr et al . , 2004 ; Weidtkamp - Peters et al . , 2008 ) . Recent work has demonstrated that bodies exhibit liquid - like properties ( Brangwynne et al . , 2009 ; Brangwynne et al . , 2011 ; Chen et al . , 2008 ; Kroschwald et al . , 2015 ; Patel et al . , 2015 ; Wang et al . , 2014 ) . These and other behaviors suggest that cellular bodies are condensed phases that form through liquid - liquid phase separation of the nucleo - or cytoplasm ( Hyman et al . , 2014 ) . Cellular bodies are often enriched in multivalent molecules ( Li et al . , 2012 ) —proteins that harbor multiple modular domains or stretches of low - complexity amino acid sequence with repeated interaction motifs ( Decker et al . , 2007 ; Han et al . , 2012 ; Kato et al . , 2012 ; Reijns et al . , 2008 ) or charged elements ( Elbaum - Garﬁnkle et al . , 2015 ; Nott et al . , 2015 ) ; RNA species that contain multiple protein - binding elements ; or combinations thereof . Interactions between multivalent macromolecules can drive polymerization - driven phase separation ( Banjade et al . , 2015 ; Fromm et al . , 2014 ; Li et al . , 2012 ; Mitrea et al . , 2016 ; Nott et al . , 2015 ) , resulting in the formation of a condensed , droplet phase suspended in the bulk solution phase . It has been sug - gested that this fundamental macromolecular behavior may be an important principle governing the organization of cellular bodies ( Fromm et al . , 2014 ; Li et al . , 2012 ; Mitrea et al . , 2016 ; Nott et al . , 2015 ) . Indeed , expressing engineered multivalent pro - teins or ectopically tethering high copy numbers of body compo - nents ( high local valency ) in cells is sufﬁcient to form dynamic , membrane - less puncta that resemble bona ﬁde cellular bodies ( Chung et al . , 2011 ; Kaiser et al . , 2008 ; Li et al . , 2012 ) . Cellular bodies typically contain tens to hundreds of types of molecules ( Buchan and Parker , 2009 ; Fong et al . , 2013 ) . Where characterized in detail , only asmall number of these components appear to be essential for the structural integrity of the body ( Clemson et al . , 2009 ; Hanazawa et al . , 2011 ; Ishov et al . , 1999 ) . We refer here to such molecules as scaffolds . In contrast , the remaining majority of components are dispensable for body assembly and often reside in the bodies only under certain con - ditions ( Dellaire et al . , 2006 ; Grousl et al . , 2009 ) . These mole - cules , which we refer to here as clients , often contain elements that speciﬁcally bind to elements in the scaffolds , often via low valency interacting elements of the same class as those in the scaffolds ( e . g . , Chalupnı ´kova ´ et al . , 2008 ; Lin et al . , 2006 ) . For example , P bodies assemble in part via scaffolding interactions between RNA binding proteins and RNA but also recruit several Cell 166 , 651 – 663 , July 28 , 2016 ª 2016 Elsevier Inc . 651 RNA binding proteins that are not important for P body assem - bly ( Buchan and Parker , 2009 ) . Within cellular bodies , clients diffuse much more rapidly than scaffolds ( Dundr et al . , 2004 ; Weidtkamp - Peters et al . , 2008 ) , suggesting that client - scaffold interactions are more transient than the interactions among scaffolds . Compositional regulation is a general property of many cellular bodies and may be crucial to their function . Cellular body com - positions change during the phases of the cell cycle or in response to stresses ( Dellaire et al . , 2006 ; Grousl et al . , 2009 ) . Despite their importance , the fundamental principles governing cellular body composition have been experimentally difﬁcult to elucidate , owing to the complex nature of both scaffolds and clients and the diversity of species that reside within bodies . However , simpliﬁed model systems composed of few types of molecules , each with well - deﬁned interaction elements , can help isolate key molecular parameters and thus have the poten - tial to reveal generalizable concepts . Here , we describe the biochemical and cellular behavior of three different sets of engineered molecules as simpliﬁed but representative multivalent scaffolds and low valency clients , which form model cellular bodies . Clients were differentially re - cruited into the bodies based on the relative stoichiometries of the scaffolds . Changes in client recruitment occurred sharply and on cellular timescales as the scaffold stoichiometries or va - lencies changed . Client partitioning also depended on client valency . These ﬁndings lead to a simple mass action model that predicts many features of the observed client partitioning behavior and suggests how cellular body compositions could be regulated in cells . Behaviors analogous to those of the model systems were observed in PML NBs in mammalian nuclei and P bodies in yeast cytoplasm . Thus , although natural cellular bodies are complex , their compositions may be governed by simple un - derlying rules and could be altered based on parameters that are easily tunable through cellular and evolutionary mechanisms . RESULTS Scaffold Stoichiometries Dictate Client Recruitment We began by studying three independent pairs of interacting multivalent scaffolds in vitro . These systems consisted of ( 1 ) a protein with ten repeats of human SUMO3 ( polySUMO ) and a protein with ten repeats of the SUMO Interaction Motif ( SIM ) from PIASx ( polySIM ) ; ( 2 ) a protein with four repeats of the sec - ond SH3 domain from Nck ( polySH3 ) and a protein containing four repeats of a Proline - Rich Motif ( PRM ) from Abl1 ( polyPRM ) ( Li et al . , 2012 ) ; and ( 3 ) the PTB protein ( contains four RNA recog - nition motifs [ RRMs ] ) and an RNA with ﬁve repeats of the RRM recognition element UCUCU ( polyUCUCU ) ( Li et al . , 2012 ) . Each of these pairs phase separated when mixed together , but not when individual components were alone in solution ( Li et al . , 2012 ; Figure S1A ; and data not shown ) . To model client recruitment into the bodies , we engineered a series of ﬂuorescently labeled , monovalent clients ( containing a single element that binds the scaffold ) and characterized their partitioning into droplets generated by their cognate scaffolds . We mixed ( 1 ) GFP - SUMO and RFP - SIM ( or GFP - SIM ) with polySUMO / polySIM ( Figure 1A ) ; ( 2 ) GFP - PRM and RFP - SH3 with polySH3 / polyPRM ( Figure 1B ) ; and ( 3 ) GFP - RRM and UCUCU - AlexaFluor647 ( AF647 ) with PTB / polyUCUCU ( Fig - ure 1C ) . Partition coefﬁcients ( PC s ) for the clients , deﬁned as the ratio of concentrations in the droplet to the bulk phases , ranged from (cid:1) 1 to 10 across the phase diagram ( Figures S1B and S1D ) . Client recruitment in all three systems was qualitatively similar . Clients partitioned asymmetrically about the diagonal of the phase diagram ( the line of equal scaffold stoichiometry ) or near to it ; each client was enriched only on the side where its cognate scaffold was in stoichiometric excess in the solution . For example , when polySIM was in excess ( above the diagonal ) , GFP - SUMO was enriched in the droplets ( PC (cid:1) 3 ) , but when polySUMO was in excess ( below the diagonal ) , GFP - SUMO concentrated nearly equally in both phases ( PC (cid:1) 1 ) ( Figure S1B ) . GFP - SIM showed an opposite pattern of enrichment ( PC (cid:1) 3 when polySUMO was in excess ; PC (cid:1) 1 when polySIM was in excess ) . Recruitment preference transitioned sharply , in switch - like fashion , as the diagonal was crossed . For the poly - SUMO / polySIM system , neither GFP alone nor clients mutated at their binding sites were enriched in droplets on either side of the diagonal ( Figures S1B and S1C ) . Thus , binding to the scaffold proteins is necessary and sufﬁcient for enrichment into the droplets ( PC > 1 ) . Together , these data show that , regardless of the molecular system , low valency clients partition asymmetrically into drop - lets formed by heterotypic scaffold interactions , with a sharp switch in client recruitment preference across the diagonal . Valency of Client Affects Client Recruitment Since the clients of a given cellular body can differ in their valen - cies , we examined how client valency affected partitioning . We fused to GFP 2 or 3 tandem repeats of SUMO or SIM and measured the PC for these clients across the polySUMO / polySIM phase diagram ( Figure 2 ) . Like their monovalent coun - terparts , the di - and trivalent clients partitioned into the droplets predominantly on one side of the phase diagram , transitioning sharply in their PC s across the diagonal . However , both the di - and trivalent clients had larger magnitudes of maximum partitioning than their monovalent counterparts , a feature that increased with valency : max PC was 19 and 37 for GFP - ( SUMO ) 2 and GFP - ( SUMO ) 3 , respectively , and 21 and 61 for GFP - ( SIM ) 2 and GFP - ( SIM ) 3 , respectively . In all cases , maximum partitioning occurred just past the diagonal , substantially enhancing the sharpness of the switch between client prefer - ences . The increased partitioning was likely due to higher apparent afﬁnity of the di - and tri - valent clients for the scaffold . Indeed , isothermal titration calorimetry ( ITC ) experiments veri - ﬁed that apparent afﬁnity of the clients to cognate sites increases with increasing valency ( Figure S2 and Table S1 ) . These data demonstrate that , in addition to position on the phase diagram , client valency can strongly inﬂuence client parti - tioning and thus droplet composition . Mass Action Explains Switch - like Partitioning of Low Valency Clients We sought to understand the origin of the switch - like nature of client partitioning . Our data suggest that partitioning depends strictly on SUMO - SIM interactions between clients and scaffolds 652 Cell 166 , 651 – 663 , July 28 , 2016 ( Figures S1B and S1C ) . We reasoned that client partitioning should be governed by the relative concentrations of available scaffold binding sites in droplets versus the bulk . The apparent dissociation constant for polySUMO / polySIM ( K d % 1 nM , based on ITC measurements with ( SUMO ) 5 / ( SIM ) 5 ) is much less than the scaffold concentrations in either phase ( Figure 3C ) , suggesting that most scaffold sites are occu - pied . Moreover , the apparent client - scaffold dissociation con - stants ( K d = 70 – 10 , 000 nM , estimated from ITC measurements with ( SUMO ) m + ( SIM ) m , for m = 1 , 2 or 3 ) ( Figure S2 and Table S1 ) are much weaker than the apparent polySUMO / polySIM af - ﬁnity . Thus , clients should be poor competitors of scaffold - scaf - fold interactions . This analysis suggests that , in either phase , only the scaffold that is in stoichiometric excess will have free 100 µ m Scale : 50 60 70 80 90 50 60 70 80 90 50 60 70 80 90 50 60 70 80 90 SUMO Module Concentration ( µ M ) S I M M odu l e C on ce n t r a t i on ( µ M ) GFP - SUMO RFP - SIM Merge A polySUMO + polySIM 100 µ m Scale : 200 250 300 350 400 200 250 300 350 400 PRM Module Concentration ( µ M ) S H 3 M odu l e C on ce n t r a t i on ( µ M ) GFP - PRM RFP - SH3 Merge B 200 250 300 350 400 200 250 300 350 400 polyPRM + polySH3 100 µ m Scale : 30 40 50 60 70 UCUCU Module Concentration ( µ M ) RR M M odu l e C on ce n t r a t i on ( µ M ) UCUCU - AF647 RFP - RRM Merge C polyUCUCU + PTB 20 30 40 50 60 20 30 40 50 60 20 30 40 50 60 Figure 1 .

See also Figure S1 . sites accessible to its cognate client . Conversely , the scaffold that is stoichio - metrically deﬁcient will effectively be saturated by scaffold - scaffold interac - tions and be invisible to its cognate client in either phase . The scaffold composition of the droplet and bulk phases varied in a smooth , graded fashion across the phase dia - gram , with PC s ranging from (cid:1) 30 – 125 ( Figures 3A and 3B ) . For most of the phase diagram , the PC of the two scaf - folds was similar ( within an (cid:1) 2 - fold range ) , such that the droplets were essentially concentrated counterparts of the bulk solution ( Figure 3C ) . Thus , at each point in the phase diagram , the scaffold in excess has a higher concen - tration of free sites in the droplet than in the bulk ( Figure 3D ) and consequently concentrates its cognate client into the droplets . The scaffold that is stoichiomet - rically deﬁcient has few free sites in either phase , and its cognate client remains uniformly distributed . Since the stoichio - metric relationship between the two scaffolds switches abruptly in both phases near the diagonal , the capacity of the droplets to recruit one client over the other also switches abruptly . We modeled client partitioning by mass action ( Figure 3E ) . We allowed clients to equilibrate between two simulated phases while binding to free sites at concentrations computed from our experiments ( Figure 3C , Table S1 , and Supplemental Infor - mation ) . This simple mass action model sufﬁces to recapitulate the key qualitative features of observed client partitioning ( Fig - ure 3F ) : ( 1 ) selective partitioning of clients , restricted to only one side of the diagonal ; ( 2 ) a sharp change in partitioning as the diagonal is crossed ; and ( 3 ) the dependence of partitioning on the apparent client - scaffold afﬁnity . As described in the Sup - plemental Information , the model also predicts less intuitive fea - tures of the data , including non - monotonic partitioning , as well Cell 166 , 651 – 663 , July 28 , 2016 653 as dramatically high partitioning of one client and attenuated partitioning of the other near the diagonal ( Figure 3F ; Figure 2 , trivalent clients ; Figures S3 and S4 ) . Collectively , this analysis suggests that switch - like changes in client partitioning fundamentally arise from the sharp inversion of scaffold excess across the diagonal of the phase diagram . Compositional States Interchange on Cellular Timescales Our data and analyses suggest how compositional states could be controlled by mass action . We wondered whether transitions between two compositional states were kinetically feasible on cellular timescales . We equilibrated polySUMO / polySIM drop - lets at a point on the phase diagram where only one of the clients , either GFP - SUMO or RFP - SIM , was preferentially enriched in the droplets ( but both were present in solution ) . We then abruptly changed the concentration of the scaffold components to move the system to a point across the diagonal where the recip - rocal recruitment preference was expected ( Figure 4A ) . The droplets remained intact , spherical , and of relatively consistent sizes throughout the experiment . Within (cid:1) 6 hr , all droplets expelled the initially enriched client in exchange for the other client ( Figure 4B ) . Recruitment of the latter started at the outer edges of the droplets and moved inward , and smaller droplets exchanged clients more rapidly than larger droplets . In ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) experi - ments , clients diffused much more rapidly within droplets than did scaffolds ( i . e . , for droplets (cid:1) 20 m m in diameter , RFP - SIM and polySUMO had exponential recovery constants , t , of 1 . 3 min and 38 min , respectively ; Figure S5 and Table S3 ) . Thus , scaffold rearrangements likely limit the rate of transitions between compositional states . Scaling recovery times to drop - lets of 1 m m diameter , as often observed in cells , indicates that compositions should interchange on a timescale of (cid:1) 6 s in natural systems ( Table S3 ) . We previously demonstrated how covalent modiﬁcations of scaffolds could regulate the formation and dissolution of droplet phases ( Li et al . , 2012 ) . We likewise wondered whether covalent modiﬁcations could also regulate droplet compositions . In cells , SUMO modiﬁcations are dynamically added by the SUMO ligase cascade and removed by SUMO proteases . We generated a single component , fused ( SUMO ) 9 - ( SIM ) 8 scaffold that could be selectively cleaved by Ulp1 , the yeast SUMO protease , to produce ( SUMO ) 7 - ( SIM ) 8 , mimicking natural deSUMOylation ( see Experimental Procedures ) . Such ( SUMO ) m - ( SIM ) n ( m s n ) fusions are essentially ﬁxed on one side of the phase diagram 90 80 70 60 50 50 60 70 80 90 0 15 30 45 60 75 90 80 70 60 50 50 60 70 80 90 0 15 30 45 60 75 90 80 70 60 50 50 60 70 80 90 0 15 30 45 60 75 90 80 70 60 50 50 60 70 80 90 0 15 30 45 60 75 90 80 70 60 50 50 60 70 80 90 0 15 30 45 60 75 90 80 70 60 50 50 60 70 80 90 0 15 30 45 60 75 S U M O M o d u l e C o n c e n t r a t i o n ( µ M ) S U M O M o d u l e C o n c e n t r a t i o n ( µ M ) S U M O M o d u l e C o n c e n t r a t i o n ( µ M ) S I M M odu l e C on ce n t r a t i on ( µ M ) S I M M odu l e C on ce n t r a t i on ( µ M ) S I M M odu l e C on ce n t r a t i on ( µ M ) P a r t i t i on C o e ff i c i e n t P a r t i t i on C o e ff i c i e n t P a r t i t i on C o e ff i c i e n t S U M O M o d u l e C o n c e n t r a t i o n ( µ M ) S U M O M o d u l e C o n c e n t r a t i o n ( µ M ) S U M O M o d u l e C o n c e n t r a t i o n ( µ M ) S I M M odu l e C on c e n t r a t i on ( µ M ) S I M M odu l e C on c e n t r a t i on ( µ M ) S I M M odu l e C on c e n t r a t i on ( µ M ) P a r t i t i on C o e ff i c i e n t P a r t i t i on C o e ff i c i e n t P a r t i t i on C o e ff i c i e n t GFP - ( SUMO ) 1 GFP - ( SUMO ) 2 GFP - ( SUMO ) 3 GFP - ( SIM ) 1 GFP - ( SIM ) 2 GFP - ( SIM ) 3 polySUMO + polySIM Figure 2 .

When mixed with GFP - ( SIM ) 2 and RFP - ( SUMO ) 2 , ( SUMO ) 9 - ( SIM ) 8 droplets re - cruited the former but not the latter client ( Figure 4C ) . Ulp1 cleav - age , which shifted the scaffold to the other side of the phase diagram diagonal , caused the droplets to expel GFP - ( SIM ) 2 and recruit RFP - ( SUMO ) 2 . These data suggest that enzymatic modiﬁcations of cellular body scaffolds , such as SUMOylation and deSUMOylation , could robustly regulate body composition . We conclude that droplets can transition , without compro - misingstructuralintegrity , betweensubstantiallydifferentcompo - sitional states on timescales accessible to cells . This can occur with only subtle changes in the concentration or covalent modiﬁ - cations of their polymer scaffolds .

Cell 166 , 651 – 663 , July 28 , 2016 655 Engineered Cellular Puncta Selectively Concentrate Low Valency Clients We next asked whether the partitioning behavior observed in vitro could also be observed in cells . For these experiments , we used in cis [ ( SUMO ) m - ( SIM ) n ] scaffolds , which afforded tight experimental control of the relative module concentrations inde - pendent of absolute concentrations . Both ( SUMO ) 10 - ( SIM ) 5 and ( SUMO ) 5 - ( SIM ) 10 phase separated in vitro at micromolar concentrations . ( SUMO ) 10 - ( SIM ) 5 droplets enriched GFP - SIM ( PC = 4 . 7 ) , but not GFP - SUMO ( PC = 1 . 3 ) , and ( SUMO ) 5 - ( SIM ) 10 showed the reverse ( PC = 2 . 8 for GFP - SUMO ; PC = 1 . 2 for GFP - SIM ) ( Figures 5A and 5B ) . We then individually expressed RFP - ( SUMO ) 10 - ( SIM ) 6 or RFP - ( SUMO ) 6 - ( SIM ) 10 in HeLa cells , where they each formed spher - ical , micron - sized puncta in the cytoplasm . In live cells , the puncta occasionally contacted each other and coalesced into larger structures , suggesting that they are phase - separated liq - uids ( data not shown ) . When co - transfected with individual YFP - tagged clients , RFP - ( SUMO ) 10 - ( SIM ) 6 puncta only concen - trated YFP - SIM . Reciprocally , RFP - ( SUMO ) 6 - ( SIM ) 10 puncta only concentrated YFP - SUMO . In both cases , neither YFP alone nor clients with mutations at their binding sites were enriched in cellular puncta ( Figure S6A ) . We also obtained qualitatively analogous data using co - expression of in trans polySUMO and polySIM scaffolds , along with YFP - tagged clients ( Figure S6B ) . However , experimental uncertainties in the relative concentra - tions of the scaffold components made it difﬁcult to assign cells conﬁdently to one side the diagonal . Taken together , our data suggest that mass action - based compositional control can be achieved as robustly in cells as in vitro . Scaffold Stoichiometries Control Client Recruitment into Natural Cellular Bodies We sought to determine whether natural cellular bodies could exhibit compositional control analogous to our model systems .

The PML protein appears to be the primary scaffold for these bodies ( Ishov et al . , 1999 ) . PML can self - assemble via elements within its Tripartite Motif ( TRIM ) ( Antolini et al . , 2003 ; Huang et al . , 2014 ) and also via bind - ing of its conserved SIM element to SUMOs conjugated at up to eight sites in the protein ( Nisole et al . , 2013 ; Shen et al . , 2006 ) . Though not strictly required for body assembly ( Brand et al . , 2010 ; Sahin et al . , 2014 ) , SUMO - SIM interactions likely contribute substantially to body architecture , as deletion of the SIM motif or perturbations to PML SUMOylation via mutagen - esis , viral infection , or knockdown / overexpression of SUMO ligases / proteases can cause changes in the size , number , morphology , or dynamics of PML NBs ( Best et al . , 2002 ; Hatters - ley et al . , 2011 ; He et al . , 2015 ; Mu¨ller and Dejean , 1999 ; Shen et al . , 2006 ; Weidtkamp - Peters et al . , 2008 ) . SUMO - SIM interac - tions also appear to be critical for the recruitment of many PML NB clients ( e . g . , Daxx and Sp100 ) ( Lin et al . , 2006 ; Van Damme et al . , 2010 ; Zhong et al . , 2000 ) . We initially examined partitioning of GFP - tagged SUMO / SIM clients into endogenous PML NBs in U2OS cells ( Figure S7A ) . Immunoﬂuorescence imaging using an antibody against PML re - vealed numerous PML NBs in nearly all cell nuclei . For each client , we measured the ratio of GFP ﬂuorescence intensity within the PML NBs to that in the bulk nucleoplasm ( Intensity Ra - tio , IR = Intensity PML _ NB / Intensity nucleoplasm , see Supplemental Information ) . GFP - SIM was enriched in these bodies with a me - dian IR of 2 . 9 . In contrast , as previously reported for monovalent SUMO clients ( Ayaydin and Dasso , 2004 ) , GFP - SUMO had little enrichment in the PML NBs ( median IR = 1 . 3 ) . Increasing valency increased the enrichment of the preferred client into PML NBs ( median IR = 8 . 1 for GFP - ( SIM ) 3 ) but had no effect on the impar - tial client ( median IR = 1 . 4 for GFP - ( SUMO ) 3 ) . Neither GFP alone nor a client with mutated SIM sites were enriched ( Figure S7B ) . The selective , valency - dependent partitioning into PML NBs is analogous to the behaviors of our polySUMO / polySIM model system on the polySUMO - enriched side of the phase diagram di - agonal ( i . e . , to that of ( SUMO ) 10 - ( SIM ) 5 , above the diagonal ) . Our model predicts that PML NBs on the opposite side of the phase diagram diagonal should exhibit inverted partitioning behavior with respect to SUMO versus SIM clients . To create such structures , we expressed either wild - type ( WT ) GFP - PML or a PML mutant ( GFP - PML ( SUMO ) – ) lacking some of the known SUMOylation sites in PML (cid:3) / (cid:3) mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts ( MEFs ) ( Figure 6A ) . The mutant protein is SUMOylated in cells , but to a lesser degree than the wild - type protein ( Figure S7F ) .

Like natural PML NBs , GFP - PML puncta substantially recruited RFP - ( SIM ) 3 ( median IR = 2 . 8 ) , but not RFP - ( SUMO ) 3 ( median IR = 1 . 2 ) . In reciprocal fashion , GFP - PML ( SUMO ) – puncta efﬁciently recruited RFP - ( SUMO ) 3 ( median IR = 2 . 1 ) but recruited RFP - ( SIM ) 3 poorly ( median IR = 1 . 2 ) . Neither scaffold could recruit RFP alone nor clients with mutations at the SUMO - or SIM - binding site ( Figures S7C and S7D ) . Moreover , these re - sults were independent of the SUMO paralog ( SUMO1 versus SUMO3 ) used to construct the client ( Figure S7E ) . These data suggest that decreasing the degree of PML SUMOylation can shift the bodies to a region analogous to the opposite side of the SUMO / SIM diagonal , where recruitment of SUMO - containing clients is favored . We next explored analogous compositional control in P bodies , protein - and mRNA - rich cellular bodies in the cytoplasm of eukaryotes that promote mRNA decay ( Parker , 2012 ) . P bodies assemble through multivalent interactions of RNA binding proteins composed of modular RNA binding domains and self - associating disordered regions and mRNA molecules ( Decker and Parker , 2012 ) . mRNAs that have exited translation act as important P body scaffolds ( Teixeira et al . , 2005 ) . We thus asked whether modulating the levels of mRNA , thereby affecting the relative stoichiometry of an important scaffold component , could affect recruitment of clients into P bodies . We used the lsm1 D and dcp2 D yeast strains , which are deﬁcient in mRNA decapping and therefore accumulate deadenylated mRNAs that would otherwise be targets for degradation ( Parker , 2012 ) . We then measured the IR of the P body client Xrn1 ( Jain and Parker , 2013 ) fused to GFP ( Xrn1 - GFP ) , in the WT , lsm1 D , or dcp2 D strains . Xrn1 is predicted to be recruited , at least in part , by interactions with RNA . Compared to its recruitment into P bodies in WT cells ( median IR = 1 . 88 ) , recruitment in the lsm1 D and dcp2 D strains increased (cid:1) 2 - fold ( median IR = 3 . 71 and 3 . 71 and 4 . 08 , respectively ) ( Figure 6B ) . This behavior was qualitatively consistent with the behaviors of our engineered cli - ents ( Figure 1 ) . The recruitment of the P body scaffold Edc3 ( Jain and Parker , 2013 ) also increased in the two deletion strains concomitant with the increase in deadenylated mRNAs , consis - tent with the increased partitioning of scaffolds observed in certain regimes of the phase diagram when the concentration of the cognate scaffold increased ( Figure 3B ) . Thus , these data suggest that , like PML NBs , compositional control can be achieved in P bodies by modulation of scaffold stoichiometries .

See also Figure S7 . 658 Cell 166 , 651 – 663 , July 28 , 2016 Collectively , these data indicate that the compositions of both of these natural cellular bodies can be controlled by modulation of stoichiometries of scaffold elements , analogous to the behav - iors observed in our model systems . This behavior suggests simple cellular mechanisms to rapidly and dramatically alter the composition , and thus function , of cellular bodies in response to stimuli . DISCUSSION Hierarchical Organization of Cellular Bodies We propose a hierarchical model for the composition of cellular bodies ( Figure 7 ) . The model has several key features . First , scaf - folds self - associate by multivalent heterotypic interactions and undergo assembly - driven phase separation ( Li et al . , 2012 ) , forming a condensed phase ( Figure 7A ) —i . e . , the cellular body . Second , clients partition into bodies by interacting with scaf - folds , often utilizing the same types of interacting elements as those between scaffolds ( Figure 7B ) . The typically lower valency ( and therefore lower apparent afﬁnity ) of clients minimizes their competition with the higher afﬁnity scaffold - scaffold interac - tions . As a result , clients are recruited by binding only to excess , or free , scaffold sites . Thus , their recruitment will be governed by the stoichiometric ratios of the scaffolds ( Figure 7C ) . Third , since the enrichment of excess sites switches sharply across the phase diagram diagonal from one class of sites to the other , bodies can change compositions in a switch - like manner as a function of phase diagram position . Fourth , since scaffold and client valencies can affect position on the phase diagram and the degree of client partitioning , respectively , covalent modiﬁca - tions that change valency can be used to rapidly switch between compositional states ( Figure 7D ) . We note that clients that bind regions of the scaffold that are not involved in heterotypic assembly will be recruited but remain relatively insensitive to changes in scaffold stoichiometries ( Fig - ure 7E ) . Moreover , molecules with otherwise appropriate physi - cochemical properties ( e . g . , complementary charge ) may also partition into droplets due to non - speciﬁc interactions ( Li et al . , 2012 ) . Clients containing multiple types of interaction elements , some mirroring scaffold - scaffold interactions and others not , could show complex behaviors that are essentially superposi - tions of these individual effects . This reasoning may explain the recruitment of Xrn1 - GFP into P bodies without perturbation of mRNA content ( i . e . , on what may be the non - cognate side of the phase diagram diagonal ) , as well as the enhanced recruitment when cellular mRNA is increased , as observed in Figure 6B . Complexities of Natural Cellular Bodies Although natural cellular bodies are appreciably more compli - cated than our engineered model systems , their compositions may still be understood with simple extensions to the framework we present here . First , cellular bodies may have multiple scaf - folds held together by different types of multivalent interactions . For example , RNA granules likely have multiple scaffolds with contributions from both low - complexity sequence elements , as well as RNA and RNA - binding domains . PML NBs likely assemble by a combination of TRIM and SUMO - SIM interac - tions . Multiple types of scaffolds and scaffold interactions may cooperate to synergistically promote polymerization and phase separation , as suggested previously ( Lin et al . , 2015 ) . Moreover , clients may also possess multiple classes of low valency elements that can each interact with scaffolds . Never - theless , in the absence of cooperativity , one can think of the different interaction motifs independently . For any given class , the corresponding free sites in a scaffold will dictate partitioning of clients that can bind to those sites . Indeed , perturbing one type of interaction motif within PML NBs or P bodies had strong effects on the recruitment of clients that bind to that motif ( Figure 6 ) . A A C E B D E B D Figure 7 . A Model for Compositional Con - trol of Cellular Bodies Multivalent scaffold molecules ( high valency blue and yellow molecules ) assemble and phase sepa - ratetoformthebody ( A ) . Manyclientmolecules ( low valency blue and yellow molecules , with additional domains ) areenrichedinthebodythroughbindingto free cognate sites in the scaffold that is in stoichio - metric excess ( B ) . Client modules have a hatched pattern to distinguish them from scaffold modules . Stoichiometric excess of the scaffold modules can be changed either through changes in the scaffold concentrations ( C ) or through changes in the scaffold valency ( not shown ) . Since stoichio - metricexcessofthescaffoldsindroplet ( A ) andbulk ( not shown ) changes sharply across the phase dia - gramdiagonal , thenatureoftheclientsalsoswitches sharply across the diagonal . Higher valency pro - motes stronger recruitment of the clients ( D ) . Mole - cules that bind to other regions of the scaffolds ( E , light blue trianguloids ) will be recruited indepen - dently of the scaffold stoichiometry . Natural bodies arecomposedofmorecomplicatedmolecules , with multiple types of interaction elements , but should follow this same logic . Cell 166 , 651 – 663 , July 28 , 2016 659 Second , for some systems , the distinction between scaffolds and clients may be less stark than in our engineered systems ( see also Supplemental Information ) . As client valency ap - proaches that of the scaffolds , this distinction breaks down , and the client begins to compete with scaffold - scaffold interac - tions . For such clients , the change in partitioning across the diagonal is likely to be less sharp , as we observe for scaffolds ( Figures 3A and 3B ) . Further investigations are needed to under - stand the distribution of scaffolds , clients , and such intermediate molecules in the various known natural bodies . Finally , several cellular bodies contain subcompartments ( condensed phases within the primary condensed phase ) and thus are not simple droplet / bulk systems ( Brangwynne et al . , 2011 ; Feric et al . , 2016 ; Jain et al . , 2016 ; Wang et al . , 2014 ) . Each subcompartment can have a unique composition orga - nized by a distinct set of scaffold molecules . A client may bind to free sites in any or all of the body’s subcompartments . Parti - tion coefﬁcients between any two sub - compartments or be - tween a sub - compartment and the surrounding bulk will still result from mass action driven by the corresponding free site ratios . Thus , despite the inherent complexities of natural cellular bodies , they may still be understood through the lens of our sim - ple model . Biological Mechanisms of Regulating Body Composition Biological processes could regulate the composition of cellular bodies by acting on either scaffolds or clients on time - scales ranging from physiologic to evolutionary . On the most rapid timescales ( seconds to minutes ) , covalent modiﬁcations could change valencies of the scaffold components , shifting the position of the system within the phase diagram . They could also change valencies and afﬁnities of the clients , inﬂu - encing their degree of partitioning , as suggested here ( Fig - ure 2 ) , and previously ( Han et al . , 2012 ; Kwon et al . , 2013 ) . On slower timescales ( hours to days ) , the scaffold concentra - tions could change via regulation of expression levels , or their valencies could be changed by alternative splicing . On evolu - tionary timescales , changes in gene sequences could change the afﬁnity of scaffold components for each other or for cli - ents , shifting composition and function in a more permanent sense . Some of these processes can be observed in PML NBs . For example , the SUMOylation of PML is substantially decreased during mitosis concomitant with loss of some SIM - containing clients ( Dellaire et al . , 2006 ; Everett et al . , 1999 ) , and phosphor - ylation of the SIM in PML increases its afﬁnity for SUMO ( Cappa - docia et al . , 2015 ) . Similarly , phosphorylation of the SIMs of PML NB clients , including Daxx ( Chang et al . , 2011 ) , increases their interactions with the bodies . Changes in Body Composition May Dictate Changes in Function Unlike macromolecular machines , cellular bodies continuously rearrange the bonding interactions and organization of their con - stituent parts and thus are not stereochemically deﬁned across their lengths . Their functions , therefore , cannot be controlled by allosteric transitions between conformational states , as often occurs with macromolecules . Instead , transitions between compositional states are likely to be key determinants of body function . The differential partitioning of molecules in different re - gions of the phase diagram implies that it may be most appro - priate to consider a given type of cellular body as a distribution of entities ( likely deﬁned by a limited number of scaffolds ) that lie on a continuum of compositions subject to cellular control . This idea was suggested previously for RNA - based bodies based on the related compositions of P bodies , stress granules , and RNA transport granules ( Buchan and Parker , 2009 ) . Simi - larly , in the case of PML NBs , a variety of structures in different cell types and cell states have been characterized , uniﬁed by their enrichment of the PML protein but varying in their composi - tion of other components ( Dellaire et al . , 2006 ; Luciani et al . , 2006 ) . Our data suggest that this behavior may be generally applicable to many cellular bodies . Since function is dictated by composition , this reasoning im - plies that cellular bodies may exhibit a continuum of functions , rather than a limited set of discrete functions as seen for macro - molecular machines in different conformations . Even though cellular body function may be more continuous than discrete , our data suggest that mechanisms could exist , as they do in ca - nonical macromolecular machines , to mediate sharp switches between different functional regimes . Moreover , we and others ( Molliex et al . , 2015 ; Patel et al . , 2015 ; Ramaswami et al . , 2013 ; Weber and Brangwynne , 2012 ) speculate that patholog - ical states of cellular bodies may also lie on the same compo - sitional and functional continuum . As such , manipulation or depletion of certain scaffolds may be a promising approach to mitigate the toxicities associated with these pathological gran - ules . Indeed , in models of ALS , toxicities due to TDP - 43 aggre - gation can be alleviated by removal of the Ataxin - 2 scaffold ( Elden et al . , 2010 ) . Implications for Cellular Body Function Precise control of client partitioning could mediate colocalization of reaction partners to accelerate reaction rates and increase re - action speciﬁcity . For example , polySUMOylation of cellular sub - strates was recently demonstrated to activate the ubiquitin E3 ligase RNF4 , a process that could be driven or enhanced by such compartmentalization ( Rojas - Fernandez et al . , 2014 ) . Simi - larly , metabolic ﬂux could be controlled by colocalization - medi - ated substrate channeling ( Srere , 1987 ) or the colocalization of a branch point enzyme and downstream molecules in a pathway ( Castellana et al . , 2014 ) . Compositional control may also help regulate en masse reactions such as SUMOylation of many cellular factors at PML NBs , which , analogous to DNA repair foci ( Psakhye and Jentsch , 2012 ) , colocalize not only enzymes of the SUMOylation cascade but also several SUMOylation substrates ( Van Damme et al . , 2010 ) . Partitioning into a cellular body could also serve to sequester components away from their cellular targets , as has been proposed in the regulation of Daxx ( Lallemand - Breitenbach and de The´ , 2010 ) and the priming of RNA Polymerase II prior to transcription initiation ( Kwon et al . , 2013 ) . Indeed , strong depletion of clients from bulk solution through dramatically high PC is consistent with behaviors we observe in our mass action model ( Figures 3F , S3E , and S3F and Supplemental Information ) . 660 Cell 166 , 651 – 663 , July 28 , 2016 Conclusion We demonstrate how cellular body assembly , when driven by heterotypic polymerization and concomitant phase separation , naturally leads to a simple and predictive model for composi - tional control of these structures . Our model suggests how bodies could be switched sharply between distinct composi - tional ( and thus functional ) states on a range of biological time - scales . Moreover , it suggests that superﬁcially similar cellular bodies composed of a given set of scaffolds may be markedly different in their composition and function , depending on the relative scaffold stoichiometries . Thus , a complete understand - ing of cellular bodies may require knowing relative scaffold amounts in addition to scaffold identities . Our studies thus provide a mechanistic framework for study - ing the biochemical and regulatory function of cellular bodies owing to properties not attributable to any individual molecule but rather to those intrinsic to the macroscopic structure itself . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Genes , RNA , and Plasmids polyPRM , polySH3 , PTB , and the polyUCUCU RNA were described previ - ously ( Li et al . , 2012 ) . The RNA client UCUCU - AF647 ( 5 0 - UCUCUAAAAA - 3 0 ; 3 0 - labeled with AF647 ) , as well as ( SUMO ) 5 and ( SIM ) 5 as synthetic genes , were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies . Decavalent , fused , and low valency SUMO / SIM constructs were constructed from ( SUMO ) 5 and ( SIM ) 5 by PCR . To prevent conjugation and proteolysis , we mutated the C - ter - minal di - glycine motif in all SUMO proteins ( see Supplemental Information ) . The RRM client was constructed from the ﬁrst RRM domain of PTB . The mCherry , mEGFP , mVenus , and mCerulean ( referred to as RFP , GFP , YFP , and CFP , respectively ) fusion proteins were produced by cloning into corre - sponding vectors ( Clontech ) . Sequences of molecules used in this study are listed in Table S4 . Protein Expression , Puriﬁcation , and Labeling All puriﬁed proteins were expressed and puriﬁed similarly ( see Supplemental Information ) . Proteins were expressed in E . coli strain BL21 DE3 T1R by in - duction with 1 mM IPTG . Proteins were puriﬁed with Ni - NTA Agarose Resin ( QIAGEN ) or Amylose Resin ( NEB ) , followed by ion exchange ( Source 15Q and / or Source 15S [ GE Healthcare ] ) and size exclusion chromatographies us - ingaSuperdex200orSuperdex75gelﬁltrationcolumns ( GEHealthcare ) . Pro - teinswerelabeledusing maleimide - conjugatedAlexadyes ( LifeTechnologies ) following the manufacturer’s protocol . In Vitro Partitioning Assays Scaffold molecules ( 1 % Alexa - labeled ) were mixed with GFP - or RFP - tagged or Alexa - labeled clients in wells of chambered cover glass ( GraceBiolabs ) or 384 - well plates ( Sigma ) passivated with 30 mg / mL BSA ( Sigma ) . Mixtures were incubated for 2 to 4 hr for SH3 / PRM and PTB / RNA experiments and 20 – 26 hr for SUMO / SIM experiments and imaged at 20 3 magniﬁcation . Image Acquisition and Analysis Yeast cells were imaged using DeltaVision Elite microscope at 100 3 magniﬁcation using a sCMOS camera . In all other experiments , imaging was performed using spinning disk confocal microscopes equipped with EMCCD cameras at 20 3 or 100 3 magniﬁcation for in vitro or cellular ex - periments , respectively . Images were analyzed using ImageJ or MATLAB ( Mathworks ) ( see Supplemental Information ) . Fluorescence intensities were calibrated to concentrations using standard solutions of puriﬁed client molecules or corresponding ﬂuorescent proteins , whose concentrations were independently determined . When possible , care was taken to circum - vent effects of the PSF in concentration determination ( see Supplemental Information ) . Mass Action Model for Client Partitioning Measured concentrations ( from imaging ) and afﬁnities ( from ITC , see Supple - mental Information ) of polySUMO and polySIM were used to calculate the free sites concentrations in droplet and bulk phases . An equilibrium mass action model was created to describe our systems as two compartments with un - equal concentrations of receptors ( free scaffold sites ) and a permeable ligand ( client ) . The model was numerically solved using MATLAB and predicted PC s were calculated as ratio of the total ligand concentration between the two compartments ( see Supplemental Information for details ) . Cellular Experiments For engineered polySUMO / polySIM and PML NB experiments , mammalian cells ( HeLa , U2OS , and PML (cid:3) / (cid:3) MEFs ) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 1 % Penicillin - Streptomycin , and 1 % GlutaMAX in 5 % CO 2 at 37 (cid:4) C . Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 ( Life Technologies ) and imaged 18 – 24 hr after transfection . For P body experi - ments , WT and mutant yeast strains cells carrying Xrn1 - GFP in the genome were grown to log phase at 30 (cid:4) C in yeast minimal media supplemented with a complete set of amino acids and 2 % dextrose .
