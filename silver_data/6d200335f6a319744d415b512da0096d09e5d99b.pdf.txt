To that end we evaluated 41 CZS - children , from Rio de Janeiro using Teller Acuity Cards . 12 They had Zika virus - infection confirmed by reverse transcription – polymerase chain reaction ( RT - 13 PCR ) or clinical evaluation . VA below normative values was present in 39 / 41 ( 95 % ) . In 10 cases , 14 VA was only marginally below normal ; in the remaining 29 cases , VA was more than 0 . 15 logMAR 15 below the lower limit . There was no relationship between VA and cognitive domain tasks , although 16 there was a relationship between VA and motor domain tasks . Thirty - seven children performed at 17 least one task in the cognitive set , 14 children did not perform any task in the motor set . Children 18 with VA above the lower limit performed better in the cognitive and motor tasks . We concluded that 19 ZIKV - infected children with CSZ were highly VA impaired which correlated with motor 20 performance , but not with cognitive performance . Part of the children had VA within the normal 21 limits and displayed better performance in the cognitive and motor set . Therefore , even if heavily 22 impaired , most children had some degree of visual acuity and visual function and may benefit from 23 visual rehabilitation . 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 All rights reserved .

In Brazil , where the pandemic had a high 33 impact , a great number of cases of microcephaly were reported in 2015 - 2016 5 . There was a clear 34 asymmetry in regional occurrence of CZS , which was more frequent in the Northeast region of 35 Brazil , and also in Rio de Janeiro and Cuiabá . A causal link between the ZIKV infection and the 36 occurrence of microcephaly was inferred by temporal correlation and was later experimentally 37 confirmed 1 , 6 , 7 . CZS , is not restricted to microcephaly and has a myriad of manifestations , due , chiefly 38 to neurological impairment and massive intracranial volume loss 1 . Features of the CZS spectrum 39 include partially collapsed cranium , neurological effects such as thin cerebral cortices , seizures , 40 polymicrogyria and subcortical calcifications , increase in cerebral fluid spaces ( ventriculomegaly ) , 41 hypoplasia or loss of the corpus callosum , decreased myelination , cerebellar hypoplasia and 42 brainstem and basal ganglia calcifications , along with somatic abnormalities such as hypertonia , 43 limb contracture , arthrogryposis ( joint stiffening ) , altered craniofacial proportions , spasms , 44 irritability , problems in swallowing and hearing losses 1 , 3 , 4 . 45 CZS also affects the visual system . Clinical manifestations include chorioretinal atrophy , 46 macular pigmentary mottling , vascular changes , retinal focal spots , optic nerve anomalies , 47 microphthalmia , iris coloboma , cataracts and intraocular calcifications 1 , 2 , 8 – 10 . Infection of central 48 nervous system might incur in eye motility issues such as strabismus , nystagmus and 49 accommodative capacity impairment as well 11 . 50 Even though some studies focusing on visual and ocular alterations due to ZIKV - infection 51 have examined the impact of these vision threatening events since the beginning of the recent ZIKV 52 epidemics 2 , 8 , 10 , 12 – 18 , the full scope of CZS effects on the visual system is not completely characterized 53 yet . In a cohort in the Northeast of Brazil , where the highest rate of children born with CZS during 54 the 2015 - 2016 ZIKV epidemy was seen .

The authors found VA losses in all 58 11 tested children , with acuity values ranging from 0 . 5 - 5 octaves below lower limits . Ventura et al . 12 , 59 found VA deficits in approximately 85 % of a larger sample ( N = 119 ) . Those studies were carried out 60 with populations from North - Eastern Brazil . 61 The impact of CZS on VA was also assessed , by our team , in a cohort from South - Eastern 62 Brazil ( Jundiaí , São Paulo ) , a region that presented a different epidemiological profile : although 63 ZIKV infection rates in the general population were high , the incidence of CZS was relatively low 19 . 64 Baran et . al 17 found that babies exposed to maternal ZIKV infection during pregnancy that had not 65 become infected had VA within normal limits . Conversely , in the group of babies that acquired 66 infection during gestation , 5 / 24 children ( 21 % ) had VA impairment , 2 of which with microcephaly . 67 Moreover , examined as group , the infected children showed a slower VA development rate compared 68 with the control and exposed groups 17 , 18 . 69 Visual deficits were also observed in a sample from the state of Rio de Janeiro 10 , 14 , 15 , the 70 region with the highest incidence of CZS outside North - Eastern Brazil 19 . In this sample , 30 % of the 71 patients ( N = 173 ) did not meet the requirements of a visual screening test that assessed the child’s 72 capacity to fixate a single monochromatic pattern and follow it with the gaze ( The Fix - and - Follow 73 test ) . This exam , while useful for identifying children with severe VA deficits , does not yield a 74 threshold estimate , required for a direct comparison with previous studies . Moreover , since the 75 pattern used in the test has low spatial frequency , mild VA losses might go undetected . 76 In the present study , we measured VA in infants and children who had been exposed to ZIKV 77 during gestation and developed CZS . Our aim was to better characterize the incidence and magnitude 78 of vision loss in CZS patients by assessing VA - a quantitative and universally measured indicator of 79 visual function . VA was assessed behaviorally using a clinical version of Teller Acuity Card 80 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

The TAC procedure is well - established as an efficient and reliable instrument to measure 81 VA in young children in a clinical setting 21 – 24 . 82 Here we add to our previous works 17 , 18 and to the literature of the area by evaluating patients 83 that were at an older age ( previous studies had patients ranging from 4 - 13 months of age 2 , 11 , 12 , while 84 patients in the present study had a median age of 24 months ) ; more severely affected by CZS ; by 85 characterizing VA function in affected children from a different geographic region not covered by 86 previous work , with different epidemiological profile and enrolled in a cohort which followed a 87 different study design . 88 By examining a population from another region , selected with a different selection criteria , in 89 a cohort of older , more impaired children , we further characterize the spread of the virus in Brazil , 90 continuing to help document the diversity of the ZIKV’s impact in different regions of the country . 91 These differences may be due to a variety of factors , such as strain differences , host susceptibility 26 , 92 water contamination 27 , or malnutrition 28 . Additionally , it is critical to document and characterize the 93 visual function alterations in CZS children with and without microcephaly . 94 95 2 Materials and Methods 96 This research is in line with the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki 29 and was approved by 97 the Ethics Committee for Human Research of the University of São Paulo’s Institute of Psychology 98 ( number 67031216 . 0 . 0000 . 5561 ) and by the Ethics Committee for Human Research of the Institute 99 Fernandes Figueira ( IFF ) – Fiocruz ( number 526756616000005269 ) . An informed consent was 100 signed by the parent or accompanying adult of the child after being given an explanation on the 101 nature and purpose of the study . 102 Children examined were part of the Vertical Exposure to Zika Virus and Its Consequences for Child 103 Neurodevelopment cohort , registered under NCT03255369 at the NIH Clinical Trials Database 14 , 15 , 30 . 104 All rights reserved .

For the present study we 108 recruited children born from mothers with suspected ZIKV - infection during pregnancy ( such as rash , 109 arthralgia , myalgia and fever ) and who filled one or more of the following criteria : ( a ) Positive RT - 110 PCR sample for ZIKV , from either pregnant mother or from the child within 10 days after birth ; ( b ) 111 Presence of structural congenital alterations detected via ultrasound ; ( c ) Clinical manifestations 112 typical of CZS ( such as microcephaly and eye alterations ) detected via clinical examination after 113 birth . The RT - qPCR , serologic test and clinical examination ( including fundoscopic evaluation ) for 114 ZIKV infection was performed by IFF Fiocruz research team 14 , 15 , 30 . 115 The TAC test consists of 15 gray 25 . 5 x 55 . 5 cm cards ( 35 % reflectance ) . Each card has a 116 small peephole ( 4 mm in diameter ) in the center to allow the experimenter to observe the child ' s 117 looking behavior . Each TAC card contains a 12 x 12 cm square - wave grating ( black and white 118 stripes , at approximately 95 % contrast ) on one side of the central peephole . Gratings range from 0 . 32 119 cycles / cm to 38 . 0 cycles / cm in approximately half - octave steps . The space - averaged luminance of 120 each grating is equal to the card ' s gray background . 121 Patients sat in an adult ' s lap facing an Observer holding the card . The cards were presented by 122 the Observer to the child from a distance of 38 cm . All children were examined at the distance of the 123 38 cm , despite their age because of the attentional , neurological and eye motility issues ( such as 124 nystagmus ) of the children evaluated in this study . At the start of each acuity measurement , the 125 Observer was always blind to the left - right location of the grating on the card . The Observer attracted 126 the child´s attention to the card and watched the direction of her gaze through the peephole . The 127 Observer ' s task on each trial was to make a forced - choice guess about the location of the grating 128 All rights reserved . No reuse allowed without permission .

An Assistant , behind the child , who 129 could see the grating’s location , recorded the Observer ' s guess on each trial and gave him feedback . 130 A 1 - Down , 1 - Up staircase procedure was used during testing . First the card with the 0 . 23 131 cy / cm spatial frequency stymulus ( first card in the set ) was presented to account for the possibility 132 that children with very low acuity could be in the sample . A card with half - octave higher spatial 133 frequency was selected every time the Observer made a correct guess about the grating position , and 134 a card with a half - octave lower spatial frequency every time the Observer made an incorrect guess . 135 The staircase was completed after a minimum of three reversals depending on the experimenter ' s 136 confidence about his judgment of the children’s responses . VA threshold was calculated as the 137 geometric mean of the spatial frequencies of the gratings in the final 3 reversals . 138 VA thresholds were converted to logMAR based on the distance of 38 cm common across all 139 participants . If participants had a prescription for refractive correction , and used well adapted 140 spectacles , they performed the test wearing them . Children born prematurely had their age corrected 141 ( from post - natal to post - term ) , and their VA was compared to post - term age norms assuming that no 142 differences in VA between terms and preterm 31 – 35 . 143 Children were subjected to two sets of brief tasks of functional vision assessment , fifteen 144 items related to the visual function of the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development , Third 145 Edition ( Bayley - III , 2006 ) were selected , nine in the cognitive set and six in the motor set , in the 146 same occasion as their VA was being tested , with the aim of examining if there was any relationship 147 with the measured VA . A complete application of the developmental outcomes for the patients in the 148 cohort ( at a younger age ) has been published previously 36 . 149 VA values were compared with normative values established by Salomão & Ventura 22 , using 150 the same tolerance intervals . The patients were categorized accordingly to their visual acuity falling 151 above , marginally below and below normative values . Effects of both the patient’s age and the 152 presence of any kind of retinal damage in VA was investigated by estimating the coefficients of a 153 All rights reserved .

Confidence intervals for the coefficients and the Likelihood Ratio ( LR ) 154 Statistic 37 were calculated . The relationship between acuity and functional visual outcomes was 155 evaluated via a logistic regression statistical model . We established the criteria of having successfully 156 completed at least 2 / 3 of the investigated visual acuity tasks as the binary outcome for the model 157 which was related to the VA value ( in logMAR ) as the independent variable . Any associations were 158 considered significant if the calculated LR statistic value was above the 0 . 05 significance level . The 159 statistical routines from the statsmodels library 38 were used for all statistical procedures . 160 161 3 Results 162 We evaluated 45 children , from which 41 met our inclusion criteria ( 20 boys ) . The age range 163 was 21 - 34 months . Diagnostic of CZS based on a positive RT - PCR test result from either the mother 164 and / or the child was available in 18 cases . For the remaining 23 cases , diagnosis was based on the 165 pregnant mother having ZIKV symptoms and the child presenting CZS outcomes , such as 166 microcephaly . Within the group of children clinically diagnosed with ZIKV - infection but without 167 positive laboratory confirmation , either the child or the mother had negative results in 14 cases at the 168 time of testing ( which does not rule out viremia at an earlier stage relative to the testing occasion ) , 169 while 9 cases were untested . There were 26 co - occurrences of microcephaly and retinal damage , and 170 a single case of ZIKV - infected child with eye retinal damage in the absence of microcephaly . In all 171 cases included based on clinical criteria , the mothers tested negative for the exposure to TORCH 172 agents . 173 The patients in the sample had a mean visual acuity of 1 . 0 logMAR ( SD = 0 . 3 logMAR ; 174 Range = 1 . 73 to 0 . 5 logMAR ) . Most children ( 39 / 41 – 95 % ) had VA below normative values for their 175 age . In 10 cases , VA was only marginally below normative values ( visual acuity within 0 . 15 176 logMAR from the lower normative limit , equivalent to a single spatial frequency step in the card set ) ; 177 All rights reserved .

Among the ten children with VA only marginally below normative 182 values , seven ( 70 % ) presented retinal damage . In the group of children with VA more than 0 . 15 183 logMAR below inferior limits , 21 ( 72 % ) presented retinal damage .

Since all children were tested 194 binocularly , the absence of a relationship between eye damage and acuity could be due to 195 compensation by an unaffected eye . 196 Functional vision examination results are summarized in Table 2 . Overall , most patients were 197 able to complete simpler tasks ( pay attention to object and react to the examiner’s face occlusion ) but 198 only a few completed more complex tasks ( persistent reaching , preference for novel object ) . 199 Table 2 - Functional vision evaluation . 200 201 Task Domain Task N patients Proportion Cognitive domain Item 3 – Pays attention to object ( 3s ) 32 78 . 04 % Item 8 – Pays attention to object ( 5s ) 32 78 . 04 % Item 9 – Reacts to face occlusion 35 85 . 36 % Item 11 – Shows visual preference 28 68 . 29 % Item 12 – Habituates to object 18 43 . 90 % Item 13 – Prefers new object 9 21 . 95 % All rights reserved .

Moreover , it is interesting to notice that only four children did not complete at least one task 208 in both sets of tasks ( cognitive or motor ) , all of them part of the most damaged group ( below 209 normative values ) . Most children ( 37 ) performed at least one task in the cognitive set , but 14 children 210 did not perform even one task in the motor set . These results may imply that visual deficits in these 211 children are impairing their motor skills even when their cognitive skills somewhat preserved . 212 Furthermore , the children above the lower VA limit per age had a better mean performance in the 213 cognitive ( 67 % ) and motor ( 66 % ) set than children whose VA fell below lower normative limits . 214 Those that were marginally below the VA lower limit had showed 49 % and 38 % mean performance 215 in the cognitive and motor set , respectively , while those with VA below the lower limit had 48 % and 216 44 % mean performance in the cognitive and motor set , respectively . 217 218 219 4 Discussion 220 The present study furthers our research team’ efforts to characterize the VA and VA 221 development losses in children exposed to ZIKV infection during pregnancy as we did in previous 222 studies 17 , 18 , examining a cohort from Jundiaí , São Paulo , Brazil’s Southeast .

At the Rio de Janeiro Cohort , only one patient did not have microcephaly 228 ( but had fundoscopic damage ) . 8 / 41 children with microcephaly did not have ophthalmologic 229 anomalies and 7 / 41 children showed VA within or marginally below normative values . In other 230 words , in this cohort , all children with VA loss also had microcephaly and / or ophthalmological 231 damage , which makes harder to know if the VA losses in these children are due to neurologic 232 alterations , retinal damage or both . 233 The children sampled for the Rio de Janeiro cohort came from a larger study , showing that 234 beyond the fundoscopic alterations ( mainly damages in the retina and optic nerve ) 14 , these children 235 also had ocular motility damage 30 , which is in agreement with the high degree of VA loss we found 236 in this sample . 237 The children samples evaluated in the Rio de Janeiro Cohort and Jundiaí Cohort were close in 238 size , with respectively 40 and 23 children in each one , but their profiles are significantly different . 239 All subjects in Rio de Janeiro Cohort had microcephaly and / or ophthalmologic impairment against 240 only 16 % ( 4 / 24 ) children with microcephaly in the Jundiaí Cohort . Most children ( 84 % ) in the Rio 241 de Janeiro cohort had VA below or marginally below normal against 21 % of children with subnormal 242 VA in the Jundiaí Cohort . The results in our samples seem to be representative of the cohorts as a 243 whole , given that in the Jundiaí Cohort , from 695 pregnant mothers initially accompanied , only 53 244 ( 7 . 6 % ) were confirmed ZIKV - infected , from which only 35 % of their liveborn children had 245 confirmed ZIKV - infection and from only 4 . 5 % had microcephaly 39 , 40 . Meanwhile , in the Rio de 246 Janeiro Cohort , from 224 infants accompanied since birth , 156 ( 70 % ) had confirmed ZIKV - 247 infection , from which 62 ( 40 % ) had microcephaly 14 , 30 , 36 .

These differences may be due to 257 differences in virus strains 41 , 42 present in the two states . They may also be due to differences of 258 immunologic resistance between the two populations , due to previous exposure to other viral agents , 259 nutritional profile or genetic differences 26 . 260 Considering that most ( 95 % ) children evaluated here were below the lower VA normative 261 values per age , it is important to note that 26 % were only marginally below that limit . This , coupled 262 with the fact that most children ( 92 % ) performed at least one task in the visual function sets , suggests 263 some of them , even though heavily visually impaired , may benefit of visual rehabilitation programs , 264 which might contribute to mitigate some of the visual damages suffered . 265 Only binocular evaluations were performed due to time constraints , which makes it difficult 266 to directly relate the VA outcomes with retinal damage , since visual losses in the affected eye in 267 monocular lesions might be compensated by the unaffected eye . Additionally measured VA varied 268 widely in the investigated sample , and attentional , neurological and eye motility issues ( such as 269 nystagmus ) may have contributed to this variability . Several precautions were taken to minimize such 270 factors ( displaying the cards vertically for children with horizontal nystagmus and testing at a 38 cm 271 distance for all children ) , but those potential extraneous influences must be considered . 272 Most children ( 87 % ) assessed in our study were older than 24 months at the time of testing . 273 No studies dedicated to CZS have reported VA measurements for this age range yet .
