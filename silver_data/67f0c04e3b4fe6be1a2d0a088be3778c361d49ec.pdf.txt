Here , we performed a systematic analysis of the TCGA ( adult 10 cancer ) and TARGET ( paediatric cancer ) databases , the results of which did not suggest that SAMHD1 11 should be regarded as a bona fide tumour suppressor . SAMHD1 mutations that interfere with SAMHD1 12 function were not associated with poor outcome , which would be expected for a tumour suppressor . 13 High SAMHD1 tumour levels were associated with increased survival in some cancer entities and 14 reduced survival in others . Moreover , the data suggested differences in the role of SAMHD1 between 15 males and females and between different races . Often , there was no significant relationship between 16 SAMHD1 levels and cancer outcome . Taken together , our results indicate that SAMHD1 may exert pro - 17 or anti - tumourigenic effects and that SAMHD1 is involved in the oncogenic process in a minority of 18 cancer cases . These findings seem to be in disaccord with a perception and narrative forming in the 19 field suggesting that SAMHD1 is a tumour suppressor . A systematic literature review confirmed that 20 most of the available scientific articles focus on a potential role of SAMHD1 as a tumour suppressor . 21 The reasons for this remain unclear but may include confirmation bias and publication bias . Our 22 findings emphasise that hypotheses , perceptions , and assumptions need to be continuously 23 challenged by using all available data and evidence . 24 25 26 27 .

SAMHD1 is indeed involved in the regulation of interferon signalling , and SAMHD1 31 mutations are associated with Aicardi - Goutieres syndrome , an autoimmune inflammatory disorder 32 characterised by a dysregulated interferon response [ Rice et al . , 2009 ; Mauney & Hollis , 2018 ; Coggins 33 et al . , 2020 ] . 34 In the meantime , SAMHD1 has been shown to exert a range of additional functions [ Mauney & Hollis , 35 2018 ; Coggins et al . , 2020 ; Chen et al . , 2021 ] . As a deoxynucleoside triphosphate hydrolase ( dNTPase ) , 36 that cleaves deoxynucleoside triphosphates ( dNTPs ) into deoxynucleosides and triphosphate , 37 SAMHD1 plays , together with enzymes that catalyse dNTP biosynthesis , an important role in the 38 maintenance of balanced cellular dNTP pools [ Mauney & Hollis , 2018 ; Coggins et al . , 2020 ; Chen et al . , 39 2021 ] . Since imbalances in cellular dNTP pools affect cell cycle regulation and DNA stability , SAMHD1 40 is also involved in the regulation of these processes [ Chen et al . , 2021 ] . 41 In addition to controlling cellular dNTP levels , SAMHD1 has been shown to maintain genome integrity 42 by a range of further mechanisms , including maintenance of telomere integrity , inhibition of LINE - 1 43 retrotransposons , facilitation of homologous recombination - mediated double - strand break repair and 44 DNA end joining , and prevention of R - loop formation at transcription - replication conflict regions 45 [ Herold et al . , 2017a ; Akimova et al . , 2021 ; Chen et al . , 2021 ; Park et al . , 2021 ] . Additionally , low 46 SAMHD1 levels have been detected in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia ( CLL ) , lung cancer , cutaneous T - 47 cell lymphoma , AML , colorectal cancer , and Hodgkin lymphoma . Moreover , loss - of - function SAMHD1 48 mutations have been described in cancer types including CLL and colorectal cancer [ Herold et al . , 49 2017a ; Mauney & Hollis , 2018 ; Coggins et al . , 2020 ; Chen et al . , 2021 ] . Due to these observations , 50 SAMHD1 is being considered as a tumour suppressor protein . 51 However , the potential role of SAMHD1 in cancer diseases is more complex . It also recognises and 52 cleaves the triphosphorylated , active forms of a range of anti - cancer nucleoside analogues . In this 53 context , SAMHD1 has been described as a clinically relevant resistance factor in acute myeloid 54 leukaemia ( AML ) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ( ALL ) against nucleoside analogues including 55 cytarabine , decitabine , and nelarabine [ Herold et al . , 2017b ; Schneider et al . , 2017 ; Knecht et al . , 2018 ; 56 Oellerich et al . , 2019 ; Rothenburger et al . , 2020 ] . 57 So far , the potential tumour suppressor activity of SAMHD1 has only been investigated in a few cancer 58 types . To establish a broader understanding of the role of SAMHD1 in cancer , we here performed a 59 systematic analysis of mutation data , gene expression data , and cancer patient survival data provided 60 by The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) [ Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network , 2008 ] and the 61 Therapeutically Applicable Research To Generate Effective Treatments ( TARGET ) 62 ( https : / / ocg . cancer . gov / programs / target ) databases . The TCGA provided data from 9 , 703 patients 63 with 33 different types of adult cancer and the TARGET database from 1 , 091 patients with seven 64 different paediatric cancer types . 65 66 .

In contrast , high 71 SAMHD1 expression was associated with favourable outcome across all patients in the paediatric 72 cancer database TARGET ( Figure 1A ) . 73 Considering the individual cancer categories in the TCGA database , high SAMHD1 expression was 74 significantly associated with increased survival in nine out 33 of cancer categories ( Figure 1B , 75 Supplementary Table 1 ) and with poor outcome in five cancer categories ( Figure 1B , Supplementary 76 Table 1 ) . This indicates that the role of SAMHD1 differs between cancer types and that it does not 77 always function as a tumour suppressor . Similarly , high SAMHD1 expression was significantly 78 correlated with longer survival in only one cancer type ( osteosarcoma ) in the TARGET database but 79 with reduced survival in two others ( acute lymphoblastic leukaemia , Wilm’s tumour ) ( Figure 1B , 80 Supplementary Table 2 ) . 81 82 TCGA ( all patients ) A TARGET ( all patients ) B TCGA TARGET .

B ) Pie charts indicating the number of cancer types for which high SAMHD1 expression was 86 associated with increased survival , reduced survival , or not significantly associated with survival based 87 on data from the TCGA and TARGET databases . Data are presented in Supplementary Table 1 and 88 Supplementary Table 2 . 89 90 Role of SAMHD1 expression in the context of sex 91 Next , we analysed the role of SAMHD1 in males and females in TCGA and TARGET . In TCGA , there 92 were no sex - specific differences with regard to the association of SAMHD1 with survival time across 93 all cancer types ( Figure 2A ) . However , some discrepancies became visible upon the comparison of the 94 role of SAMHD1 in the 27 cancer entities that occur in both females and males ( Figure 2B , 95 Supplementary Table 3 ) . When we did not consider statistical significance levels , high SAMHD1 levels 96 were associated with higher 5 - year survival rates in 13 cancer entities across all patients , in 17 cancer 97 entities in female patients , and in 14 cancer entities in male patients ( Figure 2B , Supplementary Table 98 3 ) . 99 When we only considered comparisons in which the 5 - year survival rates were significantly different 100 ( p < 0 . 05 ) between high and low SAMHD1 - expressing tumours for at least one comparison ( across all 101 patients , in females , and / or males ) , differences reached significance for only one sex in ten cancer 102 types ( Figure 2C , Supplementary Table 3 ) . Consistent findings were obtained for three cancer types 103 ( LAML , LGG , SARC , all abbreviations for cancer entities are provided in Supplementary Table 1 and the 104 legend of Figure 2 ) . 105 Although differences did not reach our cut - off value for statistical significance ( p < 0 . 05 ) , trends were 106 detected indicating opposite effects of SAMHD1 on disease outcome between the sexes in four cancer 107 entities , ( Figure 2D , Supplementary Table 3 ) . In kidney renal clear cell carcinoma ( KIRC ) , low SAMHD1 108 levels were associated with a higher 5 - year survival rate ( 68 % ) than high SAMHD1 levels ( 50 % ) in males 109 ( p = 0 . 009 ) . In contrast , high SAMHD1 levels were related to higher survival in females ( 72 % vs . 55 % ) , 110 with the p - value being close to significance ( p = 0 . 056 ) . In three other cancer types ( KIRP , PAAD , STAD ) , 111 low SAMHD1 levels were associated with higher 5 - year survival in females and with lower 5 - year 112 survival in males ( Figure 2D , Supplementary Table 3 ) . 113 .

For seven paediatric cancer types , data were 139 available for both sexes . When we did not consider statistical significance levels , higher 5 - year survival 140 rates were recorded for SAMHD1 patients with SAMHD1 high tumours across all patients , in one entity 141 in female patients , and in four entities in male patients ( Figure 3B , Supplementary Table 4 . 142 When we only considered cancer types in which the 5 - year survival rates were significantly different 143 ( p < 0 . 05 ) between high and low SAMHD1 - expressing tumours for at least one comparison ( across all 144 patients , in females , and / or males ) , differences reached significance only for females in two cancer 145 types ( Figure 3C , Supplementary Table 4 ) . Taken together , these data suggest that the role of SAMHD1 146 in cancer may differ between the sexes in some cancer types . 147 148 Figure 3 .

C ) Heatmap indicating cancer entities in which high SAMHD1 154 expression ( blue ) or low SAMHD1 expression ( yellow ) is significantly ( p < 0 . 05 ) associated with higher 155 5 - year survival rates . 156 157 Notably , the potentially different roles between SAMHD1 in female and male cancer patients do not 158 appear to be the consequence of sex - specific discrepancies in SAMHD1 expression . In TCGA , there 159 were no significant sex - specific differences in SAMHD1 expression between tumour samples and 160 matched normal tissue samples from females and males , when we excluded sex - specific cancer types 161 ( CESC , OV , PRAD , TGCT , UCEC , UCS ) and BRCA ( only 12 out of 1 , 089 tumour tissue samples from male 162 patients , only one out of 113 matched normal tissue samples from a male ) ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) . 163 SAMHD1 expression was also not significantly different in males and females in the TARGET database 164 ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) . 165 166 Role of SAMHD1 expression in the context of race 167 The vast majority of data in TCGA and TARGET are derived from white individuals , which reduces the 168 significance of the race - related data . In TCGA , high SAMHD1 expression was associated with reduced 169 overall survival in white patients ( Figure 4 ) . This reflects the findings obtained across all patients 170 ( Figure 1A ) and probably that 6 , 834 ( 82 % ) out of 8 , 319 patients , for whom race data are available , are 171 reported to be white . Apart from this , a significant difference in outcome in dependence of tumour 172 SAMHD1 levels was only detected in Native Hawaiian or other Pacific islander patients , in whom high 173 SAMHD1 was associated with improved survival ( Figure 4 ) . However , only 13 individuals fell into this 174 category . Cancer - type specific comparisons did not reveal significant differences in SAMHD1 - related 175 outcomes between racial groups ( Supplementary Figure 3 , Supplementary Table 5 ) , which may be due 176 to the low numbers of patients in most of the categories ( Figure 4 ) . SAMHD1 levels were generally 177 similar between the different race groups ( Supplementary Figure 4 ) . Only Native Hawaiian or other 178 Pacific islander patients displayed increased levels ( Supplementary Figure 4 ) . 179 .

Kaplan - Meier plots indicating survival in cancer patients of different race with tumours 191 characterised by high or low SAMHD1 expression ( as determined by best separation ) based on TARGET 192 data . P - values were determined by log - rank test . 193 194 SAMHD1 expression in tumour vs matched normal samples 195 To further investigate the potential role of SAMHD1 in cancer , we next compared SAMHD1 expression 196 data in tumour tissue and matched normal samples , which were available for 695 patients and 21 197 cancer types in TCGA . Across all patients , there was no significant difference between the SAMHD1 198 FPKM ( fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads ) values of tumour samples and 199 matched normal samples ( Wilcoxon signed - rank test p - value = 0 . 14 ) . However , when stratifying by 200 cancer type , SAMHD1 levels significantly differed ( p < 0 . 05 ) between tumour samples and matched 201 control samples in seven cancer types ( Supplementary Table 7 ) . SAMHD1 was higher in matched 202 control samples suggesting tumour suppressor activity in three cancer types ( BLCA , LUAD , LUSC ) and 203 higher in tumour samples from four cancer types ( KIRC , KIRP , LIHC , STAD ) suggesting oncogenic action 204 ( Supplementary Table 7 ) . 205 Next , we compared the results on potential tumour suppressor or oncogenic functions of SAMHD1 206 from tumour and matched normal tissues ( Supplementary Table 7 ) to those obtained from analysing 207 5 - year survival in cancer patients with SAMHD1 low or high tumours ( Figure 2 ; Supplementary Table 208 1 ) . When we did not consider statistical significance levels , SAMHD1 levels were higher in control 209 tissues suggesting tumour suppressor activity in ten cancer entities ( Figure 6A , Supplementary Table 210 7 ) . In twelve of the 21 cancer types , both SAMHD1 levels in tumour and matched normal tissues and 211 the relationship of 5 - year survival and tumour SAMHD1 levels indicated a similar role of SAMHD1 , i . e . 212 tumour suppressor ( higher SAMHD1 expression in matched normal tissue , higher 5 - year survival in 213 patients with SAMHD1 high tumours ) or oncogenic ( higher SAMHD1 expression in tumour tissues , 214 higher 5 - year survival in patients with SAMHD1 low tumours ) activity ( Figure 6A , Supplementary Table 215 7 ) . 216 In the next step , only cancer entities were considered for which at least one of the comparisons had 217 resulted in a statistically significant ( p < 0 . 05 ) difference , leaving 13 cancer types ( Figure 6B , 218 Supplementary Table 7 ) . In seven of these 13 cancer types , the anticipated role of SAMHD1 ( tumour 219 suppressor or oncogenic ) coincided between both comparisons ( Figure 6B , Supplementary Table 7 ) . 220 In only three cancer entities ( BLCA , KIRC , LUAD ) , the differences reached statistical significance for 221 both comparisons ( Figure 6C , Supplementary Table 7 ) . SAMHD1 consistently displayed oncogenic 222 activity in KIRC ( Kidney renal clear cell carcinoma ) and tumour suppressor activity in LUAD ( Lung 223 adenocarcinoma ) . In BLCA ( Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma ) , higher SAMD1 levels in matched normal 224 tissue samples suggested tumour suppressor activity , whereas higher 5 - year survival in patients with 225 SAMHD1 low tumours suggested oncogenic effects ( Figure 6C , Supplementary Table 7 ) . Hence , 226 SAMHD1 may exert oncogenic activity in KIRC and tumour suppressor activity in LUAD , but clear 227 evidence is lacking for other cancer entities . 228 .

Tumour and normal sample SAMHD1 243 expression and promoter methylation beta values were available for 18 cancer types in TCGA . 244 SAMHD1 promotor methylation significantly inversely correlated with SAMHD1 expression levels 245 across all patients , but the correlation coefficient was moderate and the relationship appears weak 246 ( Figure 7A ) . 247 When we looked at the individual cancer types , an inverse correlation between SAMHD1 expression 248 and promotor methylation was detected in 18 cancer entities ( Supplementary Table 8 ) . In eleven of 249 these cancer types , the inverse correlations displayed p - values < 0 . 05 ( Supplementary Table 8 ) . The 250 cancer types with the strongest inverse correlations between SAMHD1 expression and promotor 251 methylation were TGCT ( Testicular Germ Cell Tumours ) , THYM ( Thymoma ) , and CHOL 252 A Tumour suppressor effects Oncogenic effects B C .

There were also 15 cancer entities with a direct correlation 253 between SAMHD1 expression and promotor methylation , only four of which were associated with a 254 p - value < 0 . 05 . These data suggest that promotor methylation is one SAMHD1 regulation mechanism 255 among others and that its role differs between cancer types . 256 Eight miRNAs ( mir - 30a , mir - 155 , and six subtypes of mir - 181 ) have been described to be involved in 257 SAMHD1 regulation [ Jin et al . , 2014 ; Pilakka - Kanthikeel et al . , 2015 ; Kohnken et al . , 2017 ; Riess et al . , 258 2017 ] . Moreover , 21 miRNAs were indicated to interact with SAMHD1 in the DIANA - TarBase v8 259 [ http : / / www . microrna . gr / tarbase ] [ Karagkouni et al . , 2018 ] , an online resource that lists 260 experimentally validated miRNA / mRNA interactions . After the removal of overlaps , this resulted in a 261 list of 28 miRNAs with a documented effect on SAMHD1 ( Supplementary Table 9 ) . 262 Of these 28 miRNAs , 26 miRNAs were found to be inversely correlated with SAMHD1 expression in 263 one ( mir - 21 ) to 18 ( mir - 183 ) cancer entities ( Supplementary Table 10 ) . Six miRNAs ( mir - 23b , mir - 30a , 264 mir - 192 , mir - 181d , mir - 218 - 1 , mir - 218 - 2 ) were significantly ( p < 0 . 05 ) inversely correlated with 265 SAMHD1 across all patients , with mir - 23b showing the strongest inverse correlation ( R = - 0 . 14 , 266 p = 2 . 2x10 - 16 ) ( Figure 7B , Supplementary Table 10 ) . The strongest inverse correlation was detected 267 between mir - 30c - 1 and SAMHD1 in THYM ( R = - 0 . 85 , p = 0 . 02 ) ( Figure 7B , Supplementary Table 10 ) . 268 Each of these 28 miRNAs were found to be inversely correlated with SAMHD1 expression in between 269 two ( mir - 155 ) and all 28 ( mir - 23b and mir - 183 ) cancer entities ( Supplementary Table 10 ) . Six miRNAs 270 ( mir - 23b , mir - 30a , mir - 192 , mir - 181d , mir - 218 - 1 , mir - 218 - 2 ) were significantly ( p < 0 . 05 ) inversely 271 correlated with SAMHD1 across all patients , with mir - 23b showing the strongest inverse correlation 272 ( Figure 7B , Supplementary Table 10 ) . The strongest inverse correlation in a cancer type was detected 273 between mir - 23b and SAMHD1 in TGCT ( R = - 0 . 54 , p = 7 . 37x10 - 13 ) ( Figure 7B , Supplementary Table 10 ) . 274 Taken together , SAMHD1 levels are determined by complex regulation mechanisms that include 275 promotor methylation and miRNAs , together with post - translational modifications such as 276 phosphorylation and acetylation that have also been described [ Coggins et al . , 2020 ; Chen et al . , 277 2021 ] . 278 .

Data for all significant inverse correlations of miRNAs 287 and SAMHD1 across all cancer types are provided in Supplementary Table 10 . 288 289 SAMHD1 mutations and patient survival 290 SAMHD1 mutations have been described in cancers including chronic lymphocytic leukaemia , T - cell 291 prolymphocytic leukaemia , mantle cell lymphoma , cutaneous T - cell lymphoma and colon cancer 292 [ Clifford et al . , 2014 ; Guièze et al . , 2015 ; Merati et al . , 2015 ; Amin et al . , 2016 ; Rentoft et al . , 2016 ; 293 Burns et al . , 2018 ; Johansson et al . , 2018 ; Nadeu et al . , 2020 ; Bühler et al . , 2021 ; Roider et al . , 2021 ] . 294 Mutation data was available for 10 , 149 patients in the TCGA . 15 , 351 out of 21 , 156 genes harboured 295 at least one non - synonymous mutation in one patient ( Supplementary Table 11 ) . The three most 296 commonly mutated genes were TTN , MUC16 , and TP53 ( Supplementary Table 11 ) . TTN and MUC16 297 encode the two longest human proteins ( 36 , 800 and 14 , 500 amino acids , respectively ) that are 298 frequently found mutated . Mutations in these genes are commonly regarded not to be of functional 299 relevance and removed as artefacts or used as indicators of the mutational burden of tumours , while 300 TP53 is known to be the most commonly mutated tumour suppressor gene [ Lawrence et al . , 2013 ; 301 Kim et al . , 2017 ; Levine , 2020 ; Oh et al . , 2020 ; Wang et al . , 2020 ; Yang et al . , 2020 ] . 302 In total , SAMHD1 was mutated 201 times , including 175 non - synonymous mutations in 159 patients 303 ( 1 . 57 % of patients for whom mutation data was available ) ( Supplementary Table 11 ) . This places 304 SAMHD1 within the top 15 . 3 % of most commonly mutated genes ( Figure 8A , Supplementary Table 305 11 ) . Among the 135 patients with SAMHD1 mutant tumours for whom survival data were available , 306 SAMHD1 mutations were associated with superior outcome ( Figure 8B , Supplementary Table 12 ) . In 307 18 of the 25 cancer types , in which SAMHD1 mutations were detected , 5 - year survival was higher in 308 patients with SAMHD1 mutant tumours ( Supplementary Table 12 ) . However , the significance of these 309 data is limited due to the low number of SAMHD1 mutations . Notably , the p - value ( 0 . 07 ) was close to 310 significance in UCEC , the cancer type with the most SAMHD1 mutations ( 35 / 6 . 6 % out of 527 ) , in which 311 93 . 2 % of patients with SAMHD1 mutant cancers survived for five years , in contrast to 76 . 1 % of the 312 492 UCEC patients with SAMHD1 wild - type cancers ( Figure 8C , Supplementary Table 12 ) . 313 Although it is not possible to draw firm conclusions from these data , they do not support a general 314 tumour suppressive role of SAMHD1 , as mutations in tumour suppressor genes would rather be 315 expected to result in shorter survival . For example , mutations in TP53 , the most commonly mutated 316 tumour suppressor gene [ Levine , 2020 ] , were associated with reduced survival ( Figure 8D ) . 317 318 SAMHD1 mutations are likely to be deleterious 319 Twenty - nine of the mutations are likely to result in a loss of function , including 11 stop - gain , 11 320 frameshift , six splice site and one stop loss mutation . While 21 mutations were located in untranslated 321 regions ( six 5’ UTR , 15 3’ UTR ) , four were in introns , three in - frame , 25 were synonymous , with the 322 remaining 104 resulting in nonsynonymous mutations . 323 50 mutations had already been described in cancer cells or were present in positions that had been 324 found mutated in cancer cells ( Supplementary Table 11 ) . Three of the SAMHD1 mutations identified 325 in the TCGA ( R143C / UCEC patient , R145Q / COAD patient , R290H / STAD patient ) were loss - of - function 326 mutations associated with Aicardi - Goutiѐres syndrome [ Rice et al . , 2009 ; Mauney & Hollis , 2018 ; 327 Coggins et al . , 2020 ; UniProt Consortium , 2021 ] . 18 nonsynonymous mutations occurred at positions 328 .

This was supported by structural analysis which 330 showed that ten non - synonymous mutations were located around the SAMHD1 active ligand binding 331 sites ( Figure 8F ) . 332 Next , the SAMHD1 non - synonymous variants were analysed using SIFT [ Sim et al . , 2012 ] , PolyPhen - 2 333 [ Ng & Henikoff , 2001 ; Sim et al . , 2012 ; Vaser et al . , 2016 ] , Condel [ González - Pérez & López - Bigas , 334 2011 ] , and CADD [ Kircher et al . , 2014 ] to predict if they are likely to have an effect on protein function 335 ( Supplementary Table 11 ) . Approximately half of the amino acid changes were predicted to have a 336 significant impact on SAMHD1 function ( SIFT : 63 / 104 ( 60 . 6 % ) , Polyphen - 2 : 50 / 104 ( 48 . 1 % ) and 337 Condel : 54 / 104 ( 51 . 9 % ) ) . 72 of these variants also had a scaled CADD score of > 20 , which rates a 338 variant among the top 1 % of the most deleterious changes . Five variants displayed CADD scores > 30 339 ( Figure 8E ) . 39 variants had a SIFT rating of ‘tolerated’ , a PolyPhen - 2 rating of ‘benign’ and a Condel 340 rating of ‘neutral’ , of which 13 had a scaled CADD score of < 10 . Predictions for the remaining 17 amino 341 acid changes were inconsistent ( i . e . contrasting SIFT , PolyPhen - 2 and Condel predictions ) 342 ( Supplementary Table 11 ) . 343 Taken together , many of the mutations appear to affect SAMHD1 function . However , loss - of - function 344 should typically be associated with reduced survival in tumour suppressor genes . 345 .

Yellow dashed lines 356 indicate hydrogen bonds between mutated residues and ligand . 357 358 Literature review SAMHD1 and cancer 359 Our analysis of TCGA and TARGET data do not suggest that SAMHD1 generally functions as a tumour 360 suppressor protein . Neither SAMHD1 mutations nor low SAMHD1 levels were consistently associated 361 with reduced survival . However , SAMHD1 is discussed as a potential tumour suppressor protein in the 362 literature [ Herold et al . , 2017a ; Chen et al . , 2021 ] . Next , we performed a systematic review to compare 363 our findings to those from the literature and to gain further insights into the narrative underlying the 364 perceived role of SAMHD1 in cancer . 365 The literature search was performed in PubMed ( https : / / pubmed . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov ) on 17 th June 2021 366 using the search term " ( ( ( Cancer ) OR ( tumor ) OR ( tumour ) ) ) AND ( SAMHD1 ) " . It resulted in 150 hits , 367 including 35 articles with relevant original data and 15 relevant secondary literature articles ( reviews , 368 editorials , comments ) ( Supplementary Figure 7 , Supplementary Table 13 ) . 369 The first articles reported on a potential role of SAMHD1 in cancer in 2013 [ Clifford et al . , 2014 ; de 370 Silva et al . , 2014 ; Shi et al . , 2014 ] . The first one reported on low SAMHD1 levels in patients with Sézary 371 syndrome , an aggressive subtype of cutaneous T - cell lymphoma , due to SAMHD1 methylation [ de Silva 372 et al . , 2014 ] , while the second paper described SAMHD1 variants associated with hepatitis B virus - and 373 hepatitis C virus - induced hepatocellular carcinoma [ Shi et al . , 2014 ] . The third paper found SAMHD1 374 mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and proposed that these mutations promote leukaemia 375 development by affecting SAMHD1 - mediated DNA repair [ Clifford et al . , 2014 ] . 376 Among the 35 articles that reported on an association between SAMHD1 and cancer , four did not 377 ( entirely ) support the ‘SAMHD1 is a tumour suppressor’ narrative [ Yang et al . , 2017 ; Kodigepalli et al . , 378 2018 ; Shang et al . , 2018 ; Xagoraris et al . , 2021 ] . One study correlated high SAMHD1 levels with 379 metastasis formation in colorectal cancer [ Yang et al . , 2017 ] . Kodigepalli et al . , [ 2018 ] reported that 380 SAMHD1 knock - out increases acute myeloid leukaemia cell proliferation via PI3K signalling but inhibits 381 tumourigenesis potentially due to a lack of SAMHD1 - mediated TNFalpha suppression . Notably , the 382 title of this study exclusively focused on the inhibitory effects of SAMHD1 on leukaemia cell 383 proliferation and did not mention its role in tumourigenesis [ Kodigepalli et al . , 2018 ] . One study 384 detected a SAMHD1 increase upon lung cancer progression [ Shang et al . , 2018 ] , and the most recent 385 study , correlated the presence of SAMHD1 in Hodgkin lymphoma cells with unfavourable outcome 386 [ Xagoraris et al . , 2021 ] . Notably , this study [ Xagoraris et al . , 2021 ] even referred to SAMHD1 as " novel 387 tumour suppressor " in the title , although the study rather indicated an oncogenic role of SAMHD1 . 388 The remaining articles largely focused on SAMHD1 mutations and reduced SAMHD1 levels in different 389 cancer types as well as on SAMHD1’s potential role as a tumour suppressor involved in DNA repair 390 ( Supplementary Table 13 ) . SAMHD1 mutations were detected in patients with hepatocellular 391 carcinoma [ Shi et al . , 2014 ] , chronic lymphocytic leukaemia [ Clifford et al . , 2014 ; Guièze et al . , 2015 ; 392 .

All four patients with SAMHD1 mutant hepatocellular carcinoma survived for five years , 400 while only 51 . 4 % of 359 patients with SAMHD1 wild - type hepatocellular carcinomas survived for five 401 years . In colorectal adenocarcinoma ( COAD ) , there was no noticeable difference between the survival 402 of patients with SAMHD1 mutant and SAMHD1 wild - type tumours ( Supplementary Table 12 ) . Only in 403 rectal adenocarcinoma ( READ ) , a trend suggested that patients with SAMHD1 mutant tumours may 404 have a worse outcome . None out of five patients with SAMHD1 mutant tumours survived for five 405 years , while 54 . 9 % of 130 patients with SAMHD1 wild - type tumours did ( Supplementary Table 12 ) . 406 Acute myeloid leukaemia ( LAML ) was the only cancer type in which a significant difference was 407 detected between patients with SAMHD1 mutant and wild - type cancer cells . Patients with SAMHD1 408 mutant leukaemia cells had a higher 5 - year survival rate ( Supplementary Table 8 ) . However , this is 409 most probably not due to general oncogenic activity , but because lack of SAMHD1 function results in 410 a higher activity of nucleoside analogues including cytarabine and decitabine that are SAMHD1 411 substrates and commonly used for LAML treatment [ Schneider et al . , 2017 ; Oellerich et al . , 2019 ] . 412 The study on colorectal cancer [ Rentoft et al . , 2016 ] was the only one that had used TCGA data . 413 However , it only used TCGA data to identify mutations , but did not compare survival in patients with 414 and without SAMHD1 mutations . 415 SAMHD1 expression levels have been suggested to impact on cutaneous T - cell lymphoma [ de Silva et 416 al . , 2014 ] , lung cancer [ Wang et al . , 2014 ; Shang et al . , 2018 ] , colorectal cancer [ Yang et al . , 2017 ] , and 417 acute myeloid leukaemia [ Jiang et al . , 2020 ] . Low SAMHD1 levels were described in cutaneous T - cell 418 lymphoma and acute myeloid leukaemia cells [ de Silva et al . , 2014 ; Jiang et al . , 2020 ] , supporting a 419 potential role as a tumour suppressor . TCGA did not contain data on SAMHD1 expression in cutaneous 420 T - cell lymphoma or acute myeloid leukaemia cells relative to control cells . 421 In lung cancer , conflicting results were reported . One study found that SAMHD1 is down regulated in 422 lung cancer by methylation and inhibits tumour cell proliferation [ Wang et al . , 2014 ] . The other study 423 reported that SAMHD1 levels increase in the serum of lung cancer patients upon progression [ Shang 424 et al . , 2018 ] . Our analysis of SAMHD1 data found significantly higher 5 - year survival rates in patients 425 with tumours displaying high SAMHD1 expression levels ( Supplementary Table 1 ) supporting the first 426 study . Notably , elevated SAMHD1 in the serum of lung cancer patients may not have been derived 427 from cancer tissue . 428 In colorectal cancer , low SAMHD1 levels were detected in tumour tissues relative to adjacent control 429 tissues [ Yang et al . , 2017 ] , which agrees with a tumour suppressor function . However , higher SAMHD1 430 levels were associated with metastasis formation [ Yang et al . , 2017 ] , rather supporting an oncogenic 431 role . The study included the analysis of TCGA data on colorectal cancer [ Yang et al . , 2017 ] , but no 432 systematic analysis of SAMHD1 across different cancer entities . 433 The 15 relevant secondary literature articles all had narratives focussing on the potential role of 434 SAMHD1 as a tumour suppressor ( Supplementary Table 13 ) . 435 436 .

It is The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted July 5 , 2021 . ; https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 2021 . 07 . 03 . 451003 doi : bioRxiv preprint 20 Discussion 437 SAMHD1 has been suggested to exert tumour suppressor functions due its role in maintaining genome 438 integrity and as an inhibitor of uncontrolled proliferation [ Herold et al . , 2017 ; Chen et al . , 2021 ] . 439 However , our analysis of TCGA and TARGET data does not suggest that SAMHD1 should be regarded 440 as a bona fide tumour suppressor . Notably , SAMHD1 mutations that interfere with SAMHD1 function 441 were not associated with poor outcome , which is something that would be expected from a tumour 442 suppressor . In agreement , no increased cancer formation has been described in SAMHD1 - deficient 443 animal models [ Kohnken et al . , 2015 ] . 444 Our results rather indicated that changes in SAMHD1 are involved in the oncogenic process in a 445 minority of cases and that it may exert pro - or antitumourigenic effects in different cancer types ( and 446 perhaps individual tumours ) . Moreover , the role of SAMHD1 may differ between the sexes and 447 different races . These findings also show that our understanding of the processes underlying cancer 448 needs to improve further , before a broad paradigm shift towards tumour - agnostic approaches [ Danesi 449 et al . , 2021 ] can become a reality . 450 Notably , the interpretation of our findings may be affected by SAMHD1 being a triphosphohydrolase 451 that cleaves and inactivates the triphosphorylated forms of a number of nucleoside analogues 452 including cytarabine , decitabine , and nelarabine [ Schneider et al . , 2017 ; Oellerich et al . , 2019 ; 453 Rothenburger et al . , 2020 ] . However , most cancer diseases are not treated with SAMHD1 substrates . 454 Notably , KIRC ( kidney renal clear cell carcinoma ) , the only cancer in which 5 - year survival is 455 significantly lower in SAMHD1 high tumours and SAMHD1 levels are significantly higher in tumour 456 than in control tissues , suggesting an oncogenic role of SAMHD1 , is not treated with nucleoside 457 analogues [ Geynisman et al . , 2021 ] . Hence , the absence of tumour suppressor activity and / or 458 oncogenic effects cannot simply be explained by SAMHD1 - mediated inactivation of nucleoside 459 analogue substrates . 460 Our findings demonstrating that SAMHD1 plays multifaceted ( and often , if any , minor ) roles in cancer 461 seem to be in disaccord with a perception and narrative forming in the field suggesting that SAMHD1 462 is a tumour suppressor [ Herold et al . , 2017 ; Chen et al . , 2021 ] . A systematic review confirmed that 463 most of the available literature focuses on a potential role of SAMHD1 as a tumour suppressor . Among 464 35 original articles on the role of SAMHD1 in cancer , 31 discussed a potential tumour suppressor 465 function and three potential oncogenic effects . One article reported both potential tumour suppressor 466 and oncogenic activity , but only mentioned the anticipated tumour suppressor effects in the title 467 [ Kodigepalli et al . , 2018 ] . All 15 secondary literature articles ( reviews , editorials , comments ) had a 468 narrative built around SAMHD1 being a candidate tumour suppressor . 469 The narrative that SAMHD1 is a tumour suppressor has formed since 2013 around findings in a limited 470 number of cancer entities ( Supplementary Table 13 ) . Three reasons may contribute to the 471 perpetuation of such a narrative without much scrutiny . Firstly , SAMHD1 has been described to 472 maintain genome integrity by a range of different mechanisms [ Herold et al . , 2017 ; Akimova et al . , 473 2021 ; Chen et al . , 2021 ; Park et al . , 2021 ] . Hence , a potential tumour suppressor role is plausible and 474 convincing . Further research will have to show why SAMHD1 ' s multifaceted roles in DNA repair do not 475 translate into a consistent and general tumour suppressor function . 476 The second potential reason is confirmation bias . Scientists ( like everybody else ) tend to accept 477 findings that support their own experiences , assumptions , and perceptions and to disregard evidence 478 that challenges them [ Letrud & Hernes , 2019 ; Yanai & Lercher , 2021 ] . Thus , researchers are more 479 likely to look for data that support their hypothesis and not for those that contradict it . Notably , one 480 .

In the case of studies investigating a potential role of 485 SAMHD1 in cancer , this means that some studies that did not find a relationship between SAMHD1 486 and cancer may simply not have been published and that the publicly available data may not reflect 487 all available data on the subject . 488 In conclusion , SAMHD1 can play multifaceted roles in cancer that may differ between different cancer 489 types , the sexes , and races . In contradiction to the predominant narrative , SAMHD1 may exert 490 oncogenic as well as tumour suppressor activity and may often be a minor ( if any ) player in 491 carcinogenesis . Our findings emphasise that hypotheses , perceptions , and assumptions need to be 492 continuously challenged by using all available data and evidence . In this context , it is important that 493 all data are actually published and made available , even if they are not deemed particularly exciting 494 by researchers . Finally , the increasing number of available data and databases should be effectively 495 used to inform and challenge our research and research findings . 496 497 498 .

Ages at 511 diagnosis ranged from six days to 32 . 41 years ( median age at diagnosis was 5 . 4 years ( 1976 days ) ) . 512 Tumour vs normal sample gene expression was compared using the wilcox . test function in R , which 513 performs the Mann Whitney U test for independent groups . Pairwise comparisons were made using 514 the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test . Pie charts were generated using ggplot2 . 515 Methylation and miRNA data 516 TCGA methylation beta values and miRNA expression values ( reads per million miRNA mapped ) were 517 downloaded from the GDC Data Portal ( https : / / portal . gdc . cancer . gov ) . Mean methylation beta values 518 for each CpG site in the SAMHD1 promoter for which data were available ( cg02078758 , cg00642209 , 519 cg16430572 , cg09128050 , cg12099051 , cg18861300 , cg11094122 , cg22769031 , cg23888977 , 520 cg09717261 , cg24951864 , cg06097592 , cg22583967 , cg10804363 and cg12517061 ) were calculated 521 per individual . Expression data for miRNAs which were listed in DIANA - TarBase v8 [ Karagkouni et al . , 522 2018 ] as being experimentally validated to positively interact with SAMHD1 ( n = 21 ) along with eight 523 miRNAs shown in previous experiments to target SAMHD1 [ Jin et al . , 2014 ; Pilakka - Kanthikeel et al . , 524 2015 ; Kohnken et al . , 2017 ; Riess et al . , 2017 ] were extracted for analysis . Scatter plots and associated 525 Pearson correlations for methylation and miRNA expression with SAMHD1 expression were calculated 526 using the ggplot2 package in R . 527 Survival analyses 528 Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate the hazard ratio for cohorts expressing high 529 levels of SAMHD1 . Overall survival ( OS ) was defined as days to last follow - up or death , as previously 530 described [ Ng et al . , 2016 ] . Calculations were performed using the R survminer and survival packages . 531 The ‘surv _ cutpoint’ function was used to identify the optimal expression cut - off point to give the 532 lowest p - value for high vs low expression . We permitted the cut - off to be only between the 20 th and 533 80 th percentiles of gene expression values , as described by previously [ Uhlen et al . , 2017 ] . 534 Kaplan - Meier survival curves were generated using R package ggsurvplot . P - values in each case were 535 the result of a log rank ( Mantel - Cox ) test , which assesses whether there is a significant difference 536 between the survival of two independent groups . Hazard ratios quoted refer to values for ‘low’ ( below 537 the calculated optimal cut - off ) expression for each gene in the model , with values > 1 indicating 538 increased hazard ( i . e . reduced OS ) and values < 1 indicating decreased hazard ( i . e . increased OS ) . 539 Mutation Data and Variant Effect Prediction 540 .

A dot plot displaying mutation frequencies of 21 , 156 genes was 542 generated using ggplot2 . 543 In order to assess the potential impact of mutations in SAMHD1 , we used the online tool Variant Effect 544 Predictor ( VEP ) [ McLaren et al . , 2016 ] to obtain reports from SIFT [ Sim et al . , 2012 ] , PolyPhen - 2 545 [ Adzhubei et al . , 2010 ] , Condel [ González - Pérez & López - Bigas , 2011 ] and CADD [ Kircher et al . , 2014 ] . 546 A lollipop plot of SAMHD1 mutations was generated using the cBioPortal MutationMapper tool 547 ( https : / / www . cbioportal . org / mutation _ mapper ) [ Cerami et al . , 2012 ] . 548 Literature review 549 Relevant articles were identified on 17 th June 2021 by using the search term " ( ( ( Cancer ) OR ( tumor ) 550 OR ( tumour ) ) ) AND ( SAMHD1 ) " in PubMed ( https : / / pubmed . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov ) on the basis of the 551 principles outlined in the PRISMA guidelines ( http : / / prisma - statement . org ) . Articles in English were 552 included into the analysis , when they contained original data on the role of SAMHD1 in cancer . 553 Moreover , reviews that discussed the potential impact of SAMHD1 on cancer were used to analyse 554 conceptions and the predominant narrative in the field . Two reviewers independently analysed 555 articles for relevant information and then agreed a list of relevant articles . 556 557 Conflict of interest 558 There is no conflict of interest . 559 .
