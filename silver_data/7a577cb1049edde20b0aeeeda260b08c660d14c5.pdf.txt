While much has been learned using this paradigm , it ignores an important component of many real - world retrieval tasks : the decision to terminate memory search . The present study examines the temporal characteristics underlying memory search by comparing within subjects a standard retrieval paradigm with a ﬁ nite , preset amount of time ( closed interval ) to a design that allows participants to terminate memory search on their own ( open interval ) . Calling on the results of several presented simulations , we anticipated that the threshold for number of retrieval failures varied as a function of the nature of the recall paradigm , such that open intervals should result in lower thresholds than closed intervals . Moreover , this effect was expected to manifest in interretrieval times ( IRTs ) . Although retrieval - interval type did not signi ﬁ cantly impact the number of items recalled or error rates , IRTs were sensitive to the manipulation . Speci ﬁ cally , the ﬁ nal IRTs in the closed - interval paradigm were longer than those of the open - interval paradigm . This pattern suggests that providing participants with a preset retrieval interval not only masks an important component of the retrieval process ( the memory search termination decision ) , but also alters temporal retrieval dynamics . Task demands may compel people to strategically control aspects of their retrieval by implementing different stopping rules .

A fundamental component of many information search tasks is the decision of when to terminate the search process . Information search can focus either on the external or on the internal environ - ment ( Hills , Todd , & Goldstone , 2008 ) . External search concerns the acquisition of information readily available in the physical environment . Internal search occurs any time memory is accessed , whether it is for the purpose of recollecting items from a list or generating a set of hypotheses ( Thomas , Dougherty , Sprenger , & Harbison , 2008 ) . Regardless of the nature of the task , people must at some point decide to terminate search . In some cases , the decision to terminate is marked by the successful retrieval of a single target memory . In other circumstances , it may not Correspondence should be addressed to Erika K .

For example , two situations that involve memory search termination are verbal - ﬂ uency tasks and free - recall tasks , in which participants must retrieve as many items as possible from either a semantic category or a pre - viously studied list . Verbal - ﬂ uency tasks require that the participant search an ill - de ﬁ ned and poten - tially large sample space to ﬁ nd semantic associates of a cue . In contrast , free - recall tasks involve an objectively well - de ﬁ ned search space that is typi - cally relatively small — with the size dependent on the design of the experiment — such that the par - ticipant must separate recently learned items ( i . e . , those on the list ) from prior experiences . A shared feature of both of these tasks and many others is that the participant must decide when and on what basis to terminate search — that is , unless the experiment is designed in a way to obviate this element of the search process by , for example , providing participants with a time limit for how long search can last . The goal of the present research is to under - stand the mechanisms that in ﬂ uence how people terminate memory search in free - recall tasks and to examine the in ﬂ uence of self - terminated memory search on characteristics of the retrieval process . Since most memory retrieval experiments use a predetermined recall interval where partici - pants are given a ﬁ nite amount of time to recall items from a recently presented list ( e . g . , Anderson & Bower , 1972 ; Kahana , Howard , Zaromb , & Wing ﬁ eld , 2002 ; Rohrer & Wixted , 1994 ) , there is an experimental void of accurate measurements of retrieval time in order to evaluate stopping decisions . This is because in most recall studies the experimenter controls the duration of the retrieval interval , such that participants typi - cally are not given the opportunity to overtly indi - cate when they have stopped trying to retrieve additional items within this ﬁ nite interval . As a result , it is unclear whether participants persist in search for the entire allotted time or opt to truncate search prior to the expiration of the preset interval . Even though search termination decisions are ubi - quitous in nonlaboratory memory tasks , and many of the computational models of free recall assume that participants make termination decisions during the retrieval process ( e . g . , Anderson , Bothell , Lebiere , & Matessa , 1998 ; Raaijmakers & Shiffrin , 1981 ) , few studies ( Dougherty & Harbison , 2007 ; Harbison , Dougherty , Davelaar , & Fayyad , 2009 ; Klein , Addis , & Kahana , 2005 ; Shiffrin , 1970 ; Unsworth , Brewer , & Spillers , 2011 ) have examined memory processes in con - texts in which memory search is self - terminated . The difference between self - terminated ( open - interval ) and predetermined ( closed - interval ) memory search tasks is illustrated in Figure 1 . For the purposes of this example , assume that partici - pants are engaged in a free - recall task in which they are instructed to retrieve multiple items from memory . In a closed - interval paradigm ( Figure 1A ) , the experimenter decides the total amount of time ( e . g . , 10 s , 45 s , or 5 min ) allowed for retrieval . In contrast , in an open - interval paradigm ( Figure 1B ) , participants are allowed to terminate search on their own and can , in principle , spend an inde - ﬁ nite amount of time on any particular list . Thus , open - interval designs allow the participant — rather than the experimenter — to determine the total time spent in search . Although the closed - interval paradigm allows for precise control of recall trials and makes it poss - ible for participants to demonstrate asymptotic levels of recall , one major disadvantage of the design is that there is no latency measurement of participants ’ search termination decisions . In con - trast , the open - interval paradigm licenses the measurement of total time spent in search , making it possible for additional latency measures to be computed ( e . g . , exit latency , or the time between the ﬁ nal retrieval and the termination of memory search , see Dougherty & Harbison , 2007 , and Figure 1 ) . While total time and exit latency represent ﬁ ne - grained assessments of the retrieval process ( compared to recall rates and errors ) , they have proven to follow a surprisingly lawful pattern across experiments and participants . For example , Harbison and colleagues ( 2009 ) found that 85 – 95 % of individual subjects in two separate experiments showed the same basic pattern of data for total time and exit latencies : THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY , 2014 , 67 ( 2 ) 395 SELF - TERMINATED MEMORY SEARCH D o w n l o a d e d by [ B i r kb ec k C o ll e g e ] a t 08 : 15 16 F e b r u a r y 2014 Total time increased and exit latency decreased as a function of number of words retrieved ( see also Unsworth et al . , 2011 ) . Importantly , this behav - ioural regularity was anticipated by only one of the four stopping rules tested — namely , the total number of failures rule ( cf . Raaijmakers & Shiffrin , 1980 ) , which posits that memory search is terminated based on the total number of retrieval failures . Additional evidence for a number of fail - ures rule comes from Unsworth and colleagues ( 2011 ) who demonstrated that recall errors tended to precede search terminations . Related to this , our earlier simulations demonstrate that error patterns correlate with exit latencies , such that exit latencies decrease as more retrieval errors are committed ( see Harbison , Davelaar , Yu , Hussey , & Dougherty , in press ) . Therefore , total amount of search time and the exit latency may be diagnostic for assessing the mechanisms ( i . e . , stop - ping rules ) governing the termination of memory search . While previous work has made progress in describing the behavioural regularities involved with self - terminated memory search ( Dougherty & Harbison , 2007 ; Harbison et al . , 2009 ; Unsworth et al . , 2011 ) , there has not been a direct comparison between open - and closed - interval memory retrieval . Anecdotally , inspection of data presented in Dougherty and Harbison ( 2007 ) and Harbison et al . ( 2009 ) suggests that Figure 1 .

D o w n l o a d e d by [ B i r kb ec k C o ll e g e ] a t 08 : 15 16 F e b r u a r y 2014 many of the data patterns generated using an open - interval retrieval paradigm are consistent with pre - viously collected data from closed - interval retrieval . However , there is one apparent discrepancy : The pattern of interretrieval times ( IRTs ) appears to be qualitatively distinct in the open - interval paradigm . An IRT refers to the amount of time that has passed between two successive retrievals ( e . g . , the time between the ﬁ rst and the second retrieval , the second and the third , etc . ; see Figure 1 ) . IRTs have played an important role in explaining memory retrieval ( Rohrer , 1996 ; Rohrer & Wixted , 1994 ; Wixted & Rohrer , 1994 ) and are generally well described by the equation : IRT i = t N − i ( 1 ) for i = 1 , 2 , . . . , N – 1 , where i is the interresponse interval starting with the interval between the ﬁ rst and second retrievals ; tau ( τ ) is the estimated mean retrieval latency ; and N is the total number of items retrieved . Equation 1 captures the key empirical result that IRTs typically follow a hyper - bolic function , such that the time between succes - sive retrievals increases ( Murdock & Okada , 1970 ; Polyn , Norman , & Kahana , 2009 ; Rohrer & Wixted , 1994 ; Wixted & Rohrer , 1994 ) . More speci ﬁ cally , if reciprocally transformed IRTs ( 1 / IRT ) are plotted from the ﬁ nal retrieval interval to the ﬁ rst retrieval interval , the result is a line with slope 1 / τ that crosses the intercept at zero during closed - interval retrieval ( see Rohrer , 1996 ) . These results are taken as strong support for a relative - strength model of recall , because Equation 1 is predicted by the equal memory strength variant of the model , and in the presence of a recovery threshold , the unequal memory strength version of the model predicts the same pattern ( Rohrer , 1996 ) . Contrary to Rohrer ’ s ﬁ nd - ings , Figure 2 shows that the 1 / IRT data generated from participants in an open - interval retrieval task from Dougherty and Harbison ( 2007 ) and from Harbison et al . ( 2009 , Experiment 1 ) are not well ﬁ tted by Equation 1 . In particular , the intercept is consistently and substantially greater than 0 ( ranging from . 275 to . 495 ) . The discrepancy is particularly prevalent at the ﬁ nal IRT , where participants did spend signi ﬁ cantly more time retrieving the ﬁ nal item than what Equation 1 predicts . Are these open - interval retrieval results at odds with the relative - strength model or do they re ﬂ ect separate search termination rules implemented by participants performing an open - interval task ? To test this , we adopted the simulation methodology used by Rohrer ( 1996 ) to establish the predictions of the relative - strength model . The implemented model randomly sampled items from memory with replacement based on their relative activation . A sampled item was deemed recovered if its acti - vation exceeded an absolute activation threshold of 0 . 5 . Our simulations used the same deterministic threshold as that of Rohrer ( 1996 ) , as well as the same activation distributions ( see below ) . The only change was the inclusion of a memory search stopping rule ; in particular , we implemented the total number of retrieval failures rule previously found to account for open - interval retrieval data ( Harbison et al . , 2009 ) . According to this rule , par - ticipants are sensitive to the total number of retrie - val failures they experience during recall , where a retrieval failure is any retrieval attempt that does not produce a new memory item . In the case of the reported simulations , a retrieval failure was de ﬁ ned as one of the following : ( a ) sampling an item that did not meet or exceed the recovery threshold or ( b ) resampling an item ( i . e . , rep - etitions ) . Once the maximum number of retrieval failures ( the stopping threshold ) was reached , the model terminated search . Note that we included two sets of simulations , each of which maintained different assumptions regarding the recovery threshold : As sketched above , following from Rohrer ( 1996 ) , the ﬁ rst set of simulations assumed a deterministic threshold such that acti - vations must exceed some speci ﬁ ed value ( 0 . 5 ) to be recovered . The second set of simulations main - tained a probabilistic threshold akin to that implemented in Search of Associative Memory model ( SAM ; Raaijmakers & Shiffrin , 1980 , 1981 ) , wherein items are recovered in proportion to their activation levels .

Note that all of the activations tested in Rohrer ( 1996 ) showed the same pattern of results . In our simulations , the reciprocal IRTs , and in particular the ﬁ nal reci - procal IRT , were found to vary as a function of the stopping threshold . When the stopping threshold was higher , the intercept was closer to zero , mimicking the effects seen during a closed - interval retrieval period , consistent with Rohrer ’ s 1996 model . Moreover , by comparing Figures 2 and 3A , it is apparent that the results reported from the open - interval designs of Harbison et al . Figure 2 .

As shown in Figure 3B , the untransformed IRT data demonstrate a larger impact of variation in the stopping threshold than the reciprocal IRTs in Figure 3A . Perhaps surprising , despite the large ﬂ uctuations in the last IRT , adjusting the stopping threshold had a relatively minor impact on the number of items retrieved . Number recalled varied from 5 . 35 to 5 . 97 for one activation pattern and 4 . 35 to 4 . 97 for the other with slightly more items anticipated for the closed block , whereas changes in the ﬁ nal IRT varied from 3 . 35 to 8 . 12 and 3 . 38 to 8 . 43 , respectively , with longer IRTs predicted for larger thresholds of a number of failures stopping rule within an open - interval retrieval period . This demonstrates that the number of failures stopping rule in ﬂ uences temporal properties more than recall rates . Probabilistic recovery threshold Next , we conducted simulations assuming a prob - abilistic recovery threshold similar to that implemented in SAM . In particular , items were deemed recoverable proportionate to their acti - vation levels . Figure 3C depicts the untransformed IRT results of these simulations for stopping thresholds from 10 to 30 in increments of 10 . Similar to the deterministic thresholds ( in Figures 3A and 3B ) , stopping thresholds had signi ﬁ cant effects on the last IRT , but minor in ﬂ uences on Figure 3 .

Namely , the last IRT varied from 3 . 16 s to 6 . 90 s , such that longer IRTs were present for larger number of failures thresholds ( see Figure 3C ) . Alongside the deterministic threshold above , the underlying predictions of the role of a number of failures stopping rule were largely unaffected by recovery assumptions put forth by each model ; speci ﬁ cally , we varied the recovery threshold — as deterministic versus probabilistic — and observed the same IRT patterns as a function of the stopping threshold , such that fewer number of failures resulted in ﬂ atter overall IRT functions than did greater number of failures . The results of the present simulations suggest that a sampling - with - replacement model equipped with a stopping rule accounts for the differences between the closed - and open - interval paradigms , but only if we assume that the stopping threshold is larger during closed - interval retrieval . This assumption is not unreasonable provided that having additional time drives participants to ﬁ nd more items before ending memory search . Furthermore , note that by not including a stopping rule , we would not expect to see a difference in the IRTs in the open - and closed - interval retrieval con - ditions because the only factor that discriminates these conditions is the termination threshold . Rather , if there is no stopping rule , the ﬁ nal IRTs would be exaggerated in both conditions , given that search would proceed until every list item was retrieved . In fact , the mathematical approxi - mation of such a model would predict that the intercept would cross zero ( akin to Equation 1 ) , because higher probabilities of retrieving the ﬁ nal item on a list — and in this case , all list items — correspond to lower intercepts . In light of these patterns , it is important to note that the empirical evidence for a difference in IRTs Figure 3 .

D o w n l o a d e d by [ B i r kb ec k C o ll e g e ] a t 08 : 15 16 F e b r u a r y 2014 between open - and closed - interval paradigms is only anecdotal . Therefore , we conducted a within - subjects experiment where participants completed blocks of both paradigms to directly compare the temporal dynamics of memory search in each . Based on the model simulations presented above , we predicted that by allotting a set period of time in the closed - interval retrieval block , we would sway participants to adopt a larger threshold on their stopping rule , such that more failures ( e . g . , 30 ) are required to render a search termination decision . Further , we anticipated this stopping rule to manifest as an exaggerated ﬁ nal IRT compared to that of the open - interval retrieval block . Put dif - ferently , allowing participants to terminate search on their own should compel them to quit after fewer failures ( e . g . , 10 ) , leading to a more temporally uniform retrieval trend . Method Participants Forty - nine University of Maryland psychology undergraduate students participated in the Figure 3 . Continued . THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY , 2014 , 67 ( 2 ) 401 SELF - TERMINATED MEMORY SEARCH D o w n l o a d e d by [ B i r kb ec k C o ll e g e ] a t 08 : 15 16 F e b r u a r y 2014 experiment for course extra credit . Block order was counterbalanced between participants such that 27 participants received the open - interval block ﬁ rst , and 22 participants received the closed - interval block ﬁ rst . Stimuli The resulting experiment comprised a 2 ( block type : open vs . closed ) × 4 ( list length : 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 words ) within - subjects design . List length was varied randomly such that all subjects were given four study lists of each of four lengths evenly and randomly within each block . List length was sys - tematically varied for two reasons : First , the unpre - dictable length of various lists may prevent participants from learning exactly how many items were on each list , thereby preventing them from using their knowledge of list length as a guide for how long to continue in search ; indeed , through a quasi - experimental analysis , Unsworth and colleagues ( 2011 ) demonstrated that total search time increases with knowledge of set size , compared to cases when memory list length is not explicitly speci ﬁ ed . Second , we sought to ensure suf ﬁ cient variability in the number of items retrieved to examine IRTs and exit latency as a function of number recalled . This is particularly rel - evant given that more items are recalled from longer list lengths , and recall time is proportional to study list length ( Roberts , 1972 ) . Note that because pre - vious studies investigating the mechanisms of retrieval latencies tend to implement a uniform list length ( e . g . , Murdock & Okada , 1970 ; Rohrer , 1996 ; Rohrer & Wixted , 1994 ) , we caution the reader against comparing the present ﬁ ndings directly to previous work because of this critical design difference . Despite this , we feel that by looking at each list length level separately , we will be able to glean insight into the effects of list length — and , thus , proportion recalled — on retrieval dynamics . Thirty - six word lists were randomly generated for each participant from a list of 280 high - imageability ( M = 577 / 700 ) , high - concreteness ( 578 / 700 ) , moderate - to - high - frequency ( Kucera – Francis fre - quency = 54 ) , single - syllable nouns drawn from the MRC psycholinguistic database ( Coltheart , 1981 ; Wilson , 1988 ) . Procedure In each block ( open vs . closed ) , participants were given a total of 18 lists consisting of two practice trials followed by 16 test trials . During the list pres - entation of each trial , words were presented sequentially at a rate of 3 s per item . Following a study list , participants were given a distractor task that consisted of two simple , timed maths pro - blems . Each problem contained three digits and two operands ( e . g . , 3 * 2 + 1 ) . Each component of the problem was presented sequentially at a rate of 1 s per item . After viewing the ﬁ nal digit of the problem , participants saw an equals sign with a question mark . This prompted them to provide an answer using the keypad ( one of 10 single - digit numbers , 0 – 9 ) . The range of average maths accuracy was 64 . 1 – 98 . 4 , well above the chance threshold of 10 % accuracy ; therefore , we assume that the maths problems suf ﬁ ciently dis - tracted participants from actively rehearsing list items . Additionally , on average , this maths distrac - tion task occupied a 14 . 85 - s interval between the presentation of the ﬁ nal word on the list and the retrieval prompt . Time spent on the distractor task did not vary as a function of block , block order , or number recalled in the experiment ( p s . . 45 ) . Importantly , prior work ( Postman & Phillips , 1965 ) has shown that a 15 - s ﬁ lled interval is suf ﬁ cient to eliminate the contribution of short - term memory for long - term memory retrieval . Consistent with this , we ﬁ nd attenuated recency effects , such that the probability of recalling later list items is no different from recalling intermediate list items , t ( 186 ) = – 1 . 76 , p . . 08 ; however , the probability of recalling earlier list items is greater than that for intermediate list items , t ( 194 ) = 13 . 21 , p , . 001 , compatible with a classic primacy effect . During open trials , participants were given control over when to end the retrieval interval . Participants were told to press the spacebar when they could no longer retrieve additional items from the most recently studied memory list . An unlimited amount of time was provided for 402 THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY , 2014 , 67 ( 2 ) HUSSEY ET AL . D o w n l o a d e d by [ B i r kb ec k C o ll e g e ] a t 08 : 15 16 F e b r u a r y 2014 participants to verbally recall the words presented on each word list ( cf . Dougherty & Harbison , 2007 ) . The following typed instructions were pre - sented prior to starting : “ During the retrieval period , please try to recall as many words as you can . You will be given as much time as you need to recall the words . When you feel as though you cannot recall any additional words , please press the spacebar to terminate the trial . ” During closed retrieval blocks , participants were given 45 s to retrieve the memory list items . The following typed instructions were pre - sented prior to starting : “ During the retrieval period , please try to recall as many words as you can . You will be given a set amount of time to recall the words . When the time has expired , you will see a screen asking you to press a button in order to begin the next trial . ” Based on prior research , we anticipated that a 45 - s retrieval interval would provide ample time for most participants to complete the recall task . Moreover , this retrieval interval has been used in other research ( e . g . , Kahana et al . , 2002 , Experiment 2 ) and is well beyond the average dur - ation that participants in our prior studies spent retrieving when provided with the option to self - terminate search ( see Dougherty & Harbison , 2007 ; Harbison et al . , 2009 ) . All subjects were presented with both block types to ensure a proper comparison of IRTs between the open and closed intervals , and the order of block pres - entation was counterbalanced across participants . All retrievals were made verbally by speaking into a microphone and were digitally recorded for later scoring . The responses for each list were hand - coded to extract the items recalled and the time - to - word associated with each . Coding Using Audacity© audio - analysis software , we ret - rospectively analysed all aspects of the retrieval data with millisecond accuracy . Two separate coders analysed the verbal recall data to include : ( a ) all words that were produced by each participant on each trial , ( b ) the time stamps of the verbal onset of all generated words , and ( c ) the time stamps indicating retrieval termination for open - interval trials ( i . e . , times associated with spacebar presses ) . Total number of items recalled , the average number of intrusions ( i . e . , repetitions and previous and extraexperimental false alarms ) , and interretrie - val times were analysed separately at each list length for the open - and closed - retrieval blocks for each participant . Exit latencies were also computed at each list length for each participant on open blocks only . IRTs were examined as a function of list length , number recalled , and block type .

JZS BF tests include a parameter , r , used to index expected effect sizes ; because we have no hypotheses with respect to effect size , r was set a priori to a default value of 1 . 0 .

Some comparisons are expected to support the null hypothesis , and JZS BFs provide a means to assess the degree to which this is indeed the case . Bayes - factor tests re ﬂ ect the likelihood of support for the alternative hypothesis over support for the null hypothesis , such that for t tests , coef ﬁ cients less than 0 . 1 index strong support for the null hypothesis and those less than 0 . 3 index substantial support for the null hypothesis , while those greater than 3 index substantial support for the alternative hypothesis , and those greater than 10 strongly support the alternative hypothesis . All analyses are conducted with respect to two variables of interest : block type ( open vs . closed ) and list length ( 5 vs . 7 vs . 9 vs . 11 ) .

Exit latency cannot be computed for trials in the closed - interval block , so we examined the effect of block order and list length on exit latency only on open - interval trials and found no main effect , F ( 1 , 192 ) = 0 . 4069 , p . . 52 . Finally , there were no reliable effects of block order , block type , and list length for IRTs at any level of number recalled ( p s . . 09 ) . Because these early analyses suggest that there are no effects of block order , all subsequent analyses collapsed across this factor . Number recalled We next conducted an ANOVA with factors block type ( open vs . closed ) and list length ( 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 ) on the total number of words recalled . This test failed to reach signi ﬁ cance , F ( 3 , 388 ) = 0 . 011 , p . . 92 ; however , as can be seen in Figure 4A , there was a main effect of list length , F ( 1 , 194 ) = 31 . 33 , p , . 001 , BF . 100 , but no signi ﬁ cant difference in the number of items retrieved between the closed - and open - interval trials , F ( 1 , 96 ) = 0 . 596 , p . . 44 , BF = 0 . 149 ; see Table 1 ) . Note , however , that quantitatively the closed block resulted in slightly more items recalled than the open block . The same series of patterns held when only correctly recalled items were considered , such that the interaction of block type and list length failed to reach signi ﬁ cance , F ( 3 , 388 ) = 0 . 011 , p . . 92 , but there was a main effect of list length , F ( 1 , 194 ) = 14 . 215 , p , . 001 , BF . 100 , such that more items are recalled with longer list lengths , though no effect of block type , F ( 1 , 96 ) = 0 . 224 , p . . 64 , BF = 0 . 125 ; see Figure 4B and Table 1 ) . That is , participants generated more correct words in the closed - than open - interval trials , though this difference did not reach signi ﬁ cance . While there was no signi ﬁ cant differ - ence in number recalled as a function of block type , note that the simulations presented above predicted that the closed interval would render slightly more items retrieved than the open interval , as we observed . Analyses of recall errors ( i . e . , intrusions and rep - etitions ) are also consistent with this conclusion : The average number of intrusions did not differ as a function of list length and block type , F ( 3 , 384 ) = 0 . 382 , p . . 77 . Intrusion rates did not change as a function of time spent in the exper - iment for any list length in either block ( p s . . 09 ; BFs , 0 . 432 ) . Moreover , the interaction of list length and block type failed to reach signi ﬁ cance when intrusions were split into three types ( F s , 1 . 916 ; p s . . 13 ) : ( a ) extraexperimental false alarms , or items recalled that were not presented during any prior studied lists in the experiment ( left panel of Figure 4C ) ; ( b ) previous - list false alarms , or items that were incorrectly output that occurred on previous memory lists within the experiment ( centre panel of Figure 4C ) ; and ( c ) repetitions ( right panel of Figure 4C ) . There was a reliable main effect of list length for previous - list false alarms where more intrusions were observed with longer list lengths , F ( 3 , 192 ) = 4 . 130 , p , . 01 ; see Table 1 ) , but no main effects reached signi ﬁ cance for the remaining intrusion measures ( p s . . 18 ) . Despite this , the mean number of previous - list intrusions never exceeded 0 . 25 in either block at any list length , indicating that although this main effect exists , it is negligible with respect to interpreting how these intrusions may manifest as a function of list length . Given these results , we are comfortable concluding that the open - interval paradigm does not differ substan - tially from the closed - interval paradigm in terms of number and type recalled , even in the presence of various list lengths . Exit latency , total time , and time - to - last The open - interval design provides the unique opportunity to measure total self - paced search time and exit latency during a retrieval period . We found the current data to be consistent with previous ﬁ ndings using an open - interval paradigm , 404 THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY , 2014 , 67 ( 2 ) HUSSEY ET AL .

Mean within - subject gamma ( γ ) correlation coef ﬁ - cients for exit latency and number recalled ( M = – . 139 , SD = . 26 ) indicate that participants take longer to terminate search after the ﬁ nal item is recalled when fewer words are output in a trial ( one - sample t test of γ ) , t ( 48 ) = – 3 . 719 , p , . 001 , BF = 43 . 731 ) . Furthermore , one - sample t tests of gamma at each list length indicated that this pattern holds for all lengths greater than 5 ( see Table 2 ) . Also consistent with previous data , participants spent more overall time searching at longer list lengths , borne out by a reliable main effect of list length , F ( 1 , 194 ) = 37 . 301 , p , . 001 , BF . 100 ; see Table 3 ) . Moreover , participants spent signi ﬁ cantly less total time searching in the open - interval condition at all list lengths than in the 45 - s closed - interval period ( t s . 18 . 74 ; p s , . 001 ) . We next examined time - to - last , or the amount of time it takes from ﬁ rst starting a retrieval interval to generating the ﬁ nal recalled item . We observed a signi ﬁ cant main effect of list length , F ( 1 , 194 ) = 46 . 475 , p , . 001 , BF . 100 , but no effect of block type , F ( 1 , 96 ) = 1 . 0358 , p . . 31 , BF = 0 . 184 . That is , the closed - interval condition resulted in a longer time - to - last than the open - interval condition , t ( 48 ) = 29 . 43 , p , . 001 , BF . 100 . Additionally , longer list lengths resulted in longer time - to - last , consistent with the patterns observed for total time searching and exit latency ( see Table 3 ) . Table 1 .

D o w n l o a d e d by [ B i r kb ec k C o ll e g e ] a t 08 : 15 16 F e b r u a r y 2014 Interretrieval times Interretrieval times ( IRTs ) were computed by taking the difference between the verbal onset times for each subsequent item recalled in a trial . We conducted these irrespective of the identity of the item recalled ( i . e . , IRTs were computed to incorporate trials containing intrusions to boost the number of observations per cell ) . We reported the data including intrusions for consist - ency with Rohrer ( 1996 ) . Moreover , it is unlikely that subjects who output intrusions are aware of such errors during the experiment . Therefore , these items should have little effect on temporal dynamics associated with recall . Including or excluding intrusions did not result in different patterns of the IRT results presented below ; thus all subsequent analyses include intrusions to increase the number of observations per cell . We ﬁ rst examined IRTs as a function of list length ( 5 vs . 7 vs . 9 vs . 11 ) and block type ( open vs . closed ) for each level of number recalled for each participant . Since many participants did not output a full range of number recalled levels across both open - and closed - interval blocks , pair - wise comparisons only included data from subjects that could contribute to both levels of block type for a given list length and number recalled level . For example , it was possible that a participant recalled three items in two separate trials with a list length of 7 of the open - interval block and never recalled three items in any trials with a list length of 7 of the closed - interval block . Because of this variation in observations , we only report IRT averages when at least 10 subjects contributed data to both open and closed intervals for a given list length . Also , to be consistent with the simulation ﬁ ndings reported above , Figure 5 only includes data for 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , and 7 items recalled . Figure 5A illustrates the IRTs for open and closed blocks as a function of number recalled , block type , and list length . Upon visual inspection , two patterns that separate open and closed blocks are apparent : First , a more linear trend is seen for IRTs of open - interval trials ( left panels ) than for those of closed - interval trials ( right panels ) , which instead follow a more hyperbolic trend ( akin to that seen in Rohrer , 1996 ) . Similar results were found using SAM : By assuming various list lengths , we simulated IRTs as a function of number of failures ( 10 or 20 ) for the list lengths of 5 , 7 , 9 , and 11 , consistent with the design of the present study . Figure 5B illustrates that assum - ing a larger stopping threshold ( e . g . , 20 failures ; right panels ) , the ﬁ nal IRT is exaggerated across all list lengths compared to cases when fewer fail - ures are needed to terminate search ( e . g . , 10 ; left panels ) . Note also that this pattern holds regardless of the number of items recalled — a factor that is plotted as separate lines within each panel of Figure 5A — and list length . Moreover , by examin - ing and comparing the leftmost panels of Figures 5A and 5B , we see a consistent trend across the simulation patterns and observed data , where lower stopping thresholds ( as are expected within open - interval blocks ) yield ﬂ atter IRT curves than Table 3 .

One discrepancy , however , involves IRTs at list length 5 : The model predicts a slight upward in ﬂ ection on the last IRT of the closed block , an effect that we do not see in the observed data . Given that recalling ﬁ ve items is a relatively easy task for most participants , that the closed block follows the same trajectory as the open block when only ﬁ ve items must be recalled may not be terribly surprising . Rather , this might re ﬂ ect a case in which a smaller stopping threshold is utilized in the closed block because few failures are made when fewer items must be retrieved . Especially important to relationship between interretrieval time and the retrieval interval is the last IRT ( see Figure 6 ) . Although there was not an interactive effect of block type and list length for the last IRT , F ( 1 , 375 ) = 3 . 230 , p . . 07 , there was a main effect of block type , F ( 1 , 96 ) = 8 . 399 , p , . 01 ; BF = 5 . 635 , such that closed - interval trials led to longer ﬁ nal IRTs than open - interval trials . There was also a main effect of list length , where longer ﬁ nal IRTs accompanied longer list lengths , F ( 1 , 194 ) = 32 . 21 , p , . 001 ; BF . 100 ; see Table 3 . Corrected pairwise com - parisons of block type for the last IRT at each list length revealed in the following pattern : List length of 5 did not show a reliable difference for last IRT , but list lengths greater than 5 resulted in a clear effect of block ( see Table 4 ) . Upon rever - sing the retrieval interval and examining the last - 1 , last - 2 , and last - 3 IRTs , we observed no reliable block type and list length interactions ( p s . . 19 ) , but all three measures demonstrated signi ﬁ cant main effects of list length ( F s . 6 . 26 , p s , . 01 , BFs . 20 . 87 ) , and only the last - 3 IRT resulted in a main effect of block type , F ( 1 , 94 ) = 4 . 444 , p , . 05 , BF = 0 . 926 ; other IRT measures : p s . . 08 ; see Table 4 for a comprehensive break - down of the means for each IRT measure ) .

Taken together , despite that there were no signi ﬁ - cant differences in number recalled ( albeit a small , statistically unreliable advantage for the closed block ) , there do appear to be differences in the tem - poral dynamics between open - and closed - interval blocks , an effect mostly driven by the ﬁ nal IRT . Speci ﬁ cally , the observed block type differences re ﬂ ect the comparison of the previous open - interval data ( see Figure 2 depicting patterns from Dougherty & Harbison , 2007 , and Harbison et al . , 2009 ) with data from closed - interval exper - iments ( see Rohrer , 1996 ) , as well as the predic - tions of the sampling - with - replacement models detailed above . Namely , the closed block results in similar IRT functions to the simulations assum - ing larger stopping thresholds . In addition to list length and number recalled , IRTs are also in ﬂ u - enced by stopping threshold , a characteristic that is probably sensitive to retrieval interval type . In addition to examining the mean IRTs for block type and list length , we also conducted a model - based analysis of the IRT functions . Rohrer and Wixted ( 1994 ) showed that Equation 1 ( above ) provided a reasonable ﬁ t to IRT data col - lected using a closed - interval design . We used this equation to estimate retrieval latencies ( τ ) separately for the open - and closed - interval blocks at each list length for individual participants . Tau provides an index of IRT magnitude and , thus , primarily re ﬂ ects the magnitude of later IRTs , because according to Equation 1 , these later IRTs are the longest . An Figure 6 .

D o w n l o a d e d by [ B i r kb ec k C o ll e g e ] a t 08 : 15 16 F e b r u a r y 2014 individual ﬁ t was obtained for each subject . The interaction of block type and list length did not reach signi ﬁ cance , F ( 1 , 352 ) = 2 . 260 , p . . 13 ; however , we observed main effects of block type , F ( 1 , 94 ) = 16 . 481 , p , . 001 , BF . 100 , and list length , F ( 1 , 194 ) = 16 . 481 , p , . 001 , BF . 100 . The average retrieval latency was shorter for open - interval than for closed - interval trials ( see Figure 7 and Table 5 ) , indicating that participants spent less time searching memory between retrievals in the open - than in the closed - interval condition . As shown in Figure 6 , much of this reduction is due to the ﬁ nal IRT . The average latency generally increased as a function of list length ( see Figure 7 and Table 5 ) . Indeed , pairwise comparisons of block for τ at each list length corroborated this ﬁ nding at list lengths 7 , 9 , and 11 ( t s . 1 . 94 , p s , . 05 , BFs . 0 . 49 ) , but not at length 5 , t ( 42 ) = 1 . 819 , p . . 07 , BF = 0 . 418 . As an aside , the average modelling ﬁ t indices , or root mean square errors ( RMSEs ) suggest that Equation 1 better accounts for the closed - interval than the open - interval condition , F ( 1 , 94 ) = 6 . 572 , p , . 05 , BF = 2 . 469 . The RMSEs were also larger for longer list lengths , F ( 1 , 190 ) = 10 . 178 , p , . 01 , perhaps indicating that Equation 1 provides a better characterization of IRT func - tions when not all items are easily recalled , which is generally the case at longer list lengths . This explanation is also consistent with the predictions related to number of failures in the simulations described above . Although the interaction of block type and list length were not reliable , F ( 1 , 352 ) = 0 . 816 , p . . 36 , the main effects of both factors indicate that the closed - interval trials result in longer estimated retrieval latencies as given by later retrieval intervals ( the last IRT ) and thus provide a better ﬁ t of the IRT function given by Equation 1 . Finally , pairwise comparisons of block type for the RMSEs at each list length pat - terned with the comparisons reported above for last IRT ( see Figure 7 and Table 5 ) . To summarize , list length of 5 did not show a reliable difference for last IRT , t ( 43 ) = 0 . 342 , p . . 73 , BF = 0 . 089 , but list lengths greater than 5 resulted in effects of block ( t s . 2 . 074 , p s , . 05 , BFs . 0 . 68 ) . Discussion The present experiment directly compared a closed - interval design , in which the experimenter determines the length of the retrieval interval , to an open - interval design , in which participants are allowed to terminate their own memory search . Though number of items recalled did not vary sig - ni ﬁ cantly across retrieval designs , the IRT func - tions did : Compared to their closed - interval counterparts , open - interval trials resulted in overall shorter ﬁ nal average IRTs , lower estimated mean retrieval latencies ( τ ) , and nominally poorer ﬁ ts to a classic IRT function ( Equation 1 ) , a set of effects that generally held for all list lengths greater than 5 items .

THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY , 2014 , 67 ( 2 ) 411 SELF - TERMINATED MEMORY SEARCH D o w n l o a d e d by [ B i r kb ec k C o ll e g e ] a t 08 : 15 16 F e b r u a r y 2014 What do these differences in the IRTs mean ? According to the simulations presented above , these results suggest a difference in the stopping threshold between open - and closed - interval retrieval . As shown in Figure 3 , the relative - strength model , when equipped with the stopping rule supported by existing patterns ( see Harbison et al . , 2009 ; Unsworth et al . , 2011 ) , predicts a positive correlation between the ﬁ nal IRT and the stopping threshold . To explain the present results , we must assume that a stopping threshold changes ; that is , in the absence of a stopping rule , the model is liable to show exaggerated ﬁ nal IRTs as it searches until all list items are recov - ered . In other words , the present simulations suggest that a stopping rule with variable thresholds must be included to capture the retrie - val interval effect : When the stopping threshold is suf ﬁ ciently large ( e . g . , 20 – 30 failures ) , the ﬁ nal IRT is also large , and the IRT predictions are consistent with Equation 1 ; speci ﬁ cally , the inter - cept of the inverse of the IRTs is 0 when plotted in reverse order ( Rohrer , 1996 ) . However , when the stopping threshold is set to smaller values ( e . g . , 10 failures ) , the ﬁ nal IRT is smaller , decreasing the predicted slope ( or 1 / τ ) and increasing the intercept . Thus , with small stopping thresholds , the results are similar to the open - interval design and inconsistent with Equation 1 . These patterns are consistent with our hypothesis that participants adopt a larger stopping threshold when the experimenter allots a long interval for retrieval in a closed - interval design than the threshold that is adopted when termination is under the control of the partici - pant . Interestingly , this effect holds despite the open - interval paradigm actually allowing for more time for retrieval ( theoretically in ﬁ nite ) than the closed - interval design , suggesting that stopping thresholds are actually re ﬂ ective of the experimental paradigm , not the time needed for retrieval . A potential strength of the closed - interval design is that it leads to an increased stopping threshold , priming participants to search memory longer and possibly for the entire predetermined retrieval inter - val . Consistent with this , participants often reach asymptotic levels of recall when provided ample time to retrieve items ( Rohrer , 1996 ; Rohrer & Wixted , 1994 ; Wixted & Rohrer , 1994 ) . If measur - ing search performance for a set interval is an exper - imental goal , then the participants searching for more of that interval is certainly positive , given that recall rates and intrusions are aptly captured during closed intervals . However , in using such a design , it is dif ﬁ cult to ascertain exactly how long participants spend in search , other than knowing that it extends beyond the time of the ﬁ nal item retrieved . Perhaps , under the proper experimental demands , stopping rules may be measured using a closed - interval design wherein subjects are motivated to continue searching throughout the entirety of the retrieval period by being rewarded for every item Figure 7 .

D o w n l o a d e d by [ B i r kb ec k C o ll e g e ] a t 08 : 15 16 F e b r u a r y 2014 produced . Evidence for this stems from recent work demonstrating that employing a cost / bene ﬁ t structure in ﬂ uences retrieval dynamics especially when correct retrievals are rewarded ( Davelaar , Yu , Harbison , Hussey , & Dougherty , 2013 ) . Despite this , another possible drawback of the closed - interval design is that under certain conditions , it may have less ecological validity than an open - ended paradigm . For example , people typically do not have a time limit ( e . g . , 45 s ) as explicitly de ﬁ ned as that often provided in recall studies while search - ing their memories during everyday tasks . This is not to say that closed intervals are not encountered from day to day ; indeed , time pressure often prompts us to strategically control aspects of our retrieval perhaps similar to that used during a closed interval . Within our rubric , time pressure should impact the threshold for deciding when to terminate search . In other words , retrieval is a dynamic process that changes as a function of task demands , and this often forces people to adopt different mechanisms to search memory . Our simulation work suggests that this is probably the case . As a result , when making predictions about general memory use and about what role memory serves in other cognitive activities ( e . g . , judgement and problem solving ) , it is important to note that results from the closed design might not be the most representative . The present research indicates that the IRT function ( given by Equation 1 ) is one such ﬁ nding that does not appear to transfer beyond the closed - interval design , perhaps suggesting a reason for the lack of generalization . Importantly , however , although the present research indicates that the IRT function ( given by Equation 1 ) does not appear to transfer beyond the closed - interval design , one detail to highlight is that Rohrer and Wixted ’ s ( 1994 ) original results were based on a model that did not include a stopping rule . As the current ﬁ ndings indicate , the inclusion of such a threshold may be the factor driving retrieval interval effects . Additionally , Equation 1 was not originally ﬁ tted to a data set derived from variable list lengths ; that is , this model did not predict effects associated with list length . That we show better ﬁ ts for closed blocks at longer list lengths is a potential by - product of this important difference . One way to overcome this issue is to design a study to examine the effects of block type with list length constant . Experimentally , the present study has impor - tant implications for researchers designing free - recall studies in terms of deciding precisely how long to allow participants to retrieve items . Knowledge of how recall is affected by the time allotted within an experimental trial is critical when deciding whether to prescribe a recall time — and if so , how long — or to leave the decision entirely up to the participant . The ﬁ ndings of the present study may help to identify how to make future free - recall studies more experimentally ef ﬁ - cient . In particular , we demonstrate that providing participants with a 45 - s recall period resulted in a small , but nonsigni ﬁ cant increase in the number of items recalled compared to the open - interval condition ( which on average lasted 15 . 44 s ) , even in the face of varying list lengths ( 9 . 75 s for short , 5 - word lists and 18 . 47 s for longer , 11 - word lists ) . This suggests that the length of exper - iments utilizing closed - interval trials may be trun - cated to save on the time required to collect data . On the other hand , experimenters who choose to implement open - interval recall designs may need to consider whether little change in number recalled ( compared to a closed - interval ) is occur - ring at a cost to the quality of recall timing . To this end , there are important theoretical consider - ations when deciding on how long to allow partici - pants to retrieve items from memory : For example , Roberts ( 1972 ) demonstrated that recall time was proportional to the number of words in a study list . By prescribing additional recall time ( a natural by - product of the closed - interval design ) , we build on this ﬁ nding by demonstrating that the ﬁ nal IRT increased with the number of to - be - remembered list items ( see Figure 6 ) , but did so systematically so as to maintain a difference between open and closed blocks across varying list lengths . Next , we wish to point out that in several analyses the list length factor was shown to make a difference . Initially , we employed the random list length THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY , 2014 , 67 ( 2 ) 413 SELF - TERMINATED MEMORY SEARCH D o w n l o a d e d by [ B i r kb ec k C o ll e g e ] a t 08 : 15 16 F e b r u a r y 2014 procedure in order to prevent idiosyncratic retrieval strategies based on counting due to knowledge of the total number of words in each list . The main effect of list length on total number of items recalled , previous - list intrusions , exit latency , time - to - last , total time , and last IRT is in line with previous work ( see Harbison et al . , 2009 ; Murdock , 1962 ; Roberts , 1972 ) . Importantly , none of the analyses reported here revealed an interaction between list length and block type , although most of the list - length effects on temporal measures were mediated by the differential number of items recalled : The shortest list length ( i . e . , 5 ) might evoke a difference in retrieval strategy , given by the lack of block effect at this list length . In a series of papers , Ward and colleagues ( Grenfell - Essam & Ward , 2012 ; Grenfell - Essam , Ward , & Tan , 2013 ; Ward , Tan , & Grenfell - Essam , 2010 ) varied list length from 1 to 15 in a free recall paradigm and noticed that output order was sensitive to list length , such that shorter list lengths resulted in participants reporting items in a forward order ( similar to serial recall ) , whereas items were reported in a more typical last - items - ﬁ rst manner at longer list lengths . Although we used a delayed free - recall procedure instead of their immediate free - recall tasks , differences in output order may in ﬂ uence the temporal measures . In a computational study comparing IRTs in serial recall and free recall , Davelaar ( 2007 ) showed that at a given list length , serial recall produces shorter IRTs than free recall . It is , thus , not inconceivable that in the present study , list length 5 induced a different retrieval strategy from those used at list lengths 7 , 9 , and 11 . One possibility that may account for the observed block type effects may have to do with different strategies implemented for each block . This is to say that perhaps the instructions provided to participants ( see Method / Procedure above ) during the closed block did not deter them from continuing search in a new way after outputting all initial items . Because participants were not explicitly told to stop and wait for the retrieval period to expire following any natural stopping points prior to the end of the 45 - s interval , it is possible that separate strategies may have been inci - dentally developed during the open and closed retrieval blocks . Although we cannot rule out these possibilities entirely given the present design , we can point to a few patterns that suggest otherwise . First , and perhaps most obvious , since number recalled — or number cor - rectly recalled — did not vary signi ﬁ cantly as a func - tion of block type at any list length ( p s . . 30 ) , any strategy with the goal to output more items would not be different across both blocks ( however , note that the small , consistent increase in number of items recalled for the closed block may be due to a real effect that we are failing to detect statistically ) . Perhaps related , the subtle , but non - signi ﬁ cant trend for fewer overall recalls in the open - ended condition may be consistent with an interpretation favouring the latent encouragement to continue searching memory when more time than needed is available for retrieval ( as is the case in the closed - interval block ) . Indeed , by this interpretation , subjects may engage in search longer than they otherwise might prefer , given by a decision they would signal by truncating an open - interval trial . As a result , longer ﬁ nal IRTs would re ﬂ ect cases when additional items are inci - dentally output in the closed block . Next , not all list lengths showed the effect of block type for last IRT : At list lengths longer than 5 , we did observe an effect of block , such that the closed block had signi ﬁ cantly longer last IRTs than the open block ; however , at the shortest list length ( 5 words ) , we did not see this effect , perhaps ( as suggested above ) pointing to a strategy change that was sensitive to the number of items in a list . Thus , it is plausible that in the closed block when there are fewer items to remember , one strategy is implemented , but a separate strategy is used in all other instances . Regardless , if a separate strategy can account for performance differences seen across block , it is probably driven by a number of failures stopping rule given by the tight mapping between the observed data and the predic - tions generated by the simulations presented earlier . In closing , the present research illustrates that providing participants with a closed - interval design yields systematic differences in the temporal characteristics of memory retrieval compared to the open - interval design . Our data and analyses suggest 414 THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY , 2014 , 67 ( 2 ) HUSSEY ET AL . D o w n l o a d e d by [ B i r kb ec k C o ll e g e ] a t 08 : 15 16 F e b r u a r y 2014 that one likely cause of this difference is the threshold for terminating memory search : Participants are assumed to have a larger threshold on their stopping rule during a closed - interval task . The open - interval design allows us to capture this by making the stopping decision explicit to the subject and the experimenter , a factor important for evaluating computational models of memory . Importantly , the latencies associated with stopping decisions appear to provide valuable data for eluci - dating the mechanisms governing memory search termination . The open interval design is useful when speci ﬁ cally studying stopping rules and timing of retrieval , providing valuable information beyond recall rates and errors .
