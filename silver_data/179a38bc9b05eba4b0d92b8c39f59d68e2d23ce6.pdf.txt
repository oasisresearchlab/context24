Given that COVID - 19 primarily spreads in densely populated indoor areas , urban public transport ( UPT ) systems pose significant risks . This study presents an analysis of the air change rate in buses , subways , and high speed trains based on measured CO 2 concentrations and passenger behaviors . The resulting values were used as inputs for an infection risk assessment model , which was used to quantitatively evaluate the effects of various factors , including ventilation rates , respiratory activities , and viral variants , on the infection risk . The findings demonstrate that ventilation has a negligible impact on reducing average risks ( less than 10 . 0 % ) for short - range scales , but can result in a reduction of average risks by 32 . 1 % – 57 . 4 % for room scales . When all passengers wear masks , the average risk reduction ranges from 4 . 5 - folds to 7 . 5 - folds . Based on our analysis , the average total reproduction numbers ( R ) of subways are 1 . 4 - folds higher than buses , and 2 - folds higher than high speed trains . Additionally , it is important to note that the Omicron variant may result in a much higher R value , estimated to be approximately 4 . 9 - folds higher than the Delta variant . To reduce disease transmission , it is important to keep the R value below 1 . Thus , two indices have been proposed : time - scale based exposure thresholds and spatial - scale based upper limit warnings . Mask wearing provides the greatest protection against infection in the face of long exposure duration to the omicron epidemic . 1 . Introduction The COVID - 19 pandemic is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , which belongs to the family of coronaviruses that can infect humans . This virus is the seventh member of the coronavirus family that can infect humans , as documented in several academic papers [ 1 – 3 ] . To date , multiple variants of SARS - CoV - 2 have emerged as prevalent epidemic strains in numerous countries , with several posing significant risks to human health [ 4 ] . These include Alpha [ 5 ] , Beta [ 6 ] , Gamma [ 7 ] , Delta [ 8 ] , and Omicron [ 9 ] . According to Ref . [ 10 ] ; the global death toll from January 1 , 2020 , to December 31 , 2021 , exceeded 18 million . From January 2022 on - wards , the Omicron variant has become the dominant strain worldwide , with higher transmissibility but lower severity , as reported by Ref . [ 11 ] . As of December 2022 , almost three years into the COVID - 19 pandemic , the number of diagnosed cases reported globally has exceeded 660 million and is still increasing , according to the World Health Organi - zation ( WHO ) ( https : / / covid19 . who . int / table ) . However , there are likely more additional cases beyond those officially reported to the WHO . China , which is the world ’ s most populous country , ceased reporting the number of infected cases in December 2022 . Ongoing research on the transmission mechanism of SARS - CoV - 2 has led [ 12 ] to propose a more comprehensive definition of the three primary trans - mission routes as inhalation , spray , and surface contact . Additionally , the airborne transmission route , namely inhalation , deserves more attention considerably than that of surface contact [ 78 ] , especially for Omicron [ 13 ] . Urban public transport ( UPT ) , which includes buses , subways , and high speed trains , is associated with high passenger density , a high crowding index , and variable duration , making it conducive to disease transmission [ 14 , 15 ] . Unlike other modes of transportation such as * Corresponding author . College of Civil Engineering and Architecture , Zhejiang University , Hangzhou , China .

The annual total number of passengers using buses , subways , and high speed trains in China from 2017 to 2021 [ 76 ] . Although the total passenger traffic decreased in 2020 , it remained at a significant level and continued to increase in 2021 , raising concerns about the potential infection risks in UPT . Therefore , it is essential to assess the infection risk and implement measures to ensure the public ’ s inelastic travel needs while preventing the spread of COVID - 19 . Numerous studies have investigated the risk of aerosol transmission in UPT systems . Many of these studies , such as those by Refs . [ 16 , 17 ] ; have utilized regression or bivariate correlation analyses to demonstrate significant associations between UPT use and infection incidence . Based on a regression analysis of data from the location - based services data - base [ 18 ] , identified a robust and statistically significant correlation between train travel and the incidence of 2019 - nCoV cases . Furthermore [ 16 ] , reported significant positive linear correlations between trip fre - quency ( i . e . , flights , buses , and trains ) , and case incidence ( i . e . , daily or cumulative ) in China . Based on fixed effects regression modeling [ 19 ] , found that reductions in mobility had a prominent effect on reproduc - tion numbers [ 20 ] . reported that the attack rate decreased with increasing social distance , but increased with increasing co - travel time on high speed trains , based on their study . However , the studies mentioned above have not provided a comprehensive quantitative analysis of infection risk at transmission scales in UPT . The transmission scale can be vital in assessing and mitigating risks [ 75 ] . Indoor transmission scenarios in Fig . 1 are divided into short - range and room - scale [ 21 ] . The room - scale transmission is thought to represent long - distance transmission [ 22 ] , with susceptible individuals in shared indoor spaces being at a distance of more than 2 m from an infected person ( denoted as an index case ) . The short - range transmission is defined as a distance of less than 2 m or 6 feet between two individuals in many papers [ 23 – 25 , 77 ] . Many transmissions and even super spreading events ( SSEs ) have been induced by asymptomatic individuals without sneezing or cough - ing , which has contributed to the rapid spread of COVID - 19 in crowded Nomenclature ACH Air change rate per hour ( h (cid:0) 1 ) BR i exhalation rate of an index case ( m 3 h (cid:0) 1 ) BR s exhalation rate of susceptible individuals ( m 3 h (cid:0) 1 ) C r background quanta concentration ( quanta m (cid:0) 3 ) C o quanta concentration released by an infector ( quanta m (cid:0) 3 ) C ro initial background quanta concentration ( quanta m (cid:0) 3 ) C average CO 2 concentrations during the calculation period ( ppm ) C a fraction of CO 2 contained in the exhaled air ( ppm ) C E environmental CO 2 concentrations ( ppm ) c v viral load ( copies mL (cid:0) 1 ) c i conversion factor ( quanta copies (cid:0) 1 ) ER q quanta emission rate ( quanta h (cid:0) 1 ) f transmission enhancement coefficient I number of the index case IR cp 01 individual ’ s infection risk at the short - range scale ( 0 – 1 m ) ( % ) IR cp 12 individual ’ s infection risk at the short - range scale ( 1 – 2 m ) ( % ) IR rs individual ’ s infection risk at the room - scale ( % ) k deposition rate ( h (cid:0) 1 ) m p human body ’ s mass ( kg ) N 1 number of susceptible individuals at the short - range ( 0 – 1 m ) N 2 number of susceptible individuals at the short - range ( 1 – 2 m ) N rs number of susceptible individuals located at the room - scale N event total number of individuals P I individual ’ s infection probability ( % ) P cp 01 individual ’ s infection probability at the short - range scale ( 0 – 1 m ) ( % ) P cp 12 individual ’ s infection probability at the short - range scale ( 1 – 2 m ) ( % ) P rs individual ’ s infection probability at the room - scale ( % ) P ERq probability of occurrence of each ER q Q outdoor fresh air volume ( m 3 s (cid:0) 1 ) R cp 01 infection reproduction number at the short - range scale ( 0 – 1 m ) R cp 12 infection reproduction number at the short - range scale ( 1 – 2 m ) R rs infection reproduction number at the room - scale t Exposure duration ( h ) TIL c combined total particles inward leakage rate ( % ) TOL c combined total particles outward leakage rate ( % ) V volume of a shared indoors ( m 3 ) V 0 volume of modules ( m 3 ) V net net volume of the compartment ( m 3 ) V jd droplet volume concentration ( mL m (cid:0) 3 ) x distance from the source ( m ) Greek symbols γ fraction of infectious aerosols ( % ) λ virus inactivation rate ( h (cid:0) 1 ) ρ p human body ’ s density ( kg m (cid:0) 3 ) Acronyms CDC centers for disease control and prevention COVID - 19 coronavirus disease - 2019 CFD computational fluid dynamics ET exposure threshold ET i time interval of exposure threshold SSEs super spreading events SARS - CoV - 2 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 TJWR turbulent jet Wells - Riley UPT urban public transport UVGI ultraviolet germicidal irradiation Fig . 1 . Illustration of the relationship between short - range and room - scale exposure in confined indoor environments [ 21 ] . Y . Feng et al . Building and Environment 242 ( 2023 ) 110489 3 indoor environments with poor ventilation [ 26 – 28 ] . Furthermore , in - dividuals breathe much more frequently than they cough , and thus , quiescent breathing or speaking might generate more airborne particles containing infectious viruses over time [ 75 ] [ 29 ] . demonstrated that poor ventilation , i . e . , insufficient air changes per hour ( ACH ) , increased the risk of respiratory infections at the short ranges . However , the impact of various non - pharmacological interventions , such as main - taining social distance , increasing ventilation , and wearing masks , as well as the effects of COVID - 19 variants ( e . g . , Delta and Omicron ) , respiratory activities ( e . g . , quiescent breathing or speaking ) , and other factors on transmission risks , has not been adequately quantified . This study aims to quantify the transmission risks in crowded UPT settings , such as buses , subways , and high speed trains , and to identify effective non - vaccine control strategies for reducing potential trans - mission in the post - COVID era . Therefore , careful evaluation of the multi - scale risks in closed environments of the UPT with insufficient ventilation is necessary [ 4 ] . The paper is structured as follows . Section 2 presents the overall infection risk assessment method and the back - ground of field measurements and modeling in the three typical UPT , including buses , subways , and high speed trains . Section 3 presents the analysis of assessment results of the infection risk and reproduction number and a comparison of mitigations on the reduction level of risks . Finally , the discussion is presented in Section 4 , with the conclusions drawn in Section 5 . 2 . Methods In this study , we evaluated the short - range and room - scale risks in buses , subways , and high speed trains based on the COVID - 19 risk assessment model proposed by Ref . [ 25 ] . Field measurements were conducted to provide data on typical passenger behaviors and ACH . 2 . 1 . Estimation of the ventilation rate Based on field measurements of CO 2 concentrations in compartments and the CO 2 tracer gas - decay method , exhaled concentrations through breathing , the number of total passengers , outdoor fresh air volume Q ( m 3 s (cid:0) 1 ) , and ACH ( h (cid:0) 1 ) can be calculated using Eqs . ( 1 ) – ( 3 ) proposed by Refs . [ 30 , 31 ] . V net = V (cid:0) V 0 (cid:0) N event × m p ρ p ( 1 ) V net × C 2 (cid:0) C 1 △ t = N event × BR × C a + ( C E (cid:0) C ) × Q ( 2 ) ACH = 3600 × Q V net ( 3 ) where V net ( m 3 ) is the air volume of the enclosure ; V ( m 3 ) is the total volume of the enclosure ; V 0 ( m 3 ) is the volume of modules occupied by the seats , transitional steps , air ducts on both sides of the interior compartment , and among others , which are calculated and subtracted ; m p ( kg ) is the human ’ s body mass ; ρ p ( kg m (cid:0) 3 ) is the human ’ s body density , using a mean body mass of 70 kg and a density of 1 . 01 × 10 3 kg m (cid:0) 3 [ 32 ] ; BR ( m 3 s (cid:0) 1 ) is the breathing rate of individuals ; which is determined by activity levels and is approximately 1 . 36 × 10 (cid:0) 4 m 3 s (cid:0) 1 and 1 . 50 × 10 (cid:0) 4 m 3 s (cid:0) 1 for resting and standing , respectively [ 33 ] . and C 2 ( ppm ) are the CO 2 concentrations at time t 1 and time t 2 , respectively ; △ t ( s ) is the calculation period , i . e . , △ t = t 2 - t 1 ; C a is the fraction of CO 2 contained in the exhaled air , which is commonly assumed to be 4 % based on previous studies [ 34 ] ; C E ( ppm ) is environmental CO 2 con - centration with a typical value of 400 ppm [ 35 , 36 ] ; C ( ppm ) is the average CO 2 concentration during the period △ t ; and N event represents the total number of individuals in a closed environment shared with an infected person . To measure the real - time CO 2 concentrations , three portable multifunctional composite gas analyzers ( JK90 - M9 , Gishunan Technology Shenzhen , China ) equipped with CO 2 sensors with a range of 0 – 10 , 000 ppm and a resolution of 1 ppm were used . The passenger behaviors were recorded with micro - network cameras ( V8 - 8 , Suodun , Dongguan , China ) . ACH was calculated when the number of passengers was maintained relatively stable . In summary , the values of V , V 0 , C 1 , C 2 , △ t , and N event were derived from field measurements and video recordings , while the values of m p , ρ p BR , C E , and C a were obtained from the literature [ 32 – 36 ] . The measurement routes used in this study included Hangzhou Bus Line 193 ( model type : BYD K9A ) , Hangzhou Subway Line 2 ( model type : Type B ) , and a high speed train ( model types : CR400 or CRH 300 ) from Hangzhou to Shanghai , as marked in Fig . 2 . Further information on the measurement routes is provided in Table 1 . Based on the actual geometric size , layout , and passenger behaviors recorded on video , top views of buses , subways , and high speed trains in crowded conditions ( full load condition ) are illustrated in Fig . 3 fol - lowed by Ref . [ 37 ] . The locations of CO 2 sensors and cameras are marked in Fig . 3 . The locations of the index case and susceptible in - dividuals within short - range 1 and 2 were indicated by red and light red shading . Four types of activities , including quiescent breathing + resting , quiescent breathing + standing , speaking + resting , and speaking + standing , were considered . Different characteristic zones have been classified in UPT ( Fig . 3 ) , including seating zone A ( marked by a blue frame ) and standing zone B ( marked by a yellow frame ) . In subways , standing zone B is further divided into standing zone B1 - door and standing zone B - window ( Fig . 3b ) . To determine the highest contact rates between infected and susceptible passengers , the index case is located in the standing zones , as these areas typically have the highest contact rates . In the case of “ standing zone B ′′ in high speed trains , it was found that salespersons and a few standing ticket passengers stayed for longer periods . During the actual measurements , the subway compart - ments were crowded with passengers . To improve the readability of Fig . 3b and due to the high consistency of activity characteristics within the same zone , passengers in the remaining zones of Fig . 3b are not drawn simultaneously . 2 . 2 . Evaluation of the individual ’ s infection risk In the TJWR model , the quanta emission rate ( ER q , quanta h (cid:0) 1 ) is an essential parameter for infection risk assessments [ 25 ] . To obtain this parameter , a forward calculation method ( Eq . ( 4 ) ) is applied based on the viral load , type of respiratory activity , respiratory parameters , and activity level [ 38 ] . The forward calculation method allows for easy accessibility of each relevant parameter , in contrast to the backward calculation method ( retrospective assessments ) , which depends on critical factors such as actual infection rate , actual ventilation , exposure duration , and respiratory activity . The backward calculation method was applied to estimate the ER q of an infector based on a real infectious outbreak only at the end of an epidemic [ 39 ] . However , one of these critical details is often partially missing , and building data are difficult to obtain , even though significant outbreaks have been documented [ 40 ] . Therefore , the forward calculation method is employed in this study , which is also useful for evaluating the impact of different respi - ratory activities on infection risk [ 41 ] . ER q = f × c v × c i × BR ic × V jd ( 4 ) where c v ( copies mL (cid:0) 1 ) is the viral load of an index case . The average and standard deviation of log 10 c v is equal to 7 and 0 . 71 , respectively [ 41 ] ; c i ( quanta copies (cid:0) 1 ) is a conversion factor expressed by c i = 1 / ( c RNA × c PFU ) . The average ( ± standard deviation ) of c RNA ( copies PFU (cid:0) 1 ) and c PFU ( PFU quanta (cid:0) 1 ) are equal to 210 ( ± 21 ) and 130 ( ± 13 ) respectively [ 41 ] ; BR ic ( m 3 h (cid:0) 1 ) is the exhalation rate of an index case , i . e . the same value as BR taken in Eq . ( 3 ) ; V jd ( mL m (cid:0) 3 ) is the droplet volume concentration exhaled by an index case , which also depends on Y . Feng et al . Building and Environment 242 ( 2023 ) 110489 4 respiratory activities ( e . g . , breathing and speaking ) . The average ( ± standard deviation ) of V jd for breathing and speaking is equal to 2 × 10 (cid:0) 3 ( ± 5 × 10 (cid:0) 4 ) and 9 × 10 (cid:0) 3 ( ± 2 × 10 (cid:0) 3 ) , respectively [ 41 , 42 ] ; f represents the transmission enhancement coefficient , which is defined as the ER q ratio of the Pre - Delta strain to different variant strains ( e . g . , Delta or Omicron ) . Combining with the basic reproduction number ( R o ) , the value of ER q in f is determined by the fitting curve from the study conducted by Ref . [ 43 ] . f is equal to 1 , 10 . 8 , and 30 . 1 for Normal , Delta , and Omicron , respectively [ 25 ] . The background quanta concentration ( C r ) in confined indoor environments ( V jd , quanta m (cid:0) 3 ) can be calcu - lated with Eq . ( 5 ) . We consider that C r is perfectly mixed in Eq . ( 5 ) , in line with the assumption made by Refs . [ 23 , 44 ] ; and [ 41 ] . V net × dC r dt = ER q × I (cid:0) IVRR × V net × C r ( 5 ) where C ro ( quanta m (cid:0) 3 ) denotes the initial quanta concentration in shared indoor environments ( generally assumed to be zero ) ; I is the Fig . 2 .

Building and Environment 242 ( 2023 ) 110489 5 number of the index case ( generally assumed to be constant ) ; t ( h ) is the exposure duration of the index case ; and IVRR ( h (cid:0) 1 ) is the removal rate of the infectious virus , which can be attributed to the following three factors [ 45 ] . First , ACH , based on the volume of virus - free air , which depends on the volume of fresh outdoor air , volume filtration of the returned air ( HEPA ) , and volume of air goes through ultraviolet germicidal irradiation ( UVGI ) [ 9 ] . Second , the deposition rate of infec - tious particles on surfaces due to gravity , k ( h (cid:0) 1 ) , with a typical value of 0 . 24 h (cid:0) 1 [ 46 ] . Third , the virus inactivation rate , λ ( h (cid:0) 1 ) , has a typical value of 0 . 63 h (cid:0) 1 [ 47 ] . Combining C r calculated by Eq . ( 5 ) with the steady - state mass conservation law near the index case and susceptible individuals ( x ≤ 2 m ) and the turbulent jet theory , the quanta concen - tration C at the inhalation position is written as Eq . ( 6 ) . According to the dilution coefficient of the jet and the typical human mouth diameter of D = 20 mm , the average dilution ratio of aerosol concentration S can be written as 0 . 32 x / D [ 23 , 48 ] . Thus the TJWR model can be written as Eq . ( 7 ) to calculate the individual ’ s infection probability ( P I ) . The suscep - tible individual ’ s infection probability at the room - scale ( P rs ) can be obtained by Eq . ( 8 ) . By combining with P rs ( Eq . ( 8 ) ) and the probability of occurrence of each ER q ( P ER q ) , the infection risk at the room - scale ( IR rs ) can be obtained with Eq . ( 9 ) . C = C r + D 0 . 32 x × ( C o (cid:0) C r ) ( 6 ) P I = 1 (cid:0) exp { (cid:0) TIL c × TOL c × BR si × ∫ t 0 [ C r + D 0 . 32 x ( C o (cid:0) C r ) ] dt } ( 7 ) P rs = 1 (cid:0) exp ( (cid:0) TIL c × TOL c × BR si × ∫ t 0 C r dt ) ( Room (cid:0) scale ) ( 8 ) IR rs = ∫ ER q [ P ER q × P rs ] dER q ( Room (cid:0) scale ) ( 9 ) where C o ( quanta m (cid:0) 3 ) is the quanta concentration released by the index case , i . e . , C o = ER q / ( γ × BR ic ) ; x ( m ) is the distance from the source along the flow direction ; BR si ( m 3 h (cid:0) 1 ) is the inhalation rate of suscep - tible individuals ; TIL c ( % ) is the combined total particles inward leakage rate of the mask worn by susceptible individuals ; and TOL c ( % ) is the combined total particles outward leakage rate of the mask worn by an index case [ 49 ] . Since the viral load is assumed to share the same con - centration for each virus - laden aerosol or droplet [ 50 , 51 ] , TIL c and TOL c can be defined as the ratio of total volume inside and outside masks , instead of the number concentration . In contrast to large particles , more small particles exhaled by the index case are lower in volume ( lower quanta concentration ) [ 44 , 52 , 53 ] . In addition , small particles have a higher probability of penetrating masks because masks are generally less effective in filtering small particles compared to large particles [ 49 ] . When defining the filtering efficiency of masks as a ratio of the number of particles inside and outside masks , a lower value of filtering efficiency is obtained . Therefore , based on a more reasonable volume concentra - tion inside and outside masks , TIL c and TOL c can be written as Eq . ( 10 ) and Eq . ( 11 ) respectively . TOL c = ∑ j = s , b i = 1 , 2 , 3 TOL i × F i , j × d 3 i ∑ j = s , b i = 1 , 2 , 3 F i , j × d 3 i ( 9a ) TIL c = ∑ j = s , b i = 1 , 2 , 3 TIL i × TOL i × F i , j × d 3 i ∑ j = s , b i = 1 , 2 , 3 TOL i × F i , j × d 3 i ( 10 ) where F i , j represents the proportion of different particle sizes ( i = 0 . 3 – 1 . 0 μ m ; 1 . 0 – 3 . 0 μ m ; 3 . 0 – 10 μ m ) when breathing ( j = b ) and speaking ( j = s ) ; d i is the typical diameter ( 0 . 7 μ m , 2 . 0 μ m , and 6 . 0 μ m for 0 . 3 – 1 . 0 μ m , 1 . 0 – 3 . 0 μ m , and 3 . 0 – 10 μ m , respectively ) ; and TOL i represents the outward leakage rate of masks for particles with a particle size of i . The values of F i , j and TOL i ( TIL i ) are shown in Table 2 . The values of TIL c and TOL c are presented in Table 3 . During quiescent breathing and speaking , the virus - laden aerosol concentration is higher near the source in the jet zone at the short - range , which poses a higher risk during face - to - face interaction with an index case . Airborne transmission risk at the short - range is evaluated using the jet equation , which considers the aerosol concentration as a function of distance x ( x ≤ 2 m ) in the jet zone [ 23 , 54 ] . A threshold distance of 2 m seems to be effective under the assumption of an ideal steady jet based on the study of [ 55 ] . The locations at x = 0 . 5 m and x = 1 . 5 m are used as the representative values for short - range 1 ( 0 – 1 m ) and short - range 2 ( 1 – 2 m ) , respectively . Similarly to the calculation of P rs , the susceptible individual ’ s infection probability at the short - range ( P cp 01 and P cp 12 ) can be obtained by Eqs . 12 and 13 . The infection probability P cp 01 ( short - - range 1 ) and P cp 12 ( short - range 2 ) ( % ) in the two sub - zones mentioned above can be written as Eqs . ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) , respectively . where γ is the fraction of infectious aerosols in suspended aerosols in the expired jet that remain suspended in the room - scale zone [ 23 ] . Assuming perfectly mixed indoor air and the mass conservation law , C r can be obtained . Similarly , steady - state mass conservation law near the index case and susceptible individuals ( x ≤ 2 m ) , and γ is introduced to calculate C o [ 23 ] . Thus , the quanta concentration at the inhalation po - sition of the susceptible individuals within the short - range can be ob - tained [ 25 ] .

Feng et al . Building and Environment 242 ( 2023 ) 110489 6 Ref . [ 23 ] . It is worth noting that when an index case wears a mask , the exhaled jet containing high virus concentrations can be blocked by the mask , and its dispersal can be disrupted . The study by Ref . [ 56 ] found that the total aerosol concentration level measured in front of the mask was similar to the room ’ s background level . Therefore , in this paper , the calculation of risks at the short - range 1 and 2 ( P cp 01 and P cp 12 ) refers to Eq . ( 8 ) , i . e . , the same infection probability as at the room - scale ( P rs ) . Similarly , for the short - range scale , risks of the two sub - zones short - - range 1 and 2 are expressed as IR cp 01 ( % ) and IR cp 12 ( % ) , respectively , and calculated using Eqs . 14 and 15 , respectively . IR cp 01 = ∫ ER q [ P ER q × P cp 01 ] dER q ( Short (cid:0) range 1 ) ( 14 ) IR cp 12 = ∫ ER q [ P ER q × P cp 12 ] dER q ( Short (cid:0) range 2 ) ( 15 ) The infection reproduction number for the room - scale and short - range are denoted as R rs and R cp , respectively , which can be obtained with Eqs . 16 – 18 . Moreover , the total infection reproduction number ( R ) can be calculated using Eq . ( 19 ) . R rs = IR rs × N rs ( Room (cid:0) scale ) ( 16 ) N rs = ( N event (cid:0) N 1 (cid:0) N 2 (cid:0) 1 ) ( 17 ) R cp = R cp 01 + R cp 12 = N 1 × IR cp 01 + N 2 × IR cp 12 ( Short (cid:0) range ) ( 18 ) R = R cp + R rs ( 19 ) where R cp 01 and R cp 12 represent the infection reproduction number at the short - range 1 and 2 , respectively ; and N rs represents the number of susceptible individuals located at the room - scale . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Statistics of CO 2 concentrations and calculation of ACH in UPT Based on the field measurements , boxplots of CO 2 concentrations in buses , subways , and high speed trains are plotted in Fig . 4 . According to the chronological order of measured dates in Table 1 , different dates are named as follows . For example , measurements in buses on different dates are denoted as Case1 - B to Case5 - B respectively . Similarly , mea - surements in subways and high speed trains are denoted as Case1 - S to Case4 - S and Case1 - H to Case10 - H respectively . The terms “ Cases - B ′′ , “ Cases - S ′′ , and “ Cases - H ′′ represent the aggregated measurements . As shown in Fig . 4a , for different measured dates , the average CO 2 concentration during the peak periods and off - peak periods ranged from 813 ppm to 2967 ppm , from 407 ppm to 1569 ppm , respectively [ 57 ] . conducted field sampling in buses with an arithmetic average CO 2 concentration of 959 ppm , which agreed with our results . Similarly , in subways , the average CO 2 concentration during the peak and off - peak periods ranged from 757 ppm to 1245 ppm , from 627 ppm to 890 ppm , respectively . For Cases - B and Cases - S , the average CO 2 concen - tration during the peak periods was 2 . 2 - folds and 1 . 3 - folds higher than in off - peak periods , respectively . The CO 2 concentrations ( ranging from 1160 ppm to 1550 ppm ) in high speed trains are relatively stable , which is related to the relatively strict control of the environmental parame - ters . The average CO 2 concentration in buses was the highest , which was nearly 1 . 8 - folds greater than in subways and 1 . 4 - folds greater than in Fig . 4 .

Feng et al . Building and Environment 242 ( 2023 ) 110489 7 high speed trains . For buses , when setting the air conditioning system to the recirculation mode with closed windows and at a low driving speed , the fresh air would be greatly reduced , resulting in elevated CO 2 con - centrations in buses [ 57 , 58 ] . High CO 2 concentration is an indicator of inadequate ventilation , which can lead to high infectious aerosol con - centrations and increase the transmission risks of COVID - 19 [ 14 ] . Moreover , prolonged exposure of passengers and drivers to high CO 2 concentration can cause sleepiness , fatigue , and even decision - making performance [ 59 ] . Based on Eqs . ( 1 ) – ( 3 ) , ACH is calculated and shown in Fig . 5 . As all windows in buses are openable , passengers have the opportunity to in - crease ventilation by opening windows for fresh air . Videos recorded during field measurements indicated a higher frequency of passengers opening windows in May during the measurements of Case3 - B , Case4 - B , and Case5 - B . The opening of windows tends to significantly increase the value of ACH . Therefore , measurements in buses were divided into two groups , i . e . , Group 1 - B ( Case1 - B and Case2 - B ) , and Group 2 - B ( Case3 - B , Case4 - B , and Case5 - B ) . The average ACH in Group 2 - B was 2 . 7 - folds higher than in Group 1 - B due to the opening of windows . As displayed in Fig . 5 , the ACH of buses , subways , and high speed trains ranged from 2 h (cid:0) 1 to 20 h (cid:0) 1 ( 9 h (cid:0) 1 on average ) , 8 h (cid:0) 1 to 22 h (cid:0) 1 ( 16 h (cid:0) 1 on average ) , and 4 h (cid:0) 1 to 11 h (cid:0) 1 ( 8 h (cid:0) 1 on average ) , respectively . Therefore , the typical values of ACH can be set as 5 h (cid:0) 1 , 10 h (cid:0) 1 , and 15 h (cid:0) 1 for buses , 10 h (cid:0) 1 , 15 h (cid:0) 1 , and 20 h (cid:0) 1 for subways , and 5 h (cid:0) 1 and 10 h (cid:0) 1 for high speed trains . These values will be used as sub - sequent inputs in the TJWR model to assess the risks of COVID - 19 transmission . According to N event in Table 1 and typical values of ACH , and it is assumed that the total passengers are 100 % , 75 % , 50 % , and 25 % of N event , respectively , ventilation rate per person ( L s (cid:0) 1 p (cid:0) 1 ) could be obtained . The corresponding results are shown in Fig . 6 . According to Ref . [ 75 ] , the typical , poor , and high ventilation rate per person is defined as 5 – 10 L s (cid:0) 1 p (cid:0) 1 , less than 3 L s (cid:0) 1 p (cid:0) 1 , and more than 25 L s (cid:0) 1 p (cid:0) 1 , respectively for highly occupied space . It is assumed in this study that each circumstance ( rectangular cell in Fig . 6 ) occurs with an equi - probable event in terms of total passengers and ACH . Fig . 6 indicates that the proportion of below - typical ( < 5 L s (cid:0) 1 p (cid:0) 1 ) / poor ( < 3 L s (cid:0) 1 p (cid:0) 1 ) ventilation scenarios is 75 % / 33 % for buses , 75 % / 50 % for subways , and 13 % / 0 % for high speed trains , respectively . Moreover , when the total passenger is 25 % of N event , the ventilation rate can satisfy the typical value . However , as the total passenger increased , the ventilation rate per person decreased significantly and could even reach 1 . 1 L s (cid:0) 1 p (cid:0) 1 . When it increased to 50 % of N event for the subways and 75 % of N event for buses , the ventilation rate per person was less than 5 L s (cid:0) 1 p (cid:0) 1 regardless of ACH . Therefore , for buses and subways , when the total passenger exceeded 50 % of N event , additional fresh air must be supplied . For high speed trains , the ventilation rate per person was less than 5 L s (cid:0) 1 p (cid:0) 1 only when ACH was equal to 5 h (cid:0) 1 and the total passenger was 100 % of N event . The above findings highlight the importance of conducting infection risk assessments for high - occupancy UPT systems in the post - epidemic era . 3 . 2 . Infection risk assessments at the short - range and room - scale Based on Eq . ( 8 ) and Eqs . 13 and 14 , assuming that the index case is quiescent breathing or speaking with minimum typical ventilation ( ACH = 5 h (cid:0) 1 for buses ; ACH = 10 h (cid:0) 1 for subways ; ACH = 5 h (cid:0) 1 for high speed trains ) , IR cp 01 , IR cp 12 , and IR rs are calculated . According to the principle that R is less than 1 , two parameters of time - scale based exposure thresholds are proposed , i . e . , the infectious exposure threshold ( h ) ( ET : duration when R rs , R cp 01 , R cp 12 = 0 . 5 ) and the time interval of exposure threshold ( h ) ( ET i : the duration interval when R rs , R cp 01 , R cp 12 = 0 . 5 (cid:0) 1 . 5 ) . Based on the rounding principle , ET represents the possible minimum duration when R rs , R cp 01 , R cp 12 = 1 . ET i represents the time interval of the exposure threshold when R cp 01 , R cp 12 , and R rs are approximately equal to 1 . That is , there is a possibility that the repro - duction number is equal to 1 at any moment within this interval ET i . ET and ET i can guide for the public to avoid overstaying . Results of infec - tion risk assessment at the multi - scale are illustrated in Fig . 7 . The res - piratory status of the index case is presented using a cube ( square ) and a sphere ( circle ) to represent breathing and speaking , respectively . The infection risk threshold is defined as the minimum risk value when R rs , R cp 01 , R cp 12 ≈ 1 , which depends on the number of passengers at the short - range and room - scale . The infection risk thresholds at different scales are marked in Fig . 7 with grey horizontal planes , with circum - stances above grey planes filled with red solid symbols ( early warning ) , and others filled with green hollow symbols . Based on N 1 / N 2 / N event in Table 1 , the infection risk threshold at the short - range 1 was 7 . 1 % , 6 . 3 % , and 25 . 0 % , and those for short - range 2 were 4 . 2 % , 3 . 4 % , and 7 . 1 % , respectively . The infection risk threshold at the room - scale was 0 . 78 % , 0 . 23 % , and 0 . 62 % , respectively . For Delta or Omicron , although the index case keeps quiescent breathing , R cp ≥ 1 still occurs less than 0 . 1 h with a shorter ET . At the short - range , the infection risk threshold in subways was approximately 11 . 3 % ( short - range 1 ) and 19 . 0 % ( short - range 2 ) less than in buses . Similarly , the infection risk threshold in buses was 71 . 6 % ( short - range 1 ) and 40 . 8 % ( short - range 2 ) less than in high speed trains . IR rs was still Fig . 5 . Calculated ACH for buses , subways , and high speed trains . Fig . 6 . The calculated ventilation rate per person in buses , subways , and high speed trains with typical values of ACH and total passengers . Y . Feng et al . Building and Environment 242 ( 2023 ) 110489 8 also high for Delta and Omicron , and the respiratory activity of speaking caused a shorter infection risk threshold compared with breathing . At the room - scale , the threshold in subways was 70 . 5 % less than in buses , and the threshold in buses was 25 . 8 % higher than in high speed trains . It should be noted that subways have the highest risks among the three types of UPT , as shown by the results obtained from the short - range and room - scale risk assessments . Based on ordinary least squares analysis [ 60 ] , also noted a significant influence of public transport ( i . e . subways ) on the prevalence of COVID - 19 . Furthermore , the ET at the short - range was lower than at the room - scale , which demonstrates that IR cp 01 and IR cp 12 are extremely high and it is crucial to maintain social distance between passengers . 3 . 3 . Influence of ACH on IR cp 01 , IR cp 12 , and IR rs Reduction level of IR cp 01 , IR cp 12 , and IR rs were evaluated if the index case had different respiratory activities in typical values of ACH ( i . e . , 5 h (cid:0) 1 and 15 h (cid:0) 1 for buses ; 10 h (cid:0) 1 and 20 h (cid:0) 1 for subways ; 5 h (cid:0) 1 and 10 h (cid:0) 1 for high speed trains ) . The reduction level of risks was counted and averaged for different exposure durations ( duration interval : 0 . 2 h for buses , 0 . 2 h for subways , and 0 . 5 h for high speed trains , respectively ) . Results are shown in Fig . 8 . When the increase of ACH , there was only a slight reduction in IR cp 01 and IR cp 12 , but can result in a significant reduction level for room scales . In addition to this , it is found that the reduction level of risks tends to reach a stable value with increasing exposure duration . Fig . 7 .

Y . Feng et al . Building and Environment 242 ( 2023 ) 110489 9 At the short - range 1 , IR cp 01 decreased by an average of 4 % , 2 % , and 3 % in buses , subways , and high speed trains , respectively . At the short - range 2 , IR cp 12 decreased by an average of 7 % , 6 % , and 9 % in buses , subways , and high speed trains , respectively . Results indicate that increasing ACH does not reduce IR cp 01 and IR cp 12 significantly but more obviously for IR cp 12 . At the room - scale , IR rs decreased by an average of 55 % , 42 % , and 41 % in buses , subways , and high speed trains , respec - tively , which show that is more effective to reduce IR rs compared to reducing IR cp 01 and IR cp 12 . For quiescent breathing , increasing ACH leads to a generally higher reduction level of risks than speaking , with an increase of 34 . 1 % at the short - range 1 , 19 . 9 % at the short - range 2 , and 7 . 6 % at the room - scale , respectively . To improve the reduction effect of increasing ACH , it is encouraged to speak less frequently when travelling with urban public transport , especially for short - range scale . For the passengers , they can adjust their location to ensure as much safety as possible , which is defined as the maximum number of pas - sengers allowed to be exposed at the short - range , i . e . , N 1 and N 2 ) . Two exposure duration scenarios are discussed , namely the entire trip and half the trip . the results of which are shown in Table 4 . Even though the ventilation is high ( ACH = 15 h (cid:0) 1 for buses , 20 h (cid:0) 1 for subways , and 10 h (cid:0) 1 for trains ) , the principle of maintaining a dis - tance of over 2 m still needs to be considered , especially if the index case keeps speaking for Omicron . Increasing ACH has only a slight effect on the short - range , as shown in Fig . 8 . As an “ imperfect barrier to spread ” , however , screening ill individuals tends to miss 50 – 75 % of the index cases [ 61 ] . This is mainly because , during the incubation period , some individuals may be asymptomatic , which makes their recognition challenging [ 26 ] . Therefore , it is crucial to consider every passenger as a potential source of infection . Based on the real - time compartment en - vironments , the public can refer to the recommended value in Table 4 as guidance . Similarly , for transit operators , a spatial - scale based upper limit warning is proposed to reasonably control occupancy rates of UPT ( N event ) . the spatial - scale based upper limit warnings of N event in buses , subways , and high speed trains are depicted in Table 5 . The modification of the limit warning was initially performed by considering the maximum occupancy in the compartment , as presented in Table 1 . We define N event (cid:0) co as the rough total number in the compartment ( esti - mated ) for the limit warnings of N 1 and N 2 . Since the N event (cid:0) co is a rough estimate , N event (cid:0) co is determined based on the fact that passengers prefer to choose the seating zone , i . e . , they sit down and do not stand first if a seat is available . N event (cid:0) s is also defined as the limit warning obtained from the TJWR model . In this paper , the focus is not on the exact value of N event (cid:0) co but on only comparing the relationship between the values of N event (cid:0) co and N event (cid:0) s . In a particular case , for scenarios of N 1 = 4 and N 2 = 9 for buses , N 1 = 4 and N 2 = 9 for subways , and N 1 = 4 and N 2 = 7 for trains , it is difficult to obtain the exact N event (cid:0) co . However , it is evident that the relationship between the values of N event (cid:0) co and N event (cid:0) s can be determined . When the value of N event (cid:0) co is lower than N event (cid:0) s , R can be reduced to less than 0 by maintaining the requirement of N 1 and N 2 ( Tables 4 and 5 ) . Conversely , although the limit warnings of N 1 and N 2 are satisfied , N event (cid:0) co may still exceed N event (cid:0) s . In this case , N event (cid:0) s is necessary to be controlled to satisfy the condition that R rs is less than 1 , while maintaining N 1 and N 2 . Moreover , we note that scenarios in which the value of N event (cid:0) s is greater than N event (cid:0) co occur mainly under conditions of longer duration , speaking , poor ACH , and variants ( e . g . , Delta and Omicron ) . Thus , a second modification of N event (cid:0) s is performed , and the minimum between the N event (cid:0) co and N event (cid:0) s is selected as the limit warning of N event . As for different strain variants , the influence ACH on IR rs and R rs is analyzed in Fig . 9 . The light red color indicates R rs = 1 , and R rs increases as the red deepens . The assumption is made that each circumstance represented by a rectangular cell is an equiprobable event . For the Normal strain , the proportion of blue cells in buses , subways , and high speed trains was 91 % , 84 % , and 83 % , respectively . For Delta , the pro - portion of blue cells was 13 % , 9 % , and 10 % , respectively . For Omicron , the proportion of blue cells was 7 % , 0 % , and 5 % , respectively . In other words , IR rs is acceptable in UPT for Normal , ensuring that R rs is less than 1 . However , for Delta and Omicron , R rs > 1 may still occur despite a short exposure duration and high ventilation . IR rs will increase dramatically for Delta and Omicron , which may lead to widespread and even SSEs . When ACH increased by 5 h (cid:0) 1 , the average mitigation level of IR rs for buses were 1 . 6 - folds and 1 . 4 - folds higher than for subways and high speed trains , respectively . Therefore , buses have a greater potential to reduce IR rs by increasing ACH , as indicated by Fig . 6 . The proportion below the typical ventilation rate in buses was the greatest and similar to subways , roughly 5 - folds higher than high speed trains . Based on IR cp 01 and IR cp 12 ( Section 3 . 3 ) , IR rs ( Section 3 . 4 ) , N 1 , N 2 , and N event ( Table 1 ) , total R for a specific circumstance could be obtained under the minimum typical value of ACH ( 5 h (cid:0) 1 for buses ; 10 h (cid:0) 1 for subways ; 5 h (cid:0) 1 for trains ) . To obtain the maximum R for Normal , Delta , and Omicron , it is assumed that the respiratory activity of the index case is speaking . Furthermore , two scenarios of exposure duration were assumed , Table 4 Spatial - scale based upper limit warnings of N 1 and N 2 at the short - range .

Y . Feng et al . Building and Environment 242 ( 2023 ) 110489 10 including the minimum / maximum exposure duration ( i . e . , 0 . 1 h / 1 . 5 h for buses , 0 . 1 h / 1 . 5 h for subways , and 0 . 2 h / 4 . 0 h for high speed trains , respectively ) , and the average R was also calculated per exposure in - terval . Results are shown in Fig . 10 . As seen in Fig . 10 , the total R of buses was 0 . 8 - folds ( average , ranging from 0 . 5 to 1 . 0 - folds ) higher than subways . Similarly , the total R of high speed trains was 0 . 6 - folds ( average , ranging from 0 . 5 to 0 . 8 - folds ) lower than subways . The overall risk level of subways was higher than buses and high speed trains . Compared with the Normal strain , the total R caused by Omicron was 5 . 5 - folds , 4 . 9 - folds , and 4 . 4 - folds higher for buses , subways , and high speed trains , respectively . Moreover , R caused by Delta increased by 3 . 8 - folds for buses , 3 . 2 - folds for subways , and 3 . 0 - folds for high speed trains higher than Normal , respectively . Although improving ventilation ( Section 3 . 3 , Section 3 . 4 ) and maintaining social distance ( Section 3 . 2 ) are both useful , they are not enough to prevent SSEs in high - occupancy UPT considering the high basic reproduction number . Therefore , additional measures such as wearing a mask should be taken , which will be evaluated quantitatively in the following subsection . 3 . 4 . Influence of wearing surgical masks on IR rs IR rs can be obtained based on Eqs . 9 and 10 and data in Table 3 . To facilitate the discussion in the later sections , we have analyzed two common mask - wearing scenarios , namely the index case - wearing sce - nario ( where only the index case wears a surgical mask ) and the both - wearing scenario ( where both the index case and susceptible in - dividuals wear a surgical mask ) . For these two scenarios , the corre - sponding results of IR rs are illustrated in Fig . 11 ( a1 , b1 , c1 ) and Fig . 11 ( a2 , b2 , c2 ) . Compared with the results in Figs . 8 and 9 , there was a significant reduction effect on IR rs when wearing masks . For index case - wearing scenario , IR rs was reduced on average by 81 . 6 % for buses , 80 . 3 % for subways , and 77 . 8 % for high speed trains , respectively , which indicates that the reduction level maintains a high consistency . For buses in Fig . 11 ( a1 ) , the average mitigation level of IR rs was 1 . 5 - folds , 1 . 9 - folds , and 2 . 0 - folds than increasing ACH , respectively . For buses and high speed trains , when the index case was breathing , the exposure duration when R = 1 was 1 . 4 h and 2 . 6 h in Fig . 11 ( a1 , c1 ) . Moreover , the protection time calculated by Ref . [ 62 ] was 1 . 3 h and 2 . 8 h , respectively , which agreed with our results . It can be found from Fig . 11 ( a2 , b2 , c2 ) that the average mitigation effect is greater for the both - wearing scenario , which was 3 . 6 - folds on average for the index case - wearing scenario . Wearing masks properly is a more effective measure compared to solely increasing ventilation . For the both - wearing scenario , R ≥ 1 may appear only during the minimum typical ACH for a longer exposure duration . However , there is also the possibility of R ≥ 1 when susceptible individuals stay for more than 1 . 3 h in subways ( ACH = 15 h (cid:0) 1 ) . It is recommended that all individuals wear a mask to reduce the higher risks generated by speaking , coughing , or overstaying . In general , IR rs of the UPT are acceptable ( IR rs < 1 ) for the both - wearing scenario although under the minimum typical values of ACH ( 5 h (cid:0) 1 for buses ; 10 h (cid:0) 1 for subways ; 5 h (cid:0) 1 for high speed trains ) . 4 . Discussion According to the video recording , most passengers were wearing surgical masks , as shown in Fig . 2d of the snapshots in crowded cir - cumstances . Table 3 suggests that the leakage rate of surgical masks was greater than that of FFP2 masks . To estimate conservatively the effect of wearing a mask on risk mitigation , the protective performance of sur - gical masks was analyzed typically . Different from the 50 % roughly considered [ 43 , 63 ] , the filtration efficiency of the mask was reasonably Fig . 9 . IR rs versus exposure duration and ACH in ( a ) buses , ( b ) subways , ( c ) high speed trains . Y . Feng et al . Building and Environment 242 ( 2023 ) 110489 11 assessed in this paper , according to the initial particle size distribution under actual respiratory activity and the leakage rate of the corre - sponding particle size . Based on the ratio of the particle ’ s volume inside and outside the mask and the assumption of the same viral concentration contained in different particle sizes [ 50 , 51 ] , modified mask filtration efficiencies ( TIL c and TOL c ) were applied . The fitting of masks to a person ’ s face also significantly affects the total particle leakage rate , and ultimately lowers the protective effect [ 62 ] . Wearing a mask for a long time tends to cause some physical symptoms [ 64 ] , which is often considered as an important influence on face fitting . To minimize discomfort [ 64 ] , found that wearing a mask for more than 2 h was not recommended . Subsequently , to reduce the thermal discomfort caused by masks , there is a high probability that passengers wear them irregularly , leaving their nose or mouth bare outside a mask . Unfortunately , passengers may even directly remove the mask , especially passengers with anxiety or asthma [ 65 ] . In addition , eating and drinking non - alcoholic beverages are permitted on high speed trains due to longer travel [ 66 ] . For buses and subways , eating is banned but drinking briefly is accepted , which is not strongly enforced and is mostly ignored . This suggests that the likelihood of removing masks is higher in high speed trains compared to buses and subways [ 67 ] . found that the particle filtration efficiency ( PFE ) and bacterial filtration efficiency ( BFE ) of the masks decreased as the actual wearing time increased . In this paper , we did not consider the influence of mask - wearing time on its PFE . It is assumed that the mask is newly used or the total duration of reuse is relatively short , and the filter structure is not damaged . Basic reproduction number ( R o ) may vary in infectious periods and different outbreaking regions [ 68 ] , which may affect the value of f . Based on the study by Ref . [ 43 ] ; ER q was obtained for three SARS - CoV - 2 variants by Ref . [ 68 ] . Furthermore , combining with the study by Ref . [ 25 ] ; the value of f ranges from 6 . 5 to 19 . 5 for Delta and 15 . 1 to 48 . 5 for Omicron . In this study , the f value of 10 . 8 for Delta ( R o = 6 . 2 ) and 30 . 1 for Omicron ( R o = 9 . 5 ) were used to provide an averaged input for the Monte Carlo simulations [ 25 ] . The influence of different values of R o ( e . g . , 5 . 1 or 8 . 0 for Delta , 7 . 2 or 12 for Omicron [ 68 ] ) on the infection risk was not analyzed currently . In the future , the infection risk of built environments can be obtained according to the actual R o in an urban or country . In addition to the virus species or different variants , other variables such as passenger density and ventilation also greatly affect the reproduction number . N 1 , N 2 , N rs , and the location of the index case varies from case to case . However , different occupancy conditions should also be attended , e . g . full seat condition , where the distribution characteristics of the crowd can be crucial for the particle transport [ 37 ] . The current TJWR model applied in the UPT does not address the im - plications of airflow patterns , which may normally be obtained with CFD tools . Opening windows randomly in the bus may affect the non - uniform mixing of virus - laden aerosols or droplets at the room scale . However , to simplify this uncertainty problem , we assume that the air is perfectly mixed for the room - scale . Moreover , the assumption of a deposition rate of 0 . 24 h (cid:0) 1 is likely invalid within the UPT compartment environment . The deposition rate is in theory size - dependent [ 46 ] but not treated in a size - resolved manner in this study . For full load conditions of the UPT , particles may also deposit more rapidly onto clothing and bare skin surfaces rather than solely on the floor . There is a compromise between Fig . 10 . The calculated total R with ( a ) the minimum exposure duration , ( b ) the maximum exposure duration , and ( c ) the average exposure duration . Y . Feng et al . Building and Environment 242 ( 2023 ) 110489 12 accuracy and efficiency for risk assessments in this study . The above limitations can be investigated in our future study . To simplify the problem , high - occupancy scenarios in UPT are cho - sen ( full load condition ) , and the passenger ’ s distribution is considered steady to evaluate the total R comprehensively . However , provided that a social distance of greater than 2 m is guaranteed or that masks are worn by all , ACH is subsequently adjusted according to the actual pas - senger number and location distribution . According to Fig . 8 ventilation is efficient evidence to reduce room - scale risks . However , Fig . 5 shows that ACH continuously fluctuates within an interval versus the exposure duration and is not stable . The impact of time - varying ACH on the risks was not analyzed , and only typical values of ACH considered to be stable were selected . In addition , it is challenging to increase ventilation , which needs significant investment in the ventilation system and addi - tional energy consumption [ 69 ] . Therefore , finding the optimal balance point between multi - scale infection risk and energy consumption can be crucial for transit operators of UPT [ 70 , 71 ] . The one - size - fits - all strategy cannot be adopted . According to the infection risks under different scenarios of UPT obtained from our simulations , the governors can guarantee that the UPT runs more efficiently , and develop appropriate energy - efficient strategies for the UPT . Moreover , based on the actual distribution of N 1 , N 2 , and N rs , respiratory parameters , ACH , and viral load data ( ER q ) , the individual ’ s infection risk can be detected in real - time . Spatial - scale based upper limit warnings at the multi - scale ( i . e . , N 1 , N 2 , and N event ) can be proposed to guide citizens to rationalize their duration and social distance . 5 . Conclusion The COVID - 19 pandemic poses significant challenges to the safety of the UPT environment worldwide . Based on field measurements in Hangzhou , China , during pandemic periods ( measured dates ranging from February to July 2021 ) , the average CO 2 concentration in the peak periods was 2 . 2 - folds and 1 . 3 - folds higher than in the off - peak periods Fig . 11 . IR rs versus exposure duration in typical scenarios , including index case - wearing scenario : ( a1 ) buses , ( b1 ) subways , ( c1 ) high speed trains , and both wearing scenario : ( a2 ) buses , ( b2 ) subways , ( c2 ) high speed trains . Y . Feng et al . Building and Environment 242 ( 2023 ) 110489 13 for buses and subways respectively . In high speed trains , the CO 2 con - centration exceeded 2000 ppm with an average value of 1298 ppm . According to the number of passengers , ACH was 9 h (cid:0) 1 for buses ( average , ranging from 2 h (cid:0) 1 to 20 h (cid:0) 1 ) , 16 h (cid:0) 1 for subways ( average , ranging from 8 h (cid:0) 1 to 22 h (cid:0) 1 ) , and 8 h (cid:0) 1 for high speed trains ( average , ranging from 4 h (cid:0) 1 to 11 h (cid:0) 1 ) . The proportion of poor ventilation was 75 % for buses , 83 % for subways , and 25 % for high speed trains , respectively . Infection risk thresholds at multi - scales ( i . e . , short - range 1 , 2 , and room - scale ) were obtained ( 7 . 1 % , 4 . 2 % , and 0 . 78 % for buses ; 6 . 3 % , 3 . 4 % , and 0 . 23 % for subways ; 25 . 0 % , 7 . 1 % , and 0 . 62 % for high speed railways ) . Similarly , based on the TJWR model , to obtain a guideline exposure duration , time - scale based exposure thresholds ( i . e . , ET and ET i ) were calculated for different scenarios . Results indicate that poor ventilation , the larger transmission enhancement coefficient ( f ) for SARS - CoV - 2 variants , and speaking all cause shorter ET values and a greater time interval for ET i . That is , in the UPT , being infected can occur within as little as 0 . 1 h . Enhancing ventilation has a limited effect on reducing average risks at the short - range of the UPT , only less than 10 % . By maintaining a social distance greater than 2 m , N 1 and N 2 can be reduced , thereby decreasing R cp 01 and R cp 12 . Based on the real - time compartment envi - ronments , spatial - scale based upper limit warnings of the multi - scale ( i . e . , N 1 , N 2 , and N event ) were obtained , which can be as guiding principles for transit operators to control occupancy rates . At the room - scale ( R rs ) , when increasing ACH , the average reduction level of the UPT can be more than 50 % . According to three typical exposure durations , different SARS - CoV - 2 variants , and actual values of ACH , the total R of buses and high speed trains were 0 . 8 - folds ( average , ranging from 0 . 5 to 1 . 0 - folds ) and 0 . 6 - folds ( average , ranging from 0 . 5 to 0 . 8 - folds ) lower than sub - ways , respectively , which indicates that the overall risk of subways is a cause for concern . Compared with increasing ACH , the average reduc - tion effect in buses , subways , and trains was 1 . 5 - folds , 1 . 9 - folds , and 2 . 0 - folds for the index case - wearing scenario . For the both - wearing scenario , the reduction effect was 3 . 6 - folds more than the index case - wearing scenario . Therefore , mask wearing provides the greatest protection against infection in the face of long exposure duration to the omicron epidemic .
