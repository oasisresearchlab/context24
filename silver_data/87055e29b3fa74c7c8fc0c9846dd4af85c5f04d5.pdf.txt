Kern ยง From the Laboratory of Cell Biology , NHLBZ and the $ Ihboratory of Biological Chemistry , Developmental Therapeutics Program , Division of Cancer Deatment , NCZ , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , Maryland 20892 Jasplakinolide , a naturally occurring cyclic peptide from the marine sponge , Jaspis johnstoni , has both fun - gicidal and antiproliferative activity . We now report that this peptide is a potent inducer of actin polymeri - zation in vitro . The peptide has a much greater effect on Me - actin than on Ca2 + - actin . Competitive binding stud - ies using rhodamine - phalloidin suggest that jasplakino - lide binds to F - actin competitively with phalloidin with a dissociation constant of approximately 15 MI . This compares favorably to the previously reported IC , of 35 MI for the antiproliferative effect of jasplakinolide on PC3 prostate carcinoma cells . The binding curve sug - gests that nearest neighbor positive cooperativity influ - ences the binding of jasplakinolide ( and perhaps also phalloidin ) to F - actin . These results imply that jas - plakinolide may exert its cytotoxic effect in vivo by in - ducing actin polymerization and / or stabilizing pre - ex - isting actin filaments . Jasplakinolide is a cyclic peptide with a 15 - carbon macrocy - clic ring containing three amino acid residues : L - alanine , N - methyl - 2 - bromotryptophan , and 0 - tyrosine ( 1 , 2 ) . The func - tion of the native molecule in the organism from which it is isolated , the marine sponge , Jaspis johnstoni , is unknown , but recent studies using purified jasplakinolide have demonstrated both fungicidal and antiproliferative activity ( 3 , 4 ) . In the cur - rent work , we show that jasplakinolide dramatically decreases the critical concentration of rabbit skeletal muscle actin and competes with rhodamine - phalloidin for F - actin . We suggest that jasplakinolide and phalloidin bind to F - actin by similar mechanisms . The pharmacologic and biochemical implications of these findings are discussed . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Materials - Rabbit skeletal muscle actin was prepared from frozen muscle ( Pel - Freez , Rogers , A R ) as previously described and stored in a * The costs of publication of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges .

Pyrenyl - labeled actin ' was prepared and found to contain 0 . 97 mol of labeVmol of protein using the method of Kouyama and Mihashi ( 6 ) . Both unla - beled and pyrenyl - labeled actins were further purified by gel filtration on Sephacryl HR - 300 ( Pharmacia Biotech ) . Jasplakinolide ( NSC 613009 ) was provided to the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch , NCI , by Dr . Phillip Crews ( University of California , Santa Cruz ) . Effect of Jasplakinolide on the Time Course of Actin Polymerization and Steady State Actin Concentration - Pyrenyl - labeled Ca2 + - actin ( 2 . 2 p ~ ) was converted to Mg2 " actin by the addition of 50 p ~ MgCl , and 125 PM EGTA . After 12 min , various concentrations of jasplakinolide were added and the time course of fluorescence change was monitored at an excitation wavelength of 366 nm and emission wavelength of 386 nm . Time - averaged fluorescence emission intensity was measured at 90 " from incident light with a Spex Fluorolog 212 spectrofluorimeter using 0 . 95 - ml samples . Photobleaching was minimized by use of a timed shut - ter . In one sample , jasplakinolide was added directly to pyrenyl - labeled Ca2 + - actin . At 24 h , the steady state fluorescence intensity was com - pared with the fraction of actin that pelleted in 30 min at 30 p . s . i . in an Airfuge ( Beckman Instruments ) . The concentration of F - actin was cal - culated as total actin minus the actin in the supernatant as determined by densitometry after sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel elec - trophoresis ( 7 ) . Competitive Binding between Rhodamine - Phalloidin and Jasplakinolide - Unlabeled Mgz ' - actin ( final concentration , 1 . 1 p ~ ) , prepared as for pyrenyl - labeled actin except that only 5 min was al - lowed for exchange of cation , was polymerized with MgCl , ( final con - centration , 2 m ) . In one series of experiments , 0 . 79 ) 1 ~ rhodamine - phalloidin was added to F - actin and allowed to equilibrate for 20 min before the addition of various concentrations of jasplakinolide . In a second series , jasplakinolide was added first , followed 20 min later by the addition of rhodamine - phalloidin . In both series of experiments , the fluorescence intensity was monitored with excitation at 550 nm and emission at 580 nm , and steady state values were obtained after 2 h . The increment in fluorescence caused by binding of rhodamine - phalloi - din to F - actin was determined in separate control experiments in which the fluorescence of 0 . 79 p ~ rhodamine - phalloidin was determined in the presence and absence of excess F - actin . With this information , the steady state fluorescence data for the experimental samples could be converted to the amount of rhodamine - phalloidin that was bound to F - actin ( 8 ) . Data were fit using an infinite linear lattice model with competition between binding sites to determine the dissociation constant of jas - plakinolide and F - actin ( Ki ) ( 9 ) . A Kg of 40 nM was assumed for the interaction between rhodamine - phalloidin and F - actin with stoichiom - etry of 1 : l ( 8 ) ( see Ref . 10 for alternative binding scheme ) . The critical concentration of actin was assumed to be zero in 0 . 79 PM phalloidin ( 11 ) . Using the conditional probability method of McGhee and von Hippel ( 121 , additional variation in the theoretical binding curve could be ex - plicitly determined for varying Kg and w , an interaction term describing the effect on the binding constant if a nearest neighbor along the one - start actin filament already has its jasplakinolide binding site occupied by jasplakinolide ( i . e . w = 1 if there is no effect on the nearest neighbors and w > 1 if nearest neighbor binding is influenced by positive cooper - ativity ) . RESULTS Time Course of Actin Polymerization and Steady State Con - centration of F - actin - Addition of 0 . 5 - 7 . 4 VM jasplakinolide in - creased the fluorescence of 2 . 2 PM pyrenyl - labeled Me - actin , indicative of polymerization , without any additional monova - lent or divalent cations , i . e . under nominally non - polymerizing conditions ( Fig . 1 ) . The rate of fluorescence increase was greater with increasing concentrations of drug . MI samples reached steady state fluorescence intensity by 24 h .

Time course of actin polymerization as monitored by fluorescence intensity . Data are shown for 0 . 5 ( O ) , 1 . 0 ( 01 , 2 . 2 ( 0 1 , and 7 . 4 ( + ) p ~ jasplakinolide with 2 . 2 PM pyrenyl - labeled Mg2 ' - actin , except for one sample with 2 . 2 p ~ jasplakinolide and 2 . 2 p ~ Ca2 + - actin ( A ) . The inset shows the steady state fluorescence intensity for the Mg2 + - actin samples after correlation of fluorescence intensity with F - actin concentration and the corresponding amounts of pelletable F - actin ( * I . All samples were in a " non - polymerizing " buffer containing 0 . 25 imidazole , 0 . 2 mMATP , 0 . 2 mm dithiothreitol , 0 . 1 mM CaCI , , and 0 . 01 % sodium azide , pH 7 . 8 . amount of pelletable actin correlated well with the fluorescence intensity and varied linearly with the jasplakinolide concentra - tion , at least until the molar stoichiometry of jasplakinolide to actin reached 1 : l ( Fig . 1 , inset ) . A sample of 2 . 2 p pyrenyl - labeled Ca2 + - actin and equimolar jasplakinolide increased in fluorescence much more slowly than the equivalent sample of Mg2 " actin and jasplakinolide ( Fig . 1 , compare triangles with diamonds ) . At steady state , 0 . 6 PM of the Caz + - actin had po - lymerized ( data not shown ) compared to l p ~ of Me - actin ( Fig . 1 , inset ) . Samples with only 5 % pyrenyl - labeled actin gave the same relative increases in fluorescence intensity as the samples with 100 % pyrenyl - labeled actin ( data not shown ) . To confirm that the increase in fluorescence intensity re - flected actin polymerization , samples were negatively stained with uranyl acetate and examined by electron microscopy . Nu - merous 9 - nm - wide filaments were present in the samples with jasplakinolide , and their appearance was indistinguishable from that of filaments polymerized in 2 mM MgC1 , in the ab - sence of jasplakinolide . Filaments were not present in actin samples to which neither jasplakinolide nor MgC1 , had been added ( data not shown ) . Actin filaments made by the addition of equimolar jas - plakinolide were resistant to depolymerization . After dilution of these filaments into buffer G to a concentration of 100 nM ( from a 10 PM stock solution of pyrenyl - labeled Me - F - actin ) , the fluorescence intensity decreased < 2 % in 60 s and 4 % after 5 min . A control sample of pyrenyl - labeled Mg2 " F - actin ( in 2 . 0 mM MgCl , ) diluted in the same manner had a 65 % decrease in fluorescence intensity in the first 60 s and was completely depolymerized after 5 min . Competitive Binding Study - Control samples demonstrated that binding of rhodamine - phalloidin to rabbit muscle actin resulted in a 15 . 4 - fold increase in fluorescence intensity . In - creasing concentrations of jasplakinolide decreased the fluores - cence intensity observed at a fixed concentration of F - actin ( 1 . 1 p ~ ) and rhodamine - phalloidin ( 0 . 79 p ~ ) ( Fig . 2 ) . The order of addition of rhodamine - phalloidin and jasplakinolide had no ef - fect on the results , suggesting that the decrease in fluorescence was due to an equilibrium reaction . Assuming a Kg of 40 nM for the interaction of rhodamine - phalloidin with F - actin , the best fit to a simple competitive binding model was obtained with K i ( the dissociation constant of jasplakinolide from F - actin ) Josploklrlol , de ( pM ) FIG . 2 . Competitive binding of jasplakinolide and rhodamine - phalloidin for F - actin . All samples contained 1 . 1 p ~ M $ ' - F - actin , 0 . 79 PM rhodamine - phalloidin , and jasplakinolide at the indicated con - centrations in the same buffer as in Fig . 1 plus 2 m ~ MgCl , . Samples to which rhodamine - phalloidin was added first are shown by circles ; samples to which jasplakinolide was added first are shown by squares . The solid curve represents the best fit for competitive binding with K ; = 15 nM . The dashed curve shows that a better fit can be obtained when nearest neighbor cooperativity , w , is 10 and Kg is 300 nM . equal to 15 nM ( Fig . 2 , solid line ) . This value compares favor - ably to the IC , , of 35 nM for PC3 prostate carcinoma cells ( 4 ) . A better fit to the data could be obtained by assuming that jas - plakinolide interacts with the nearest neighbor binding sites to increase their affinity for jasplakinolide ( Fig . 2 , dashed line ) . The earliest portions of the binding curve ( jasplakinolide COR - centration < 1 PM ) could be fit only by a still more complicated model in which rhodamine - phalloidin also exerted nearest neighbor positive cooperativity for the binding of additional rhodamine - phalloidin ( theoretical curve not shown ) . To determine whether the loss of rhodamine fluorescence in the presence of jasplakinolide was , in fact , due to competitive binding rather than , for example , quenching of fluorescence , rhodamine - phalloidin - labeled F - actin was pelleted from solu - tions containing 0 . 2 and 2 . 0 PM jasplakinolide . Only the pellet from the solution containing 0 . 2 PM jasplakinolide was darkly colored ( from the bound rhodamine - phalloidin ) . When unla - beled F - actin was added to the supernatant of the solution originally containing 2 . 0 p ~ jasplakinolide , the fluorescence intensity increased to approximately 50 % of the original fluo - rescence in the absence of jasplakinolide . Addition of F - actin to the supernatant of the solution originally containing 0 . 2 p jasplakinolide resulted in no significant fluorescence change ( data not shown ) . These results indicate that the higher con - centration of jasplakinolide competitively removed rhodamine - phalloidin from the F - actin so that rhodamine - phalloidin was available to bind to a fresh aliquot of F - actin . DISCUSSION The bicyclic phalloidin peptides were first isolated in 1937 ( 13 ) . Other than the chemically similar virotoxins ( both phal - loidin and the virotoxins are heptapeptides isolated from poi - sonous Amanita mushrooms ) , no other chemicals have been previously shown to stabilize actin filaments . The identifica - tion ofjasplakinolide as a drug that binds F - actin competitively with phalloidin may provide insight regarding the mechanism by which cyclic peptides bind to actin , and subsequently , per - haps explain why these peptides stabilize actin filaments . Chemically , the 15 - carbon macrocyclic ring of jasplakinolide bears little resemblance to that of the virotoxins or phalloidin except for the presence of an L - alanine residue followed by N - methyl - 2 - ( bromo ) - ~ - tryptophan in jasplakinolide compared with alanine followed by 2 - ( methylsulfonyl ) - ~ - tryptophan ( viro - toxin ) or L - tryptophan linked to cysteine by a sulfide bridge Jasplakinolide Stabilizes F - actin 14871 ( phalloidin ) ( 1 , 2 , 14 ) . The hydroxyl groups in the peptide resi - dues preceding alanine that are critical for virotoxin and phal - loidin activity ( 15 ) are absent from jasplakinolide . Although phalloidin and jasplakinolide have similar affini - ties for F - actin , jasplakinolide seems to stabilize filaments more effectively . For example , the results reported in Estes et al . ( 16 ) imply that Ca2 + - actin in 100 1 . 1 ~ phalloidin ( l : l , actin to phalloidin ) has an apparent critical concentration of more than 50 VM , whereas we estimate a critical concentration of 1 . 6 1 . 1 ~ for 2 . 2 p ~ Ca2 + - actin in the presence of equimolar jasplakinol - ide . Although the much greater effect of jasplakinolide on Mg2 " actin than on Ca2 + - actin has not been reported for phalloidin , it might be predicted from the suggestion of Estes et al . ( 16 ) that phalloidin stabilizes F - actin by decreasing the rate of dissocia - tion of actin oligomers . As the nucleation rate of Mgz + - actin is faster than that of Ca2 + - actin and the elongation rates are simi - lar ( 173 , phalloidin would be expected to enhance the rates of polymerization of Mg2 + - actin and Ca2 ' - actin in proportion to their relative nucleation rates . An alternative explanation de - rives from the fact that phalloidin inhibits the dissociation of Pi from F - actin , but not the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP - Pi on F - actin ( 18 ) . Because the ratio of the dissociation rate of ADP - actin subunits to that of ADP - Pi - actin subunits is lower for Mg2 " actin than for Ca2 + - actin ( 17 ) , the prevention of loss of Pi would be expected to have a greater effect on Mg2 " actin than Ca2 + - actin . These various possibilities can be tested by quantitative evaluation of nucleation and elongation rate constants in the presence of phalloidin and jasplakinolide . The pharmacologic usefulness of phalloidin and virotoxin has been extremely limited because , in general , cells ( both in cul - ture and in vivo ) are impermeable , and therefore insensitive to them ( 19 , 20 ) . Hepatocytes are an unfortunate exception in which uptake is mediated by a membrane - bound bile acid - transporter resulting in severe hepatotoxicity ( 21 ) . Jasplakino - lide , in contrast to phalloidin and virotoxins , has demonstrated cytotoxicity to a number of tumor - derived cell lines , including breast and prostatic cancers ( 3 , 4 ) . Previous studies ( 4 ) demonstrated that exposure of living cells to jasplakinolide markedly altered the distribution of rho - damine - phalloidin ( a specific label for filamentous actin ) ap - plied after fixation and permeabilization . Since the current results show that phalloidin and jasplakinolide interact com - petitively , further studies are necessary to clarify the ultra - structural basis for the change in cellular distribution of actin label . Nevertheless , the present experiments identify F - actin as a molecular target for jasplakinolide . ( The increased perme - ability of cells to jasplakinolide relative to phalloidin suggests that fluorescent derivatives of jasplakinolide may prove to be a valuable tool for the study of the distribution of actin in cells that have not been subjected to harsh permeabilization proce - dures . ) In summary , although a number of chemotherapeutic agents have activities directed at the microtubule - based cy - toskeleton , the results reported in this paper suggest that jas - plakinolide may be a useful pharmacologic agent by virtue of its ability to induce actin polymerization and inhibit the depo - lymerization of actin filaments .
