Jtm . 5 R ÉSUMÉ L’endocytose dépendante de la clathrine ( EDC ) est un processus fondamental des cellules eucaryotes . Elle se caractérise par la formation d’invaginations à la membrane plasmique aboutissant à la création de petites vésicules par l’action de la dynamine . Dans le cerveau , elle est impliquée dans la dépression synaptique à long terme , un corrélat cellulaire de la mémoire . La morphologie complexe des neurones et le contrôle précis du code neuronal suggèrent qu’elle puisse être régulée spatialement et temporellement dans ces cellules . Le but de mon travail a été de développer de nouveaux outils pour visualiser et perturber l’EDC afin d’étudier ce type de régulation . Le premier de ces outils est pHuji , un senseur de pH rouge génétiquement encodable . Je l’ai utilisé avec un senseur de pH vert existant pour montrer que dans les cellules NIH - 3T3 , le récepteur β2 - adrénergique est internalisé dans une sous - population de vésicules contenant le récepteur à la transferrine constitutivement endocyté . Le deuxième est une nouvelle méthode d’imagerie permettant de visualiser l’activité d’endocytose de structures recouvertes de clathrine optiquement stables dans des neurones d’hippocampe . J’ai ainsi pu suivre pour la première fois la cinétique d’internalisation de récepteurs au glutamate de type AMPA dans des conditions de plasticité . Enfin , j ' ai élaboré un test combinant imagerie et patch - clamp afin de développer un bloqueur peptidique spécifique de l ' EDC . En utilisant des peptides dimériques , j’ai montré que la dynamine se lie à ses partenaires via des interactions multimériques . En conclusion , ce travail propose une boite à outils permettant d’élucider les mécanismes de l’EDC avec une grande résolution spatiale et temporelle . Mots - clés : Endocytose dépendante de la clathrine , dynamine , récepteur à la transferrine , récepteur Beta2 adrénergique , protéines fluorescentes , récepteur AMPA , dépression synaptique à long terme , photoactivation , interactions protéine - protéine , peptides multivalents . 6 A BSTRACT Clathrin mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is a fundamental process of all eukaryotic cells . At the level of the plasma membrane , it is characterised by the formation of deep invaginations resulting in the creation of small vesicles after membrane scission by dynamin . In the central nervous system , it is involved in the expression of synaptic long term depression , a proposed cellular correlate of learning and memory . The complex morphology of neurons and the precise timing of neuronal firing suggest that endocytosis may be spatially and temporally regulated in those cells . The aim of the work presented here was to develop new tools to visualise and perturb CME in order to study such regulation . The first tool to be characterised was pHuji , a genetically encoded red pH - sensor . I used it in combination with an existing green pH - sensor to demonstrate that in NIH - 3T3 cells , the β2 - adrenergic receptor was internalised in a subset of vesicles containing the constitutively endocytosed transferrin receptor . The second tool is a new imaging method that allowed me to monitor the endocytic activity of optically stable clathrin coated structures in hippocampal neurons . I was thus able to visualise for the first time the kinetics of internalisation of AMPA - type glutamate receptors under plasticity inducing conditions . Finally , I set up an assay combining imaging and cell dialysis in order to develop a specific peptide - based inhibitor of CME . Using dimeric peptides , I found that the interplay between dynamin and its binding partners relies on multimeric interactions . Altogether , this work provides a toolbox to decipher the mechanisms of vesicle formation with high spatial and temporal resolution . Keywords : Clathrin mediated endocytosis , dynamin , Transferrin Receptor , Beta2 adrenergic receptor , fluorescents proteins , AMPA receptor , long - term synaptic depression , photoactivation , protein - protein interactions , multivalent peptides . 7 P UBLICATIONS A ND C OMMUNICATIONS Publications Published : Shen Y . 1 , Rosendale M . 1 , Campbell R .

Investigators can answer increasingly detailed and complex questions as new methodologies are made accessible to them , just as much as they drive the development of ever more advanced techniques by perpetually taking up more demanding challenges . Neuroscience is one of those fields which illustrates this stimulating feed - forward phenomenon best . The brain , the cells that constitute it and the contacts made between them are so small , yet so highly organised , that we continuously need to seek new ways to look at them , monitor them , perturb and even control them if we one day hope to understand their function . Biologists , chemists , physiologists and many others all contribute to this goal , and the present thesis is but one of the many efforts made towards it . The work presented in the following pages was performed in the Interdisciplinary Institute for Neuroscience , in the team of Dr . Daniel Choquet " Dynamic Organization and Function of Synapses " , under the supervision of Dr . David Perrais . It will deal with understanding the spatial and temporal molecular dynamics of endocytosis while focusing on the development of new tools to help with this understanding . This work will be defended in a public oral communication in front of Dr . Nathalie Sans ( Neurocentre Magendie , INSERM U862 , Bordeaux University , France ) , Pr . Aurélien Roux ( NCCR Chemical - Biology and Biochemistry Department , University of Geneva , Switzerland ) , Pr . Volker Haucke ( Leibniz Institute for Molecular Pharmacology and Freie University Berlin , Germany ) and Pr . Britta Qualmann ( Institute for Biochemistry I at the University Hospital , Friedrich Schiller University Jena , Germany ) . The introduction will aim at presenting key notions and concepts about endocytosis in general and in neurons : what is known about it from a mechanistic point of view , what roles does it play in maintaining and shaping synaptic transmission and finally what tools have been used so far to study it . I will then provide a detailed description of the methodologies I have used and developed in order to visualise and perturb endocytosis with high spatial and temporal resolution . The results of my work will be presented in the shape of three scientific communication articles and one article abstract . The first article has been published in the Journal of Cell Biology in 2014 . It has been written in collaboration with the group of R . E . Campbell ( University of Alberta , Canada ) and characterises a new red pH - sensor 23 that enables dual - colour imaging of receptor endocytosis . The second article is in preparation . It describes a novel imaging method that detects the dynamics of endocytic vesicle formation in neurons . The third article , also in preparation , was written in collaboration with chemists of our institute . It reports on the ongoing development of a photoactivatable inhibitor of endocytosis . The fourth article will be shortly presented as a summary , illustrated by one figure . It introduces a collaborative work , undertaken with the group of A . Echard ( Institut Pasteur , Paris ) , that uses imaging to characterise the role of Rab35 in recruiting OCRL on nascent endocytic vesicles . Finally , I will provide an extended discussion on the advantages and limitations of the tools and protocols I developed as well as propose some perspectives for the continuation of the project based on the obtained results . 24 25 Introduction Visualising endocytosis unambiguously is a challenging task , and perturbing it is a necesary one for a deeper understanding of its regulation . When combined with the intrinsic complexity of neurons , it becomes an exciting field of study . In this introduction , I shall first provide a description of the molecular mechanisms regulating clathrin mediated endocytosis and an overview of the general principles of neurotransmission . I will then combine these two bodies of knowledge to describe the functional roles of endocytosis in shaping neuronal communication as well as provide technical insights on the existing methods to study it , insisting on their advantages and limitations . E NDOCYTOSIS – O R H OW C ELLS G ET T HEIR O UTSIDE I N A . One step of a complex machinery Endocytosis is a universal feature of all eukaryotic cells . Literally meaning getting inside ( “endo” ) the cell ( “cyto” ) , the term was coined by Christian deDuve during a symposium entitled “The Lysosome” in 1963 . Nowadays , it refers to the process by which a substance , proteins , lipids as well as components in suspension or solubilised in the extracellular fluid , gains entry inside the cell by being engulfed in a membrane surrounded vesicle . This mechanism is to be opposed to processes allowing substances to pass directly through the membrane by diffusion or with the help of transporters or channels . The formation and packaging of these vesicles , their transport throughout the cell interior , their fusion with other cellular compartments , their recycling to the cell exterior and their degradation are all part of a complex phenomenon known as membrane trafficking ( Figure 1 ) . Introduction 26 Figure 1 : Major vesicular membrane trafficking pathways Vesicular trafficking occurs at various cellular compartments : between the Endoplamic Reticulum ( ER ) and the Golgi for protein synthesis and maturation as well as lipid biogenesis ; from the Golgi to endosomes as well as directly to the plasma membrane for protein sorting and localisation ; from recycling endosomes to the plama membrane for recycling and exocytosis ; and from the plasma membrane to early endosomes and lysosomes for sorting , recycling and degradation . Some vesicles require coat proteins such as COPI , COPII , caveolin or clathrin for their formation whereas others seem to be able to protrude or invaginate without the need for such a scaffold . Pathogens such as bacteria or viruses are capable of hijacking some of these entry routes . Source : ( De Matteis and Luini , 2011 ) Endocytosis is a major step in this grand machinery that ranges from the budding of vesicles from the plasma membrane to the processing if these vesicle inside the cell as they are being transported to their final destination . It controls the biochemical composition of a cell’s outer plasma membrane and serves a multipurpose role to regulate complex , yet vital , cellular processes such as nutrient uptake , cell adhesion , cell migration , cell polarity , cytokinesis ( splitting of a mother cell into two daughter cells ) , biochemical signalling and neurotransmission . A . 1 . Membrane trafficking : Overview and definitions The plasma membrane ( PM ) is a lipidic bilayer that forms the boundary that defines the intracellular and extracellular compartments of a cell . It is composed of phospholipids , a subcategory of which , known as phosphoinositides ( PIs ) , is particularly important in regulating membrane trafficking events . Many proteins are embedded in the PM and ensure proper communication between the cell and its exterior . Within the cell , many other membrane bound compartments , or organelles , co - exist : the nucleus is the site of gene transcription and controls the cell cycle by which cells divide . The nuclear membrane is continuous with the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) . Once proteins are synthesised through gene E NDOCYTOSIS - O R H OW C ELLS G ET T HEIR O UTSIDE I N 27 transcription , they fold in the ER . Folded proteins can either be secreted as such or proceed to the Golgi apparatus via COPII ( coat protein complex II ) coated vesicles where they will be further modified by post - translational modifications including glycosylation and phosphorylation . Modified proteins as well as lipids are then transported via COPI coated vesicles to the transgolgi network ( TGN ) where they will be packaged into different vesicles according to their destination : some will go to lysosomes ( or late endosomes ) to ensure the acidic environment and the presence of hydrolytic enzymes in this compartment specialised in protein degradation ; others will directly reach the PM to be secreted on demand upon stimulation via exocytosis ; some are constitutively trafficked to the cell surface where they will be exocytosed and let the proteins and lipids they contained diffuse in the bulk of the PM ; and finally , some will be trafficked to early endosomes which constitute sorting platforms that can decide the fate of proteins . These early endosomes are also an intermediate step of the inverse route , when proteins , lipids and other cargo molecules go from the outside to the inside of the cell via endocytosis . Proteins and lipids contained in early endosomes will then be packaged again , either to reach lysosomes for degradation or to be sent to recycling endosomes that will bring them back to the PM for a new cycle . A . 2 . Membrane trafficking markers and regulators The various membrane delineated subcellular organelles display identity markers that are believed to both help with their function as well as coordinate the communication and routing of vesicles trafficking from one organelle to another . These markers consist of lipids and proteins known as phosphoinositides ( PIs ) and Rab GTPases . PIs result from the phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol , a type of amphiphatic lipid which polar head is composed of an inositol that can be phosphorylated at positions 3 , 4 and / or 5 . The family of PIs thus includes the following lipids : PI ( 3 ) P , PI ( 4 ) P , PI ( 5 ) P , PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 , PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . The different subcellular membrane compartments are differentially enriched in the various PIs . This is believed to play an important role in targeting regulatory proteins to the right compartment using lipid recognition domains ( Figure 2 ) . PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is particularly important in regulating endocytosis and signalling cascades . It is thereby often simply referred to as PIP 2 . It can be cleaved into the signalling molecules IP 3 and diacyglycerol by the activity of the phospholipase PLCγ . It is also the substrate of kinases and phosphatases that regulate its phosphorylation state . Its biosynthesis from PI ( 4 ) P is thus ensured by the 5’ - kinases PIP5Kα , β and γ . Conversly , its turnover into PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 or PI ( 4 ) P is achieved by the 3’ - kinase PI3K and the 5’ - phophatases SHIP2 , synaptojanin or OCRL respectively ( Antonescu et al . , 2011 ) . As illustrated in Figure 2 , PIP 2 is particularly enriched at the plasma membrane but early and recycling endosomes are predominantly composed of PI ( 3 ) P . The turnover of PIP 2 into PI ( 3 ) P is therefore necessary for newly internalised vesicles to fuse with early endosomes . It has been Introduction 28 proposed that the formation of PI ( 3 ) P from PIP 2 relied on the formation PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 as an intermediate species via the action PI ( 3 ) K C2α ( Posor et al . , 2013 ) . The 4 ' - phosphatase ( s ) that would then lead to PI ( 3 ) P is ( are ) however currently unknown . Interestingly , the 4 ' - phosphatase Sac2 / INPP5F , has recently been identified on endosomes but in vitro assays suggest that it specifically dephosphorylates PI ( 4 ) P over other PIs , including PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ( Nakatsu et al . , 2015 ) . Figure 2 : Lipid composition of membrane compartments and lipid recognition domains ( A ) Subcellular localisation of various PIs . The plasma membrane is mostly enriched in PIP 2 while early endosomes ( EE ) are mostly enriched in PI ( 3 ) P . ( B ) Many proteins involved in membrane trafficking ( coloured ellipses ) exhibit lipid recognition domains . Some of these domains recognise all PIs such as PH and PX domains . Others are specific of a given PI such as the ANTH and ENTH domains for PIP 2 or the FYVE domain for PI ( 3 ) P . PIs are represented with hexagonal headgroups phosphorylated at positions 3 , 4 and / or 5 ( circles ) . Source : adapted from ( Kutateladze , 2010 ) Rab GTPases form a large family of 60 to 70 molecular switches cycling from a GTP bound state to a GDP bound state . Each Rab is specific for a subcellular compartment and can even define membrane microdoamains within a given compartment ( Figure 3 ) . They therefore play an essential role in spatially and temporally controlling the recruitment of functionally active molecules to their due site of action . The switch from GDP - to GTP - bound state is catalysed by a guanine exchange factor ( GEF ) while the switch from GTP - to GDP - bound state occurs upon hydrolysis of the GTP nucleotide and is regulated by a GTPase - activating protein ( GAP ) . Rab proteins undergo major conformational rearrangements upon binding to GTP which confers them the ability to recruit a variety of effectors . Rab effectors have been implicated in all aspects of membrane trafficking such as vesicle budding , vesicle uncoating , vesicle motility and vesicle fusion ( Stenmark , 2009 ) . Interestingly , Rab GTPases could also be implicated in defining the lipidic identity of the membranes they are bound to by recruiting PI kinases or phosphatases as effectors . Recently , Rab GTPases have also been proposed to directly interact with endocytic cargo molecules , thereby controlling their E NDOCYTOSIS - O R H OW C ELLS G ET T HEIR O UTSIDE I N 29 fate in being routed towards recycling or degradation pathways for example ( Aloisi and Bucci , 2013 ) . Figure 3 : Subcellular localisation of Rab GTPases The family of Rab GTPases specifies the identity of intracellular organelles . They are involved in routing vesicles from one compartment to another by recruiting effectors to their correct subcellular localisation . For example Rab 1 and 2 regulate ER to Golgi trafficking . Rab 8 is localised at the TGN and regulates direct exocytosis . Rab 5 is found in newly formed endocytic vesicles and in early endosomes together with Rab 4 which in turn is responsible for rapid recycling to the PM . Rab 11 and 35 on the other hand are found on recycling endosomes and regulate the slow recycling . Rab 15 regulates the trafficking from early to recycling endosomes whereas Rab 7 and 9 are found on late endosomes and may regulate the maturation from late endosome to lysosome . Source : ( Stenmark , 2009 ) A . 3 . Endocytosis in membrane trafficking Strictly speaking , endocytosis refers to the whole process through which solute , proteins and lipids , together referred to as cargo , are internalised and then fuse with an endosome that will either mature into a lysosome or will reach a recycling endosome . Many endocytic pathways co - exist within a cell . Their internalisation mechanisms vary a great deal and require the involvement of various molecular players . However , many features of these pathways overlap and they all lead to the eventual fusion of the newly formed vesicle with an early endosome . Why cells would use a great variety of entry mechanisms to finally merge all the vesicular contents in the same structure is currently poorly understood . Whether the endosomal population within a given cell is actually heterogeneous or whether endosomes display a nanoscale organisation such that , as vesicles coming from different routes fuse with them , they retain this information into subdomains for future sorting remains largely unknown . Introduction 30 It should also be noted , and it will often be the case in this manuscript , that the word " endocytosis " is quite commonly used to solely refer to the internalisation step , when vesicles are being formed : how cargo is selected at the level of the PM , which mechanisms enable membrane invagination and finally how membrane fission is achieved are complex enough questions to deserve a whole field of study of their own , however fascinating the fate of these vesicles is . The best studied form of endocytosis is known as clathrin mediated endocytosis ( CME ) . It is characterised by the packaging of membrane and proteinacious components into small vesicles coated with clathrin proteins . The mechanisms regulating the internalisation step of this endocytic pathway involve many accessory proteins and will be the main focus of the present study . However , clathrin independent forms of endocytosis have increasingly drawn the attention of the cell biologist community and will be briefly described in the following section . B . The various modes of endocytosis Figure 4 : Multiple internalisation routes at the plasma membrane Phagocytosis specialises in the uptake of large particles such as bacteria or debris whereas pinocytosis originally refers to fluid phase uptake . However , most of the mechanisms not only internalise purely extracellular components such as nutrients and enzymes but also enable the internalisation of membrane bound proteins and membrane lipids . The various forms of endocytosis are defined by their molecular machinery and characterised by the nature of their cargo and the size of the vesicles formed . Source : ( Mayor and Pagano , 2007 ) E NDOCYTOSIS - O R H OW C ELLS G ET T HEIR O UTSIDE I N 31 B . 1 . Phagocytosis Phagocytosis refers to the process of engulfing large solid particles into the cell interior . It is a major mechanism used by cells of the immune system ( macrophages in the body and microglia in the nervous system ) to clear cell debris and pathogens such as post - apoptotic cells , bacteria or viruses . The internalised particle ends up in a phagolysosome , a transient compartment containing lytic enzymes and reactive oxygen species that will degrade the particle before disappearing ( Nüsse , 2011 ) . The first step in phagocytosis is target recognition , a process mediated by antigen receptors present at the cell surface . Then internalisation occurs as the membrane protrudes into a phagocytic cup by the action of the actin cytoskeleton with the help of actin modulators such as WASP and the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Rougerie et al . , 2013 ) . The activity of dynamin , a large GTPase that will be extensively discussed later in this manuscript , is believed to mediate the fission reaction leading to the creation of the phagosome ( Gold et al . , 1999 ) . B . 2 . Macropinocytosis Macropinocytosis is one of those confounding processes that can be readily observed but lack features to specifically describe them . It consists in the protrusion of plasma membrane into the extracellular space that leads to fluid phase uptake into a macropinosome upon closure . However , at the molecular level , it is rather characterised by what doesn ' t regulate it than by what does . It indeed does not exhibit any cargo specificity , the macropinosome is devoid of coat proteins and the mechanism for membrane closure is currently unknown . Nonetheless , macropinocytosis is known to be greatly enhanced by the presence of growth factors in the extracellular medium and shares many common features with phagocytosis such as the requirement for actin and actin regulators as well as the importance of the lipid PI ( 3 ) P ( Jones , 2007 ) . The non specificity of macropinocytosis makes it a favourite entry route for several pathogens including viruses ( Mercer and Helenius , 2009 ) . Together , endocytic pathways that are neither phagocytosis nor macropinocytosis form a functional category known as micropinocytosis . They are characterised by smaller , stereotypical vesicles ( ~ 100 nm compared to the one or more micron big phagosomes and macropinosomes ) that form by membrane invagination rather than membrane protrusion . After their formation , these vesicles converge to fuse with sorting endosomal compartments . Micropinocytosis can be categorised by the molecular players involved in the internalisation step , especially according to whether or not vesicle formation requires the presence of a coat protein . Introduction 32 B . 3 . Clathrin and caveolin independent pathways Some poorly understood pathways are known to occur in cells because they allow internalisation of certain cargos without depending on canonical entry routes . The best studied of those pathways is the CLIC - GEEC pathway , initially identified as the entry route for the cholera toxin ( Kirkham et al . , 2005 ) . Vesicles forming through this pathway converge to intracellular compartments concentrated in GPI - anchored proteins ( GPI - APs ) . For lack of other candidate molecular players , this endocytic pathway is thus best described as forming CLathrin - Independent Compartments ( CLIC ) that fuse to GPI - AP - enriched Early Endosomal Compartments ( GEECs ) . Because of the lack of a rigid spherical coat around the invaginating membrane , tubular structures are observed when this pathway is being studied . They do not appear to require coat proteins and the involvement of dynamin in membrane fission is either unclear or unknown ( Doherty and McMahon , 2009 ) . Other clathrin and caveolin independent pathways include the Arf6 dependent pathway and the flotilin dependent pathway which enable the internalisation of MHC class I proteins ( involved in the immune system ) and of proteoglycans ( components of the extracellular matrix ) respectively ( Mayor and Pagano , 2007 ; Doherty and McMahon , 2009 ) . Intrestingly , these forms of endocytosis could be initiated by invaginations induced by extracellular factors , such as pathogens like Shiga toxin B ( Römer et al . , 2007 ) or SV40 virus ( Ewers et al . , 2010 ) , and endogenous lectins ( Lakshminarayan et al . , 2014 ) , which further increases the complexity of defining these pathways . Moreover , a novel endocytic pathway , reported under the name FEME , standing for fast endophilin mediated endocytosis , has been recently described as forming endophilin coated tubular invaginations . It appears to be responsible for the internalisation of classical clathrin independent cargos such as activated β1 - adrenergic receptors , interleukin - 2 receptors and cholera toxin , on a timescale of a few seconds ( Boucrot et al , 2014 ) . B . 4 . Caveolin dependant endocytosis Caveolae are small 60 - 80 nm wide flask - shaped invaginations found at the PM of all cell types but red and white blood cells and neurons , and are particularly numerous in muscle cells . They are coated by oligomerised caveolins and cavin complexes and are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids . Caveolae are preassembled at the level of the Golgi , where they are already coated with caveolin . As they are trafficked to the PM , they are stabilised by cavins and probably adopt their final shape by interacting with PACSIN , aka syndapin , a curvature sensing molecule . Caveolae are quite stable structures but can be disrupted by cholesterol depletion due to disruption of the caveolin / cavin interaction ( Parton and del Pozo , 2013 ) . For many years , caveolae have been described as a constitutive endocytic route for various cargos such as palmitoylated G - Protein Coupled Receptors ( GPCRs ) ( Patel et al . , 2008 ) , ubiquitylated epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) and GPI - APs , highlighting a strong overlap between this pathway and the CLIC / GEEC pathway ( Mayor and Pagano , E NDOCYTOSIS - O R H OW C ELLS G ET T HEIR O UTSIDE I N 33 2007 ) . However , inconsistent results and recent advances in the understanding of caveolae have brittled this belief . Caveolae are now sometimes viewed as mechanosensors , capable of flattening out when mechanical stress is inflicted to the PM , thereby regulating membrane tension . They do undergo dynamin dependant endocytosis but either retain their identity and recycle back to the PM by exocytosis without dissociating or are targeted to late endosomes for degradation . This feature is different from clathrin mediated endocytosis , described below , where coat components as well as vesicular identity upon fusion with early endosomes are rapidly lost . This intriguing stability of caveolae has therefore been proposed to play a key role in intracellular signalling by spatial segregation . By regulating the localisation of signalling receptors into cholesterol and sphingolipid rich microdomains , called lipid rafts at the PM , endocytosis of caveolae may play a role in modulating their activity ( Parton and del Pozo , 2013 ) . B . 5 . Clathrin mediated endocytosis Clathrin mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is by far the most studied and best understood endocytic pathway . A recent , and rather audacious , study even claims that it represents the only endocytic pathway used by the cells for cargo internalisation purposes under normal conditions ( Bitsikas et al . , 2014 ) . It is a fundamental endocytic pathway which regulatory mechanisms are greatly conserved throughout eukaryotes , from yeast to mammals . The first observation of such internalisation from the PM dates back to the 1960 ' s , with a study of ferritin uptake ( Rosenbluth and Wissig , 1964 ) . It was originally called receptor mediated endocytosis but this term was abandoned as more and more receptors were found to be internalised via clathrin independent routes . Clathrin coated pits ( CCPs ) assemble at the plasma membrane which then invaginates to form clathrin coated vesicles ( CCVs ) of sizes ranging from 80 nm in the brain to 150 nm in other mammalian cells . This pathway is known to be responsible for the internalisation of a variety of signalling receptors , such as GPCRs and growth factor receptors , ion channels , such as aquaporins and AMPA receptors , and other transmembrane proteins such as integrins and tyrosin receptor kinases . It is also specifically implicated in the internalisation of the transferrin receptor ( TfR ) , making the latter a good marker for studying CME . Being involved in so many cellular functions , CME is unsurprisingly highly regulated by a myriad of molecular interactors . These include adaptor proteins ( e . g . AP - 2 , AP - 180 , β - arrestin ) which in combination with clathrin form the coat around the vesicle , and clathrin - coat associated sorting proteins ( CLASPs ) which help with specific cargo selection and pathway directionality ( Traub , 2009 ) . Molecular mechanisms inducing the subsequent invagination of the CCP are still poorly understood but are known to involve the recruitment of BIN - Amphiphysin - Rvs167 ( BAR ) domain containing proteins . Dimers of such proteins form banana shaped structures believed to sense and / or induce curvature onto the membrane they bind to ( Qualmann et al . , 2011 ) . As for the final scission of the vesicle from the membrane , there is no controversy about the necessary requirement of dynamin ( Robinson , 1994 ; Roux Introduction 34 et al . , 2006 ) . The involvement of actin in late stages of yeast CME is widely accepted but although it has consistently been observed right after membrane scission , its necessity in mammalian cells is still being debated ( Boulant et al . , 2011 ) . PIP 2 is then turned into PI ( 3 ) P and vesicles are being uncoated before fusing with early endosomes . Being the main interest of the present study , the mechanisms regulating CME will be described in much further detail in section D . of this chapter . However , in order to emphasise the vital importance of this pathway , focus will first be given to the many cellular functions in which it is involved . C . Functional roles of endocytosis The descriptions made in the following paragraphs are meant as an overview , and the , probably non exhaustive , listing of functional roles briefly presented here was inspired from two reviews ( McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ) and ( Gould and Lippincott - Schwartz , 2009 ) . Each of them are described in great detail in dedicated reference works , with their own regulatory mechanisms and their specific molecular modulators . Most examples cited here are taken from mammalian endocytosis , even though vast amounts of work performed in yeast or other model organisms could illustrate the same concepts . C . 1 . Endocytosis and nutrient uptake Endocytosis primarily refers to fluid phase uptake . The extra cellular fluid contains many nutrients , e . g . amino - acids , ATP , growth factors and oxygen , as well as metabolites , such as cholesterol and iron , important for cell function . Nutrient depletion is known to induce phagocytosis mediated autophagy , i . e . regulated cell death ( Russell et al . , 2014 ) . CME of receptors involved in sensing those factors can occur in two different ways : constitutively or upon stimulation . TfR for example is constitutively endocytosed , meaning that it does not have to be bound by its ligand transferrin ( Tfn , an iron binding protein ) to be internalised . On the other hand , EGFR dimerises upon ligand binding and this step is necessary for its binding to AP - 2 and subsequent internalisation . C . 2 . Endocytosis and degradation Proteins have a defined lifetime . Either because downregulation is needed in response to an environmental change , or simply to ensure that cellular function is properly fulfilled , cells regularly degrade proteins and provide newly synthesised copies . Proteins targeted for degradation are tagged with ubiquitin , a 76 amino - acid protein that can oligomerise to form polyubiquitin chains . After internalisation by CME , E NDOCYTOSIS - O R H OW C ELLS G ET T HEIR O UTSIDE I N 35 mono - and polyubiquitylated membrane proteins are sorted at the level of endosomes to be sent to lysosomes for degradation by the action of Rab7 and Rab9 among others . Ubiquitylation at the level of the PM often occurs upon ligand binding , as is the case for the EGFR upon EGF binding and some GPCRs such as the β2 - adrenergic receptor ( β2AR ) upon adrenalin binding ( Acconcia et al . , 2009 ) . C . 3 . Endocytosis and recycling The alternative route for internalised receptors that are not destined for degradation is the recycling pathway . Again , TfR is a common model receptor for studying this pathway . Some lipids , such as glycosphingolipids , also follow this route . The sorting between recycling compartments and late endosomes happens at the level of early endosomes ( Figure 1 ) . The mildly acidic environment of these compartments may favour conformational changes that will enable ligands to unbind their receptor . Unbound receptors will then be trafficked to recycling endosomes and back to the plasma membrane for a new cycle ( Dautry - Varsat et al . , 1983 ) . This trafficking pathway is probably regulated by the Rab proteins Rab4 , Rab11 and Rab35 ( Grant and Donaldson , 2009 ) . C . 4 . Endocytosis and signalling Many signalling proteins are internalised by CME . The most obvious consequence of this observation is that removing a receptor from the plasma membrane will prevent it from binding to its ligand therefore preventing its effect . This is important for example in neurotransmission where removing sodium channels from the cell surface diminishes the efficacy of neural communication ( see next Chapter , § G . 4 ) . Endocytosis can also terminate the signalling cascade triggered by ligand - bound activated receptors . This can be achieved as mentioned above , by ligand - receptor dissociation due to the acidic environment of the vesicles and endosomes ( French et al . , 1995 ) , or by spatially segregating the various players of a signalling cascade . The later scenario can be illustrated by the segregation of PLCγ , an effector of many GPCRs , and its substrate PIP 2 as vesicular lipids are turned over into PI ( 3 ) P . On the other hand , endosomes can serve as signal amplifiers or signalling platforms . If the ligand doesn ' t lose its affinity for its receptor in endosomes , the compartmentalisation into a small volume may increase the ligand concentration available to the receptor . This may be the case for the EGFR , which has been shown to remain ligand bound in endosomes , as well as the β2AR which remains associated with its adaptor protein β - arrestin after internalisation . Also , some signalling molecules may require the presence of PI ( 3 ) P or an acidic pH to be activated ( Sorkin and von Zastrow , 2009 ) . Introduction 36 C . 5 . Endocytosis and cell migration Directional cell migration is the basis of multiple processes ranging from embryonic development to wound healing and cancer metastasis . It results from the turnover of focal adhesion sites characterised by the presence of integrins , i . e . transmembrane receptors consisting of two subunits , α and β , that allow cells to link with the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) . The necessary disassembly of focal adhesions for cell migration has been shown to depend on CME . The major adaptors for integrins in this process are ARH and Dab2 which bind β - integrin cytoplasmic tails ( Ezratty et al . , 2009 ) . Endocytosis of integrins and other adhesion proteins has also been involved in axon guidance during development . Although this phenomenon does not involve the migration of the cell body , the leading edge of an emerging axon , called the growth cone , has to extend through a growing network of neurons to form connections in the correct area of the developing brain . It has been shown that CME is implicated both in the internalisation of L1 adhesion proteins at the base of the growth cone to help it grow ( Kamiguchi and Lemmon , 2000 ) as well as at its tip for the internalisation of β1 - integrin to make it steer ( Hines et al . , 2010 ) . C . 6 . Endocytosis and adhesion Integrins exist in active and inactive conformational states , the latter exhibiting higher affinity for its ECM ligand . They mediate both " inside - out " and " outside - in " signalling , i . e . ECM ligand binding will activate the receptor and induce a cellular response , as well as binding of intracellular proteins to integrins will activate them and promote ECM ligand binding . Endocytosis , both clathrin and caveolin mediated , is thus important in regulating the number of integrins at the cell surface to control for this signalling . It has also been shown that after being internalised , activated integrins can be rapidly recycled back to the PM through Rab11 positive endosomes ( Bridgewater et al . , 2012 ) . C . 7 . Endocytosis and cytokinesis Cytokinesis is the final step of mitosis , the phase of the cell cycle through which a mother cell divides into two daughter cells . The actual physical separation is called abscission . There is an ongoing debate in the field as to whether CME is abolished or unperturbed throughout mitosis . Some studies however report that it may be important for cytokinesis itself whether or not it is inhibited in earlier stages of mitosis ( Schweitzer et al . , 2005 ) . It is also interesting to note that abscission and CME share many common features , such as highly curved membranes and a final fission event , and that some molecular players , such as Rab11 and Rab35 , have been shown to be involved E NDOCYTOSIS - O R H OW C ELLS G ET T HEIR O UTSIDE I N 37 in both processes . However , these findings reflect the importance of the endosomal system as signalling platforms in cytokinesis more than an involvement of clathrin dependent internalisation from the PM per se ( Gould and Lippincott - Schwartz , 2009 ) . C . 8 . Endocytosis and cell polarity Cells are never perfectly symmetrical but some cell types have very obvious morphological characteristics such that their membrane and intracellular organisation form distinct , oriented domains . This asymmetry is known as cell polarity which can be either transient , such as during asymmetric division of stem cells and cell migration , or permanent , as is the case for epithelial cells and , most dramatically , neurons . The establishment of cell polarity is predominantly achieved through regulated exocytosis . However , exclusion of proteins from specialised cellular domains can also be achieved via regulated endocytosis ( Horton and Ehlers , 2003 ) . Constitutive CME is also necessary for the maintenance of such polarity , with a constant balance between recycling and degradation of polarity regulators . Conversely , the endocytic machinery may be affected by polarity regulators even though the molecular mechanisms inducing such regulation , via GTPase activation or kinase activity for example , are unclear ( Shivas et al . , 2010 ) . C . 9 . Endocytosis and neurotransmission Understanding how endocytosis can enable , modulate and terminate neurotransmission is the major interest of the present study . Its roles and regulatory mechanisms will therefore be extensively discussed throughout this manuscript . I will thus only mention here that endocytosis is important for all types of neurotransmission : at electrical synapses ( Flores et al . , 2012 ) , inhibitory ( Kittler et al . , 2000 ) and excitatory chemical synapses pre - ( Haucke et al . , 2011 ) and post - ( Malinow and Malenka , 2002 ) synaptically . C . 10 . Endocytosis and pathologies Listing all the pathologies in which endocytosis has been described to be involved would be a long and tedious task that wouldn ' t fit with the scope of this study . I will thus only give a few examples to illustrate the different mechanisms through which endocytosis related diseases can be generated : forced entry of pathogens , malfunctioning of the endocytic machinery and impaired internalisation .  Putting phagocytosis aside , as a specialised mechanism in the recognition and elimination of pathogens , endocytosis is often hijacked by bacteria ( e . g . Lysteria : ( Bonazzi et al . , 2012 ) , toxins ( e . g . anthrax : ( Abrami et al . , 2010 ) ) and viruses ( e . g . HIV : ( Daecke et al . , 2005 ) ) to access the cell interior . Introduction 38  Dysregulation of the endocytic machinery itself has been shown to be very pathogenic . An upregulation of clathrin and dynamin as well as a dysfunction of the endosomal system have been observed in mouse models of Alzheimer ' s disease ( Cataldo et al . , 2000 ; Thomas et al . , 2011 ) . Mutations in AP - 2 as well as in other CLASPs such as amphiphysin and eps15 , have been shown to be related to cancer ( DeCamilli , 1999 ) . Mutations in dynamin are associated with Charcot - Marie - Tooth neuropathy ( Sidiropoulos et al . , 2012 ) . Mutations in an Arf6 - binding protein , TBC1D24 , is related to epilepsy ( Falace et al . , 2010 ) . Mutations in the PIP 2 phosphatase OCRL are linked to diseases such as the occularcerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe ( Lowe , 2005 ) and Dent ' s disease ( Claverie - Martín et al . , 2011 ) . Mutations in the neuron - specific auxilin ( mediating clathrin uncoating ) has been linked with juvenile parkinsonism ( Edvardson et al . , 2012 ) . And the list goes on . . .  Mutations in receptors can also prevent their recognition by adaptors and impair their internalisation , despite an otherwise functional endocytic machinery . This is the case for familial hypercholesterolemia , which is due to a mutation in the low density lipoprotein receptor ( LDLR ) ( Davis et al . , 1986 ) . On the other hand , being one of the major entry routes inside a cell , endocytosis is also greatly studied for its interest in medication . Its many cargo and cell type specific regulatory mechanisms likewise give hope for targeted drug delivery ( Akinc and Battaglia , 2013 ) . As hinted by the variety of cellular functions in which CME is required , this pathway is achieved and finely regulated by the complex interplay between tens of molecules . How does the core molecular machinery achieve membrane deformation and scission while selecting for the right cargo with just the right timing ? This shall be discussed below . D . Focus on Clathrin Mediated Endocytosis CME is the result of an almost stereotyped sequence of protein - protein interactions that are actively being deciphered by the scientific community . The sequence of molecular interactions correlates with the sequential morphological changes undergone by a forming vesicle . The three key proteins without which CME can ' t proceed are clathrin , AP - 2 and dynamin . They are thus sometimes referred to as interaction hubs ( Schmid and McMahon , 2007 ) . Proteins present at a given step form interaction modules and their interactions are believed to be functionally relevant for the ongoing process . These modules can be associated to the following stages : nucleation , maturation , invagination , scission and uncoating ( Figure 5 ) . E NDOCYTOSIS - O R H OW C ELLS G ET T HEIR O UTSIDE I N 39 Figure 5 : Modules of the clathrin mediated endocytosis interactome Coloured circles represent nodes , i . e . the major player of a given module . Grey lines represent some of the known interactions between the various proteins . Thick coloured lines represent interactions believed to drive pathway progression from one step to another . AP - 2 and clathrin appear as major hubs due to their disproportionate number of interaction partners . Importantly , although most proteins do , note that clathrin does not bind directly to either PIP 2 nor cargo receptors . Source : ( McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ) D . 1 . The major molecular players Clathrin was identified as the protein composing the coat surrounding endocytic vesicles in a variety of cell lines in 1976 ( Pearse , 1976 ) . It is composed of two subunits : clathrin light chain ( Clc ) and clathrin heavy chain . At the tip of each heavy chain sits a β - propeller domain called the terminal domain ( TD ) which is responsible for clathrin ' s role as an interaction hub ( ter Haar et al . , 2000 ) . Three heavy and three light chains can assemble to assume a triskelion shape . About 100 triskelia can oligomerise with each other to spontaneously form cages made of pentagonal and hexagonal facets creating a scaffold around the vesicle ( Figure 6 ) . However , clathrin does not bind membranes directly and thus requires adaptors to be properly localised . AP - 2 , for adaptor protein 2 , enables clathrin to localise at the PM thanks to a specific interaction with PIP 2 . It consists of 4 subunits : 2 large α and β2 subunits , called adaptins , one medium sized μ2 subunit and a small σ2 subunit . The large α and β2 subunits are composed of a trunk connected via a flexible linker to a C - terminal Figure 6 : The clathrin cage Schematic of a clathrin cage with 5 triskelia and their TDs highlighted in different colours . Source : ( Schmid and McMahon , 2007 ) Introduction 40 appendage domain ( Figure 7 ) . Each subunit is involved in a variety of protein - protein interactions : the unstructured linkers of adaptins and the β - appendage bind clathrin ; the α / σ2 hemicomplex and the μ2 subunit interact with various cargos according to sorting motifs ; the trunk of α - adaptin and µ2 interact with PIP 2 ( Collins et al . , 2002 ) . Phosphorylation of µ2 can enhance both cargo and PIP 2 binding by changing its conformational state ( Höning et al . , 2005 ) . The α and β appendage domains , sometimes called " ears " , are responsible for the multiplicity of the other AP - 2 interactions with the CME machinery . Both indeed present two subdomain regions that show different affinities for about 20 CLASPs each . Some of these interactions overlap , such as for eps15 and intersectin which can bind both ears , others are ear specific . The α - ear for example interacts specifically with stonin2 and dynamin2 while the β2 - ear is specific for clathrin and β - arrestin binding ( Schmid et al . , 2006 ) . Dynamin is a large , ~ 100 kDa GTPase that can oligomerise into a ring like structure . It was first discovered as a microtubule binding protein . It was however subsequently shown to be implicated in membrane fission during endocytosis with the discovery that the shibire phenotype , a drosophila temperature sensitive mutant with impaired endocytosis at nerve terminals ( Poodry et al . , 1973 ) , was due to a mutation in the dynamin gene ( van der Bliek and Meyerowitz , 1991 ) . Dynamin comprises five distinct domains : the G domain , the bundle signalling element ( BSE ) , the stalk domain , the PH domain and the proline rich domain ( PRD ) ( Figure 8 ) . The G - domain binds and hydrolyses GTP , a catalytic activity that is necessary for scission to occur . It is separated from the rest of the protein by the BSE which is involved in transmitting conformational changes from one domain to another . The stalk domain dimerises to yield a dynamin dimer , the basic unit of a dynamin ring . The PH domain binds to PIP 2 containing membranes as described above ( § A . 2of this section ) . This interaction is rather weak in itself but oligomerisation increases its avidity ( Ferguson and De Camilli , 2012 ) . The PRD is a non - organised domain and has therefore never been crystallised . It is however believed to stick outwards of the ring so as to engage in crutial interactions with other proteins of the endocytic machinery .

( b ) Upon oligomerisation around a membrane tubule template ( grey ) , PH domains are found bound to the membrane , stalk domains engage in a dimer interaction and the G - domains stick out of the helix to meet and dimerise with another G - domain found on the next helical turn upon GTP binding . Source : adapted from ( Ferguson and De Camilli , 2012 ) The following paragraphs will now describe how these three central players interact with other proteins to be recruited to the site of endocytosis and perform their function with the right timing . To this end , the pathway will be broken down into the 5 stages mentioned earlier : nucleation , maturation , invagination , scission and uncoating ( Figure 9 ) . Figure 9 : Canonical view of the various stages of clatrhin mediated endocytosis ( Top ) Schematic representation of the most widely accepted model for CCV formation : Initiation of a clathrin coated structure ( CCS ) and maturation through the addition of clathrin triskelia and AP - 2 molecules at the plasma membrane .

( Bottom ) Electron microscopy images of forming CCVs arranged to correspond to three of the stages illustrated above . Source : adapted from ( Schmid and McMahon , 2007 ) Introduction 42 D . 2 . Nucleation : getting started Advanced imaging and modelling techniques suggest that the very first encounters between clathrin , AP - 2 and the PM may be stochastic , the minimal requirement for a CCP to eventually grow being the concomitant arrival of one clathrin with two AP - 2 adaptors ( Cocucci et al . , 2012 ) . However , even though AP - 2 can interact with the PM , accessory proteins rapidly become necessary for the nascent pit to last longer than five seconds . FCHo is one such early partner and is therefore sometimes referred to as a CCP nucleator . It indeed consistently appears before any significant clathrin accumulation and FCHo depletion abolishes AP - 2 membrane localisation as well as prevents Tfn uptake ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) . There is also an ongoing debate as to whether cargo clustering can promote initiation by itself or if it is induced by AP - 2 arrival . Indeed , artificial extracellular clustering of TfR seems to increase CCP initiation ( Liu et al . , 2010 ) but on the other hand , the same group had already shown that , in simple overexpression studies , increased concentrations of TfR did not increase the number of CCPs ( Loerke et al . , 2009 ) . Moreover , AP - 2 mutant constructs unable to bind TfR are still able to clusterise normally at the PM but can no longer internalise TfR ( Motley et al . , 2006 ) . Therefore , it is more widely accepted that cargo recruitment is not required for CCP initiation . Rather , cargo capture seems to be concomitant with subsequent coat assembly . D . 3 . Maturation : lattice expansion and cargo selection Many studies have implied that as CCPs mature , concentration of cargo accompanies lattice expansion . Indeed , ultrastructural studies show that clathrin lattices of all sizes show a gradual filling of available slots , with gold - labelled TfRs sitting at the summits of clathrin hexagons ( Miller et al . , 1991 ) . Therefore , although cargo may not initiate CCPs , it seems to be responsible for the continuous growth of the lattice . Along the same line of evidence , as mentionned above , TfR overexpression does not influence the number of CCPs but it does increase their lifetime as well as the brightness of clathrin - labelled strutures at the light microscoy level ( Loerke et al . , 2009 ) . For the sake of clarity , the two processes will be discussed seperately in the brief discussion that follows . Lattice expansion : Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how the clathrin and AP - 2 coat can grow in such an orderly fashion . I will briefly mention two of them that both illustrate a feedforward mechanism for oligomerisation . It has been shown that the μ2 subunit can be phosphorylated by AAK1 ( adaptor - associated kinase 1 ) and that this kinase activity is increased by clathrin polymerisation ( Jackson et al . , 2003 ) . Phosphorylation triggers a conformational change in AP - 2 that favours both its interaction with PIP 2 and with YXXɸ motif containing cargos ( Höning et al . , 2005 ) . Therefore , as AP - 2 recruits clathrin , it will be stabilised at the membrane , and recruit even more clathrin . Another mechanism involves a competition for the AP - 2 β - E NDOCYTOSIS - O R H OW C ELLS G ET T HEIR O UTSIDE I N 43 appendage binding site shared by clathrin and other accessory proteins such as eps15 . Eps15 does not bind to clathrin but does bind to the early recruited protein FCHo . Eps15 could help with early recruitment of AP - 2 , which in turn would recruit clathrin . Clathrin and eps15 would compete for the interaction with AP - 2 , in favour of clathrin which is also stabilised by clathrin - clathrin interactions . Eps15 would thus be displaced to the periphery of the polymerising coat where clathrin is not yet stabilised , allowing the lattice to grow further by repeating this cycle ( Schmid et al . , 2006 ) . Cargo selection : Considering the extensive number of receptors endocytosed by CME , it may seem quite surprising at first glance that most cargos don ' t compete for internalisation . First , some cargos , such as the EGFR , are taken up by alternative endocytic routes in a concentration dependent manner ( Sigismund et al . , 2008 ) . Among other implications , considering that cargo loading may be limited ( Warren et al . , 1998 ) , this property may leave some slots available in CCPs for cargos specifically taken up by the CME pathway when needed . Second , as described above , the core and appendages of AP - 2 display a variety of binding sites that can either interact with cargos but also with other , cargo specific , adaptors . For example , the two model receptors to undergo constitutive internalisation by CME are the TfR and the LDLR . The former binds the μ2 AP - 2 subunit via a YXXɸ motif in its C - terminal region . The latter , on the other hand , requires binding to a phosphotyrosine binding ( PTB ) domain containing adaptor such as ARH or Dab2 , which in turn will interact with clathrin and / or the β2 - appendge of AP - 2 . Therefore , TfR and LDLR do not compete for internalisation . Other examples are illustrated in Figure 10 . Figure 10 : Adaptors are required for cargo concentration and selection at CCPs TfR requires the canonical adaptor AP - 2 to concentrate at CCPs for constitutive internalisation . Some receptors , such as the LDLR , can bind to several CLASPs . Others require post - translational modifications in order to bind to their adaptor proteins , such as ubiquitylation of EGFR to bind epsin or phosphorylation of β - arrestins to bind GPCRs . Source : ( Traub , 2009 ) Introduction 44 Importantly , as opposed to the constitutive internalisation of TfR and LDLR , some cargos and adaptors require some form of activation in order to engage with the endocytic machinery . These conditional interactions enable the cell to temporally control what cargo should be internalised . Many signalling proteins don ' t concentrate in CCPs until they are bound to their ligand . This is the case for GPCRs such as the β2AR , but also for some ion channels such as the neuronal glutamatergic AMPAR . Therefore , the selection of the right cargo is a complex but necessary step for the organised , continuous expansion of the clathrin lattice . However , this lattice can grow in two different ways : either as flat plaques or as curved cages ( Figure 11 ) . Whether the first mature into the second , or the two correspond to distinct structures with their own regulatory mechanisms is a matter of debate ( Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ) . Maybe the two possibilities are not exclusive . In any case , in order to eventually become a vesicle , part of the membrane has to be sculpted into a sphere , and all agree that many molecular players are involved in this matter . D . 4 . Invagination : curving the membrane Figure 11 : Various shapes of clathrin structures – from flat to highly curved lattices Examples of clathrin lattices observed by electron microscopy after freeze - fracturing of fibroblasts . The figure is voluntarily arranged so as to suggest progressive invagination of a clathrin lattice into a spherical vesicle ( a to h ) . Source : ( Heuser , 1980 ) Since purified clathrin has the capacity to self oligomerise into cages ( Keen et al . , 1979 ) , it was first proposed that coat polymerisation itself could be the main curvature inducing factor . Studies on minimal systems incubating clathrin on anchor containing liposomes suggest that clathrin alone , depending on the anchor , is indeed enough to drag the membrane along into a spherical bud ( Dannhauser and Ungewickell , 2012 ) . However , the energy contained in clathrin - clathrin bonds is quite weak and may not be stable enough to compete with membrane tension in a more complex cellular environment . E NDOCYTOSIS - O R H OW C ELLS G ET T HEIR O UTSIDE I N 45 The second candidate that comes to mind is of course the actin cytoskeleton , which is responsible for maintaining and modulating cell shape . However , even though actin is unarguably necessary in yeast CME , its requirement in mammalian CME is less clear ( Fujimoto et al . , 2000 ; Aghamohammadzadeh and Ayscough , 2009 ; Boulant et al . , 2011 ) . Thus , although actin has repeatedly been shown to be recruited at sites of endocytosis , and to be implicated at various steps of mammalian CME ( Merrifield et al . , 2004 ; Yarar et al . , 2005 ) , actin polymerisation is unlikely to be the sole membrane shaper during CCP invagination . Several ways have thus been proposed to explain how endocytic accessory proteins could be involved in membrane remodelling ( for review , see ( McMahon and Gallop , 2005 ) ) , the two major ones being membrane scaffolding and membrane insertion . BAR domain containing proteins are believed to help with the induction and / or stabilisation of membrane invaginations in vivo by scaffolding . These domains indeed have a crescent - shaped structure which results from a coiled - coil interaction between two protein monomers . The inherent shape of these proteins have been shown to sense ( Galic et al . , 2012 ) and / or induce ( Takei et al . , 1996 ; Suarez et al . , 2014 ) membrane curvature to a degree that matches the diameter defined by their dimer . Along these lines , the so called " BAR - domain hypothesis " stipulates that the binding preferences of these proteins correlate with the time of their recruitment to forming invaginations . The proteins displaying shallower BAR domains would thereby be recruited first , and the more concave ones later , thus driving the endocytic process forward ( Qualmann et al . , 2011 ; Daumke et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure 12 ) . This hypothesis indeed holds true for some proteins . For example , the FCHo nucleator is a BAR domain containing protein displaying a very shallow diameter , consistent with its presence at early stages of endocytosis ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) . At the other end of the spectrum , APPL1 forms a highly concave dimer and is found very late in the pathway , after vesicle scission , in very early endosomes before PIP 2 is turned over to PI ( 3 ) P Figure 12 : Example crystal structures of dimeric BAR domains BAR domain monomers are represented in yellow and blue . Other domains , such as lipid binding PX and PH domains , are represented in black . The name of the protein containing the represented structure is provided on the left . Curvatures corresponding to the circle diameter defined by the dimers are schematised by a grey line . Source : adapted from ( Qualmann et al . , 2011 ) Introduction 46 ( Zoncu et al . , 2009 ) . However , the validity of the BAR - domain hypothesis becomes questionable , or at least insufficient , at intermediate stages of vesicle formation ( Qualmann et al . , 2011 ) . For example , detailed recruitment profiles of SNX9 , endophilin and amphiphysin , three proteins believed to be involved in dynamin recruitment , showed that SNX9 peak recruitment occurs later than that of amphiphysin and endophilin , the latter two peaking at exactly the same time , despite its shallower crescent shape ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . This may however not necessarily invalidate the BAR domain hypothesis but rather reflect a role for SNX9 at later stages of CME , for example for its role in actin remodelling ( Lundmark and Carlsson , 2009 ) . Membrane insertion is yet another membrane bending mechanism by which proteins insert an amphiphatic helix in the outer leaflet of the membrane bilayer . This insertion will create a defect in the lipid organisation of the membrane which will respond by bending to release the induced stress ( Figure 13 ) . Figure 13 : Membrane bending by helix insertion Lipids of the membrane are represented as polar head groups and acyl chains ( beige ) . The proteinaceous helix is represented in black ( hydrophilic residues ) and green ( hydrophobic residues ) . Source : ( McMahon and Gallop , 2005 ) Several BAR domain containing proteins , including amphiphysin and endophilin , possess such hinges . These proteins are thereby equipped to both induce and stabilise membrane curvature . They could thus sense some degree of curvature by binding to membranes corresponding to their crescent - shaped surface , and then impose a higher degree of curvature to that same membrane by helix insertion ( McMahon and Gallop , 2005 ) . As previously mentioned , BAR domain containing proteins may drive the entire CME pathway forwards . They indeed contain other domains , such as PH / PX lipid binding domains or other interaction modules , that can help with their recruitment as well as with their binding to downstream interactors . Amphiphysin is of particular interest for that reason . It indeed binds to clathrin ( Ramjaun and McPherson , 1998 ) and AP - 2 ( Praefcke et al . , 2004 ) , which could account for its initial recruitment ( Farsad et al . , 03 ) . Then , dimerisation and membrane binding may stabilise it at the CCP . More precisely , its preference for highly curved membranes may favour its localisation at the constricting region of the forming vesicle . As discussed above , helix insertion could then help with further constriction . Finally , amphiphysin contains an SH3 ( Src Hmology 3 ) domain via which it strongly interacts with dynamin . It is thus widely accepted that the presence of amphiphysin is one of the main reasons for the recruitment of dynamin at the neck region , a decisive step that will eventually lead to membrane scission ( Meinecke et al . , 2013 ) . E NDOCYTOSIS - O R H OW C ELLS G ET T HEIR O UTSIDE I N 47 D . 5 . Scission : when vesicles are born As already mentioned several times in this manuscript , dynamin is the one molecule driving membrane scission , i . e . the transition from an invaginated pit at the PM to a newly formed intracellular vesicle . How dynamin physically achieves this feast has been and still is a matter of intense study . Several models have been proposed , each with their experimental evidence and limitations ( Sever et al . , 2000 ) . The five models described in this review , illustrated in Figure 14 , have been the basics of the following 15 years of research on the mechano - chemical properties of dynamin . None of these models has been formerly refuted during that time , with the exception maybe of the rigid helix model , and proposing a consensus model has proved a difficult task ( reviewed in ( Roux , 2014 ) ) . Some of the recent insights on the function of dynamin will be presented here with no claim that they exclusively explain all aspects of this complex mechanism . The common point between all models that a GTP hydrolysis dependent conformational change is required will be particularly highlighted . In short , I Figure 14 : Five proposed models for dynamin ' s function in vesicle scission Green and red " Dyn " labels symbolise conformational changes . P i stands for inorganic phosphate released after GTP hydrolysis to GDP . " E " triangles symbolise an unknown downstream effector .  The Garrotte model : Dynamin changes conformation upon GTP hydrolysis to constrict the neck of the forming vesicle until spontaneous fission . • The Ratchet model : Dynamin reassembles from a looser to a tighter helix upon GTP hydrolysis to constrict the neck of the forming vesicle until spontaneous fission . • The Rigid helix model : Dynamin tightly binds membrane lipids such that the elastic neck below collapses as the helical pitch of the rings increases upon GTP hydrolysis . • The Spring model : The helical pitch of the dynamin rings increases upon GTP hydrolysis so as to generate a force that will shear the membrane at its most fragile point , i . e . where the clathrin coat stops and the dynamin helix starts . • The classical GTPase model : Dynamin recruits a downstream effector in its GTP bound state which would then be responsible for fission after GTP hydrolysis . Source : ( Sever et al . , 2000 ) Introduction 48 will discuss a model in which dynamin is recruited at the neck of invaginating vesicles , ring formation then constricts the neck further while increasing dynamin ' s affinity for GTP as well as its catalytic efficiency . The rings will then undergo a GTP - hydrolysis dependent rearrangement so as to twist along its helical organisation . This will induce tension in the lipid bilayer which will be released by membrane fission . These 4 steps are detailed below : Recruitment : Dynamin alone has elegantly been shown to preferentially oligomerise around curved membranes below 30 nm in diameter at physiological concentrations ( Roux et al . , 2010 ) . This fact alone may explain the timely presence of dynamin when the neck of the invaginating vesicle is partially constricted . However , the C - terminal PRD of dynamin also interacts with many SH3 - domain containing proteins , including the previously mentioned SNX9 , endophilin and amphiphysin proteins , which help with its recruitment . Importantly , amphiphysin is also required for actual membrane scission ( Meinecke et al . , 2013 ) . Along those lines , even though these interactions may be dispensable for dynamin induced membrane tubulation and scission in vitro , it was shown that they are necessary in vivo since dynamin lacking its PRD can ' t rescue endocytic defects in dynamin depleted cells ( Ferguson et al . , 2009 ) . Ring assembly : As mentioned in the brief introduction to dynamin ( § D . 1 of this section ) , its oligomerisation via stalk domain interactions leads to the formation of rings around the neck of the invaginating CCV . In this arrangement , the G domain of a dimer ( i ) will be in very close proximity to the G domain of the dimer ( i + 10 ) found one turn later in the helix ( Faelber et al . , 2011 ) ( see Figure 8 ) . This organisation has several effects favouring scission . First , even though soluble dynamin monomers have little affinity for GTP , it is greatly enhanced by oligomerisation ( Song , 2004 ) . Second , the dimerisation of G domains induces conformational changes that position the active site of the catalytic machinery such that its GTPase activity is optimal ( Chappie et al . , 2010 ) . Third , such geometry constricts the neck to an even smaller diameter of ~ 10 nm ( Roux et al . , 2010 ) , probably by insertion of hydrophobic residues coming from the PH domain into the lipid bilayer ( Ramachandran et al . , 2009 ) . It has been shown that amphiphysin has a role in regulating the rate of dynamin ring assembly via its peculiar SH3 domain ( Owen et al . , 1998 ) as well as a stimulating action on its GTPase activity ( Yoshida and Takei , 2005 ) , probably explaining why amphiphysin more than other SH3 domain containing proteins is necessary for scission . Helical twist : Consistent with the garrotte , ratchet , rigid helix and spring models , dynamin rings have been shown to slide along each other upon GTP hydrolysis leading to a twisting motion of the helix . ( Roux et al . , 2006 ) ( Figure 15 ) . This twist has been recently suggested to be due to a massive reorganisation of the BSE upon GTP hydrolysis which helps connecting G domain activity with stalk domain rearrangements ( Chappie et al . , 2011 ) . E NDOCYTOSIS - O R H OW C ELLS G ET T HEIR O UTSIDE I N 49 Figure 15 : GTP - dependent conformational changes induce a helical twist in the dynamin ring Colour code and symbols are the same as in Figure 8 .

( Right ) Molecular model of the ring constriction using dynamin ' s crystal structure on a tubular template . Source : adapted from ( Left ) ( Ferguson and De Camilli , 2012 ) ; ( Right ) ( Faelber et al . , 2011 ) What regulates the number of rings in vivo is still unknown . Modelling studies suggest that energetically speaking , two rings should be enough considering the occurrence of several cycles of GTP hydrolysis ( Shnyrova et al . , 2013 ) . Experimentally , two recent independent studies using genome edited cells expressing fluorescent dynamin 2 counted an average of 26 dynamin molecules at its peak of recruitment , i . e . at the time of membrane scission . This number corresponds to about 1 turn of a helix ( Cocucci et al . , 2014 ; Grassart et al . , 2014 ) . As for the availability of GTP at the site of endocytosis , it may be controlled by nucleoside diphosphate kinases ( NDPKs ) , molecular motors that directly interact with dynamin and turnover GDP into GTP using ATP ( Boissan et al . , 2014 ) . Membrane fission : Whether these concerted mechanisms are enough for the membrane to spontaneously fuse is still being debated . The requirements in the garrotte , ratchet and rigid helix models would be that constriction of the neck reaches a small enough diameter to favour fusion , i . e . an inner diameter of ~ 4 nm , the size of a lipid monolayer ( Bashkirov et al . , 2008 ) . It has recently been shown that the molecular arrangement of dynamin into a two - start helix ( instead of one - start as usually described ) could lead to an optimised packing of the rings such that the inner diameter of the structure would reach 3 . 7 nm ( Sundborger et al . , 2014 ) . Such a rearrangement could be possible according to the ratchet model . On the other hand , several factors could help with fusion other than mere constriction . For instance , it was proposed that the twisting motion of the rings was not sufficient to induce scission and that longitudinal forces were required ( Roux et al . , 2006 ) . These forces may be generated by the actin cytoskeleton in vivo when needed , which could explain why actin requirement is so variable . Also , it was demonstrated that the energy required for fission was more dependent on the coat aperture ( where the clathrin coat stops and the neck starts ) than on the neck radius at small radii ( Kozlovsky and Kozlov , 2003 ) . These calculations were recently supported experimentally by showing that fission systematically occurred at the edge of the dynamin ring ( Morlot et al . , 2012 ) , disproving the rigid helix model . Introduction 50 Taken together , the new insights obtained since the publication of the five models of dynamin action probably support a combination of the garrotte and spring models , without highlighting the need for adding an unknown downstream effector of dynamin to the model . D . 6 . Uncoating and onwards : the start of a new story Now that the vesicle is formed and that its content is no longer available to the cell surface , it has become an early component of the endosomal system . But to actually be able to fuse with early endosomes it still requires to be uncoated from its clathrin and AP - 2 scaffolds and its lipid composition should be turned over from PIP 2 to PI ( 3 ) P . Clathrin uncoating is an ATP dependent process mediated by the Hsc70 ( heat shock cognate 70 kDa ) chaperone protein . Binding of Hsc70 to a motif in the clathrin heavy chain triggers ATP hydrolysis and the formation of a stable " Hsc70 - ADP : clathrin triskelion " complex favours clathrin disassembly ( Böcking et al . , 2011 ) . The action of Hsc70 on clathrin polymers as well as the timing with which it reaches CCVs just as they were formed is regulated by its binding to GAK , also known as auxilin in neurons ( Lee et al . , 2006 ) . Uncoating of AP - 2 is less well documented but has been shown to depend on the displacement of AAK1 , the kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of the µ2 subunit , by the Rab5 activator hRME6 , thus reducing its affinity for PIP 2 ( Semerdjieva et al . , 2008 ) . This is consistent with the importance of Rab5 in endosome biogenesis ( Zeigerer et al . , 2012 ) . Once uncoated , these proteins become available for a new round of endocytosis and the newly born vesicle is free to fuse with early endosomes so that its cargo can follow its complex route towards recycling or degradation . E . Visualising endocytosis : assumptions and controversies Insights from imaging data have greatly contributed to the shaping of the consensus model of CME I just described . Various ways of looking at the sequential recruitment of proteins to sites of endocytosis have indeed been developed and framed our understanding of the process . Technical details about existing imaging techniques will be discussed in the fourth chapter of this introduction . Nevertheless , a question that will be recurrently raised in different ways throughout this manuscript , can already be pointed out here : what does “ visualising endocytosis " mean ? E . 1 . Cargo uptake Being the primary definition of endocytosis , monitoring cargo uptake is a typical measure of endocytosis . This cargo can either be a fluid phase marker , a lipid E NDOCYTOSIS - O R H OW C ELLS G ET T HEIR O UTSIDE I N 51 soluble dye , or a labelled cargo protein . In the first two cases , as can respectively be visualised by Dextran uptake ( Sojakka et al . , 1999 ) or FM - dye loading ( Betz and Bewick , 1992 ) for example , the monitored endocytosis will not be pathway specific . On the other hand , monitoring the extent of labelled transferrin uptake in cells treated with various pertubations , has been widely used to specifically study CME . One of the most classical internalisation assays consists in incubating cells with Tfn , labelled with a marker of choice , for various periods of time before eventually stripping the extracellular Tfn off from the cell surface and quantifying the internalised fraction . The same principle is applied in so - called antibody feeding assays in which the internalisation of endogenous receptors will be visualised using labelled antibodies targeted against them ( Figure 16 ) . Figure 16 : Example transferrin uptake and antibody feeding assays ( A ) Time course of transferrin internalisation in untransfected ( open circles ) , dynamin wild - type ( squares ) or GTPase - deficient dynamin mutant ( triangles ) transfected cells . Cells were incubated with biotinylated transferrin for the indicated period of time before surface stripping by reducing the biotin - transferrin disulfide bond . ( B ) Pattern of Alexa594 uptake in control ( top ) and dynamin1 + dynamin2 double knock - out cells ( bottom ) . In control cells , transferrin mostly localises to endosomes whereas it remains at the surface in dynamin k / o cells . ( C ) Antibody feeding assay directed against the β2AR in the presence or abscence of its agonist isoproterenol . Source : adapted from ( A ) ( Damke et al . , 1994 ) ; ( B ) ( Ferguson et al . , 2009 ) ; ( C ) ( von Zastrow and Kobilka , 1994 ) One limitation of such internalisation assays however lies in their poor temporal resolution . The mean endocytic activity of a cell can be measured over a certain time - window but the precise moment at which the endocytic vesicles themselves were formed cannot be deduced . Consequently , because vesicles fuse with endocytic compartments within the period of time required for the assay , the location at which they were formed cannot be inferred either . E . 2 . Observing clathrin dynamics Arguably , the most agreed on assay to precisely determine the time and site of vesicle formation is to look at the dynamics of fluorescently labelled clathrin . A vast amount of studies indeed use clathrin uncoating as a reference timepoint to study the kinetics of recruitment of the molecular regulators of CME . As described above , the canonical view of the endocytic pathway closely links the formation of a new CCV with Introduction 52 the removal of its clathrin coat . Co - expression of clathrin , or another coat component such as AP - 2 , together with a protein of interest makes it possible to observe the presence of one relative to the other in living cells . Example alignments of recruitment traces relative to clathrin disappearance are illustrated in Figure 17 . Figure 17 : Protein recruitment profiles aligned to the time of clathrin disappearence ( A ) Top : Disappearance of a clathrin puncta is preceeded by a burst of dynamin fuorescence a few seconds before . Bottom : Averaging the intensity in both channels of such traces indicates that dynamin builds up at CCSs to be maximally enriched prior to scission and discarded within seconds . ( B ) Dynamin recruitment profiles aligned to clathrin appearence and disaprearence and bined by lifetimes of CCSs . ( C ) Similar average recruitment profile as in A for the actin nucleator Arp 2 / 3 , suggesting that actin may be necessary after vesicle uncoating . Source : ( A ) adapted from ( Merrifield et al . , 2002 ) ; ( B ) ( Aguet et al . , 2013 ) ; ( C ) ( Merrifield et al . , 2004 ) Following the assumption that clathrin disappearance is a good reporter of vesicle formation , any treatment resulting in an elongation of CCS lifetimes will strongly support the claim that it also prevents vesicle formation . Example treatments resulting in arrested CCP dynamics include perturbation of the GTPase activity of dynamin and stimulation of GPCRs as illustrated in Figure 18 . E NDOCYTOSIS - O R H OW C ELLS G ET T HEIR O UTSIDE I N 53 Figure 18 : Monitoring CCS lifetimes as a readout of endocytic activity and inhibition ( A - C ) Kymographs displaying clathrin punctae as a function of time . The lifetime of clathrin at the PM is greatly increased by ( A ) application of dynasore , a potent inhibitor of dynamin ' s GTPase activity , ( B ) knock - down of all amphiphysin and endophilin isoforms , and ( C ) application of Pitstop 2 , a small molecule binding to clathrin TD . ( D ) The dwell time of CCSs at the membrane is also increased by agonist - induced clustering of the μ - opioid receptor ( MOR ) . Point mutations in the receptor favouring ( third row ) or preventing ( fourth row ) its ubiquitylation influence this phenomenon . Source : adapted from ( A ) ( Macia et al . , 2006 ) ; ( B ) ( Meinecke et al . , 2013 ) ; ( C ) ( von Kleist et al . , 2011 ) ; ( D ) ( Henry et al . , 2012 ) Although in the vast majority of cases an increased lifetime of clathrin indeed correlates with a reduced internalisation of cargo as measured by uptake assays , it should be noted that clathrin is not the sole determinant of vesicle formation . Observing the dynamics of clathrin structures as a correlate for internalisation may therefore be biased in two ways . On the one hand , short lived clathrin structures ( lifetime < 10 s ) are often considered as “non productive” on the basis that this time is too short for the entire machinery necessary for invagination and scission to come into place ( Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ; Loerke et al . , 2009 ) . Although this assumption can make sense , observing clathrin alone is not enough to validate it . Removing these structures from analysed datasets may therefore underestimate the overall endocytic activity of a cell . On the other hand , longer lived structures are often considered as maturing over various periods of time until they yield one vesicle before the hallmark disappearance of the clathrin signal due to uncoating . Few studies , in cell lines at least , raise the possibility that long lived CCSs may undergo several rounds of cargo internalisation before detectable clathrin disappearance . As will be described below and demonstrated in the Results section of this manuscript , this assumption doesn ' t hold true in several contexts and many studies probably underestimate the endocytic activity of single CCPs . Introduction 54 E . 3 . Morphological determinants A recent technique combining fluorescence and electron microscopy has been used in yeast to study the precise recruitment of various proteins relative to the morphology of invaginating coated pits . They determined , from fluorescence images obtained in living cells , couples of endocytic proteins that systematically arrive to diffraction limited punctae in a sequential manner . Then from fixed sample , they correlated the protein signature of each of these punctae to the ultrastructural morphological profiles of the PM observed at the same locus ( Figure 19 ) . Figure 19 : Protein signatures and morphological changes undergone by forming CCVs ( Top ) Sequence of arrival to CCPs of Sla1 - EGFP , a yeast adaptor protein , and Abp1 - mCherry , an actin binding protein . ( B - D ) Fluorescence images of fixed cells exhibiting Sla1 positive , Sla1 and Abp 1 positive and Abp1 positive punctae . ( E - G ) No endocytic profiles can be observed at Sla1 positive loci , membrane invaginations can be observed at double positive loci ( arrowhead ) and fully formed vesicles in close proximity to the PM can be observed at Abp1 positive loci ( arrow ) . Source : adapted from ( Kukulski et al . , 2012 ) The advantage of this technique is that it unambiguously determines whether an endocytic vesicle has actually pinched off from the PM . It therefore faithfully reports the presence of endocytic proteins relative to true endocytic events with no assumption based on a priori knowledge about the function of these proteins . However , the use of fixed samples prevents the extraction of temporal features such as the time of vesicle scission . E . 4 . Observing membrane scission The so - called pulsed pH assay was developed to circumvent the limitations of each of these techniques , i . e . to visualise cargo uptake in living cells , independently of E NDOCYTOSIS - O R H OW C ELLS G ET T HEIR O UTSIDE I N 55 coat protein dynamics and with good temporal resolution regarding the timing of vesicle formation ( Merrifield et al . , 2005 ; Perrais and Merrifield , 2005 ) . By assessing whether cargo receptors are at the cell surface or in intracellular vesicles every 2 s using a pH - sensitive probe , they could visualise the formation of new vesicles with a 2 s resolution . Interestingly , this assay showed that cargo containing vesicles could form independently of any significant change in the clathrin signal and was used to study the recruitment profiles of tens of proteins with regards to actual scission ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) ( Figure 20 ) . Figure 20 : The pulsed - pH assay reveals new dynamics of endocytosis ( A ) Newly formed TfR containing vesicles ( bottom ) appear at sites of preexisting CCSs ( top ) . This example shows that a single CCS can give rise to at least two endocytic vesicles . The first vesicle ( non - terminal ) would have gone unnoticed by looking at the clathrin signal alone . The second one ( terminal ) forms ~ 18 s before clathrin disappearance . ( B ) Recruitment profiles of dynamin and Lifeact ( an actin binding peptide ) aligned to the time of vesicle detection , i . e . 2 s after vesicle scission . Note the much sharper peak of dynamin as compared to Figure 17A . The fact that Arp3 appeared to peak later when aligned to clathrin disappearance than Lifeact does when aligned to scission probably reflects the uncertainty induced by using clathrin uncoating as a reference timepoint . Source : adapted from ( A ) ( Perrais and Merrifield , 2005 ) ; ( B ) ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) Considering its advantages , this technique has been used for the work presented here . It will thus be described in more details in the last chapter of the introduction as well as in the Methodological developments section . Introduction 56  This introduction to clathrin mediated endocytosis , its physiological roles and molecular mechanisms , has highlighted the importance and complexity of this phenomenon . Many aspects of its regulation are still being actively studied as new insights and new technologies become available to the scientific community . A thrilling field of biology in which membrane trafficking , and endocytosis in particular , is essential is neuroscience . On top of its roles in classical cellular metabolism , endocytosis regulates key aspects of neuronal communication and has been implicated in high cognitive functions such as learning and memory . Before moving on to these exciting aspects I shall give a rapid overview on some major features of neurobiology , with the intention of framing the relevant information that should help with a better understanding of the work presented in this manuscript .  57 N EUROTRANSMISSION – O R H OW B RAIN C ELLS C OMMUNICATE The brain is probably the most complex biological organ to be found and we somewhat know very little about how it acts as a centralised control centre for movement , perception , emotions , cognition and behaviour . Brain research brings together scientists of all disciplinary fields ranging from psychology to medical science , genetics to systems biology , electrophysiology to computer science , chemistry to optical physics . It can also be studied at many different levels from the atomic scale to the freely behaving animal . Considering the scope of the present manuscript , emphasis will be given to cellular and molecular processes mostly based on data acquired by electrophysiological and imaging studies . The general principles of neuronal communication that will be described in this chapter have been extensively reviewed in a number of important reference works and text books such as ( Kandel et al . , 2012 ) on the general principles of brain organisation and function and ( Cowan et al . , 2003 ) more specifically on synapses . F . Components of the brain The brain is part of the central nervous system . It is protected from the outside by the cranium , made of bone , as well as meninges , a three layered envelope that firmly adheres to it . It is floating in cerebrospinal fluid and is irrigated by a continuous cerebral blood flow via a very fine vasculature providing it with nutrients and oxygen to meet its metabolic demands . It is primarily composed of two distinct cell types : glial cells and neurons ( Figure 21 ) . Figure 21 : Brain cells and their interactions Neurons ( blue ) are the site of signal processing and neurotransmission . They are modulated and supported in this task by three main types of glial cells : oligodendrocytes ( purple ) insulate axons with myelin sheaths enabling efficient signal propagation ; microglia ( orange ) ensure proper immune responses to damage or infection ; and astrocytes ( green ) provide the link between blood supply and neurons as well as participate directly in neurotransmission by regulating the chemical environment of neurons . Source : ( Allen and Barres , 2009 ) Introduction 58 F . 1 . Glial cells Glial cells are the most numerous cell type of the central nervous system . In the human adult brain , they outnumber neurons by a factor of ~ 2 and take up about 90 % of brain volume ( Pelvig et al . , 2008 ) . They differ from neurons in that they can undergo cell division and that they are not excitable cells and therefore do not convey electrical signals . Strictly speaking , any cell type in the brain that is not neuronal is a glial cell , thus including ependymal cells ( secreting the cerebrospinal fluid ) and radial glia ( involved in neurogenesis ) in this category . However , the word glia is most commonly used to refer to three specific cell types : microglia , oligodendrocytes and astrocytes . Contrary to what the etymology of the word suggests ( glia , from the Greek " γλία " , meaning " glue " ) , their functional roles are much more diverse than simply holding the neurons together . Historically , the first role of glial cells to be documented was the maintenance of a healthy environment for neurons . Astrocytes indeed support a nutritive role and degrade or take up neuromodulating molecules secreted in the extracellular space , microglia trigger immune responses in the event of brain damage and oligodendrocytes electrically insulate axons by wrapping their membrane around them into what is known as myelin sheaths . However , the role of glial cells in actually shaping the nervous system during development and throughout adulthood ( Ullian et al . , 2004 ) as well as in actively modulating neurotransmission ( Tasker et al . , 2012 ) is now well established . F . 2 . Neurons Neurons are the unitary communication elements in the brain ' s information flow . They can convey information to either another neuron , a muscle cell or a secretory gland . How efficiently the information is conveyed as well as when and where these units are active is key to the correct functioning of the nervous system . Each of the billion neurons of an adult brain may connect to thousands of communication partners . They share many features with other cells of the body but are unique in most aspects . First , the morphology of neurons is extraordinarily complex . The beauty and versatility of neuronal shapes has been observed and documented as early as the 19 th century by Ramón y Cajal , often considered the father of modern neuroscience . His most famous work is based on the Golgi staining technique in which a silver precipitate forms randomly in the entirety of 1 % of the cells observed ( Cajal , 1995 ) . This enabled the visualisation of entire neuronal morphologies in great detail such as illustrated in Figure 22 . N EUROTRANSMISSION - O R H OW B RAIN C ELLS C OMMUNICATE 59 Figure 22 : Complexity of neuronal morphologies Drawing by Ramón y Cajal of a pyramidal cortical neuron . ( a ) Basal dendrites ; ( b ) Apical dendrite and its branches ; ( c ) Axon collateral ; ( e ) Axon ; ( l ) White matter Source : ( Cajal , 1995 ) . - Chapter 3 Neurons are composed of a cell body , called soma , from which two types of processes emerge : a single axon and one to tens of highly branched dendrites , forming the dendritic arborisation ( Samuels et al . , 1977 ) . As illustrated in Figure 22 , dendrites sometimes harbour thousands of tiny protrusions which Ramón y Cajal named dendritic spines . Neurons are thus highly polarised and compartmentalised , hinting to the idea that precise control of the spatial regulation of cellular processes occurring in these cells is fundamental . Second , neurons have the capacity to modulate and respond to variations of their membrane potential : they are excitable cells . Membrane potential is the potential difference between the inside and outside of a cell . It results from stable ionic gradients between the two compartments that are maintained by the presence of ionic pumps on the cell membrane . There is indeed more sodium , calcium and chloride outside a cell , and more potassium inside . Although these gradients exist around all cells , neurons are unique in that they can react to external stimuli by modulating their membrane potential . Thanks to a large variety of voltage sensitive channels that open or close according to changes in membrane potential , neurons can locally modulate their ionic composition . This translates into electrical signals , carried by ion fluxes in the cytoplasm , that can travel throughout the neurons , typically in a very directed way from dendrites to axons via the cell body . Communication between neurons occurs when the electrical signal carried by the axon of an effector neuron is conveyed to a receiving neuron ( Figure 23 ) . Introduction 60 Figure 23 : Neuronal communication An electrical signal ( red arrows ) travelling along the axon of an effector neuron can be conveyed to a receiving neuron at specialised contact sites between axon terminals and dendritic spines ( black box ) called synapses . Source : Biology 1152 Principles of Biological Science ( adapted from http : / / bio1152 . nicerweb . com / Locked / media / ch48 / 48 _ 17ChemicalSynapse . jpg ) Given the complexity of the dendritic arborisation , the receiving neuron is the target of multiple inputs coming from the terminals of thousands of effector neurons . In order to keep propagating the information to yet another cell , this neuron thus has to compute all the inputs it received into a single output that will propagate through its own axon . This phenomenon is known as signal integration . The resulting electrical signal will thus reflect the information perceived from many sources before making its way to the next target . The contact sites at which such communication occurs are highly specialised structures known as synapses . F . 3 . Synapses Before describing synapses in further detail , it should be noted that all the neuronal information is not necessarily processed at these structures . So called extra - synaptic neurotransmission is now widely accepted as a means of modulating neuronal communication over variable distances ( Trueta and De - Miguel , 2012 ) . Chemicals can be secreted directly from the soma or along the axon via dense core vesicles releasing their cargo without identifiable adjacent post - synaptic elements . On the other hand , some receptors , such as GPCRs , are found all along the cellular membrane and do not require to be specifically localised at synapses to bind to their ligands and induce cellular responses . Synapses are however undeniably crucial for the correct functioning of the brain and play a major role in information processing . The word synapse was proposed in 1897 by the British scholar Arthur Woollgar Verrall as meaning " a process of contact " and used for the first time by Foster and Verral in " A textbook of physiology " with the following definition ( Tansey , 1997 ) : ‘‘So far as our present knowledge goes we are led to think that the tip of a twig of the [ axon’s ] arboresc ence is not continuous with but merely in contact with the substance of the dendrite or cell body on which it impinges . Such a special connection of one nerve cell with another might be called a synapsis’’ N EUROTRANSMISSION - O R H OW B RAIN C ELLS C OMMUNICATE 61 Although this structural definition has remained unchanged throughout the years , we now know a great deal more about synapses which actually come in two flavours : electrical synapses and chemical synapses . The former allow very rapid transfer of the signal through tight gap junctions without conversion of the electrical signal . They however do not allow for precise modulation and are thus mostly found in primitive nervous systems of invertebrates or in circuits requiring fast responses such as in defence reflexes . More and more data , however , suggest that electrical synapses do occur in the mammalian brain ( Kim et al . , 2014 ) , but they will not be detailed here since they are not the main focus of the present study . Chemical synapses on the other hand have been extensively characterised , especially since the advent of electron microscopy ( EM ) in the 1950 ' s ( Figure 24A ) . Neuronal communication at these structures requires : 1 ) The conversion of the electrical signal coming from the effector neuron into a chemical signal . This implies that changes in membrane potential at the level of the presynaptic terminal can be sensed by a machinery that will enable the release of chemicals across the synapse . This machinery is composed of synaptic vesicles ( SVs ) that can be exocytosed on demand . They contain neurotransmitters , i . e . chemicals synthesised within the terminal capable of affecting the postsynaptic neuron . The most common neurotransmitters are glutamate and γ - aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) for excitatory and inhibitory synapses , respectively . 2 ) Neurotransmitters should then cross the extracellular space between the pre - and postsynapse called the synaptic cleft . Once on the other side , they will bind to postsynaptic receptors before being either degraded by enzymes present in the cleft , taken up by astrocytes or the presynaptic neuron for reuse , or diffusing away from the cleft . 3 ) Finally , the chemical signal should be translated back into an electrical signal that will travel through the cytoplasm of the receiving postsynaptic neuron . This is achieved by binding of neurotransmitters to postsynaptic surface receptors . These are either ion channels themselves or activate channels via intracellular signalling pathways . As briefly mentioned in the paragraph about glial cells , it is now well established that astrocytes , but also to some extent oligodendrocytes and perhaps microglia , participate actively in synaptic transmission . Scientists often refer to the so - called tri - partite synapse to emphasise the contribution of astrocytes ( Tasker et al . , 2012 ) . In the tri - partite synapse model , astrocytes can control the activation of postsynaptic receptors by clearing ( Murphy - Royal et al . , 2015 ) or secreting ( Parpura and Haydon , 2000 ) glutamate and neuromodulators , such as D - Serine ( Fossat et al . , 2012 ) , in the synaptic cleft . Introduction 62 A B Figure 24 : Anatomical features of synapses ( A ) EM picture of an excitatory chemical synapse showing an axon terminal ( left ) packed with SVs facing the head of a postsynaptic spine ( right ) . The synaptic cleft between the two compartments can clearly be seen , as well as the electron dense postsynaptic density ( PSD ) of the postsynaptic structure . ( B ) Cartoon representation of an excitatory chemical synapse illustrating an incoming electrical signal ( blue arrow ) which triggers the exocytosis of SVs releasing neurotransmitters ( red dots ) in the synaptic cleft .

Glial cells are not represented . Sources : ( A ) ( Rostaing et al . , 2006 ) ; ( B ) adapted from http : / / www . daviddarling . info / encyclopedia / N / neurotransmitter . html Chemical synapses can be broken down into two broad categories : excitatory synapses and inhibitory synapses . Both function as described above but differ in their molecular modes of action as well as their cellular effects . Inhibitory synapses make contact on the shaft of the dendrites and use GABA as their major neurotransmitter . Likewise , GABA receptors can be found clustered on the post synaptic cell . These receptors allow chloride ( or , indirectly , potassium ) influx and therefore lead to a hyperpolarisation of the membrane . On the other hand , excitatory synapses often make contact on dendritic spines which consist of small membrane compartments along the dendrites of neurons . The major excitatory neurotransmitter is glutamate which can bind to various receptors . Ionotropic glutamate receptors ( iGluRs ) comprise the NMDA receptor ( NMDAR ) , the AMPA receptor ( AMPAR ) and the kainite receptor which allow a variety of cations to flow in the cells , leading to a depolarisation of the membrane ( i . e . in an increase in the membrane potential ) . Some iGluRs , in particular the NMDARs are permeable to calcium and their activation can lead to long term changes in synaptic function known as synaptic long term potentiation ( LTP ) or long - term depression ( LTD ) . Metabotropic glutamate receptors count 8 members ( mGluR1 to mGluR8 ) and are rather implicated in modulating neurotransmission than in the propagation of the signal per se . The number of proteins accumulating at the postsynapse and possibly regulating the function of these receptos is such , that they become visible at the ultrastructural level on electron N EUROTRANSMISSION - O R H OW B RAIN C ELLS C OMMUNICATE 63 micrographs as a dark shade directly facing the axon terminal ( Figure 24A ) . It has thus been called the postsynaptic density ( PSD ) . I have so far mostly described the basics of neuronal communication at the cellular and sub - cellular levels . Molecular details of how neurons achieve the feast of modulating their membrane potential on demand , the consequences of hyperpolarisation and depolarisation in axon terminals as well as in dendritic spines , the extreme organisation of the PSD and the characteristics of the principle glutamate receptors ( namely AMPARs and NMDARs ) will be further discussed below . G . Principles of neurotransmission Ion fluxes are the carriers of the electrical signal in neurons . Local ionic concentrations within the cell cytoplasm as well as fluxes in and out of the cell are both critical to the maintenance and modulation of the membrane potential . At rest , it is close to - 70 mV in most neurons . Na + and Ca 2 + influxes as well as K + outflux will lead to depolarisation , Cl - and K + influxes will lead to hyperpolarisation . G . 1 . The action potential and synaptic currents The action potential ( AP ) is the basic electrical impulse carrying neural information . It is the consequence of a stereotyped succession of Na + and K + fluxes . The " neural code " refers to the temporal sequence of APs and is believed to be key to understanding how the brain computes a given input stimulus to turn it into an output behaviour . A single AP is called a spike , a rapid series of spikes is called a train or a burst which are characterised by their frequency , or firing rate . Overall firing of a population of neurons is often referred to as network activity , or simply as " activity " . The AP is an all or nothing phenomenon . It results from the algebraic summation of the graded postsynaptic potentials ( PSPs ) triggered in the dendrites of the receiving neuron by the opening of postsynaptic channels . If this summation , occurring in the axon hillock ( where axon and soma meet ) , leads to a depolarisation strong enough to bring the membrane potential to a given threshold , the neuron will fire an AP . Excitatory synapses will lead to depolarisation , bringing the membrane potential closer to the firing threshold , inhibitory synapses will lead to hyperpolarisation and take the membrane potential away from the threshold ( Figure 25B ) . Summation of PSPs can be either temporal or spatial . The former type is generated by a single neuron when two excitatory PSPs ( EPSPs ) arrive one after the other at high frequency to improve chances of triggering an AP in the target neuron . Broader EPSPs therefore have a greater chance of maintaining the membrane potential high enough until the arrival of another EPSP to help and reach the threshold . The latter happens when inputs of two different Introduction 64 presynaptic terminals reach the hillock simultaneously , allowing an inhibitory input ( IPSP ) to cancel out the effect of an excitatory input , or two excitatory neurons to combine their effects on a single target to jointly induce an AP . EPSPs of greater amplitude therefore contribute more to the triggering of an AP ( Figure 25C ) . Figure 25 : Induction of an action potential ( A ) Several inputs reach the dendrites ( or soma ) of a neuron . Excitatory inputs ( E 1 , E 2 , green ) add up and inhibitory inputs ( I , red ) are subtracted . If the final depolarisation is enough , an AP will be triggered in the axon hillock .

In myelinated axons , propagation is accelerated . The interspaced presence of myelin sheaths allow positive charges to depolarise the membrane only at the neighbouring gap in myelin coverage called nodes of Ranvier . APs can thus jump whole stretches of membrane and reach the terminal much faster than in non insulated axons . This phenomenon is known as saltatory conduction . The timing with which APs are fired must thus be very finely tuned . For a neuron to produce the desired effect in a target cell , the contribution of its thousands of synapses should be taken into account . G . 2 . Axons and the presynapse As already mentioned , neurons have a unique axon . This axon is however highly branched . In these branches , sometimes found millimetres away from the soma , varicosities called synaptic boutons , or terminals , contact target neurons . A single axon can contact thousands of neurons on its way as well as contact the same neuron several times at different locations . When an AP reaches a synaptic bouton , the sudden depolarisation will trigger the opening of voltage gated calcium channels ( VGCCs ) which will lead to a local increase N EUROTRANSMISSION - O R H OW B RAIN C ELLS C OMMUNICATE 65 in calcium concentration . Proteins such as synaptotagmins are specialised calcium sensors that , upon calcium binding , will favour the fusion of synaptic vesicles ( SVs ) with the plasma membrane within a millisecond at a site known as the active zone ( Südhof , 2013 ) . SVs are small vesicles of about 30 - 40 nm in diameter , filled with neurotransmitter , which will be released by exocytosis . SVs are very numerous , typically 100 per bouton , and fill most of the space within ( Figure 24A ) . Their number is however limited and only a few will indeed fuse with the plasma membrane , either because the calcium concentration is too low away from VGCCs , or because they need to be docked and primed to acquire the ability to be released . This translates into each synapse having a different probability of release , a fact that may be very important for neural coding ( Branco and Staras , 2009 ) . After exocytosis SVs are recycled locally in order to refill the original pool of SVs . This happens via endocytosis of membrane and protein components , and still is a matter of intense study . The molecular mechanisms involved in exocytosis and endocytosis at the presynapse will be further discussed in the next section , § A . 1 and § A . 2 respectively . G . 3 . The synaptic cleft Upon exocytosis of SVs , neurotransmitters are released in the synaptic cleft . This 20 - 30 nm wide gap is maintained by adhesion molecules which appose the pre - and postsynaptic elements . It also contains molecules of the ECM which are slowly gaining the attention of neuroscientists for their proposed influence on the nanoscale organisation of the PSD ( Kneussel , 2010 ) . The amount of neurotransmitter molecules released and the time to diffuse away from the release site are essential parameters for the activation of postsynaptic receptors . However , the stochastic process of SV exocytosis , the rapid removal of neurotransmitters by astrocytes , or their diffusion away from the site of release makes it difficult to estimate the active concentration of neurotransmitters in the cleft . Some modelling and experimental evidence suggest that glutamate concentration in the cleft reaches up to almost 1mM after a single AP stimulation and that this is enough to activate postsynaptic receptors , and even induce some spillover that will activate extrasynaptic receptors or neighbouring spines ' receptors , adding yet another layer of complexity in neuronal communication ( Nielsen et al . , 2004 ; Hires et al . , 2008 ) . G . 4 . Dendrites and the postsynapse Signal integration of the thousands of inputs perceived by a neuron every millisecond is done at the level of its dendrites . Membrane conductivity , dendrite diameter , diffusion barriers , branching and backpropagating axons are all means of modulating this process . However , tremendous computation is already achieved at the level of the synapse , and for the sake of clarity , the organisational and functional Introduction 66 characteristics of spines only , i . e . of excitatory chemical postsynaptic compartments , will be discussed here . Spines are morphologically identifiable by the presence of a thin neck protruding from the dendritic shaft . At the end of this neck sits a micron - sized spine head , at the tip of which the PSD can be found . The neck in itself is often considered as a diffusion barrier for chemical compounds , enabling a certain degree of synaptic specificity , e . g . in terms of ionic concentrations ( Tønnesen et al . , 2014 ) . The spine head is a highly motile structure which changes shape and size with activity due to the presence of intensely regulated actin filaments . The PSD per se consists in a 0 . 1 - 0 . 2 µm² patch of highly concentrated postsynaptic receptors , molecular scaffolds , actin filaments and signalling molecules . Recent studies have given a lot of attention to the nanoscale organisation of the PSD and the extensive protein - protein interactions occurring therein . Figure 26 : Molecular organisation of the postsynaptic density Some transynaptic complexes ( Ephrin / EphR and neurexin / neuroligin ) are shown as well as their interaction with postsynaptic partners . Neuroligin binds PSD95 in which the three PDZ domains ( pink ) , the SH3 domain ( light green ) and the GUK domain ( dark green ) are illustrated . PDS - 95 in turn binds to Kainate receptors , NMDARs and AMPAR auxiliary proteins such as stargazin . Other scaffolding proteins including Shank and Homer are also represented linking , among others , mGluRs and IP3 receptors found in the smooth ER . Dark blue ellipses represent actin ( purple ) regulators . Clathrin coated structures can be found on the side of the spine , sitting outside of the PSD proper but still within the spin head . Source : adapted from ( Kim and Sheng , 2004 ) The molecular players of the PSD are numerous , their mutual interactions even more so ( Figure 26 only illustrates a subset of known interactions ) . They are organised around scaffolding proteins such as Homer , Shank , SAP - 97 , SAP - 102 , PSD - 93 N EUROTRANSMISSION - O R H OW B RAIN C ELLS C OMMUNICATE 67 and , the best studied of them all , PSD - 95 . The latter is an important interaction hub and the main organiser of the PSD . It is indispensable for the proper localisation of iGluRs in front of the presynaptic active zone . Since information transfer heavily relies on ion fluxes through postsynaptic receptors , AMPARs and NMDARs are the target of multiple regulatory mechanisms . Their number , their state ( i . e . closed , desensitised or open ) , their localisation , their conductivity , their ion selectivity and so on , are all closely monitored by interaction partners .  The AMPAR is a ligand - gated sodium permeable transmembrane channel made of four subunits ( GluA1 to GluA4 ) . Its unusually large extracellular N - terminal domain is composed of an aminoterminal domain , involved in subunit - subunit contacts , and a ligand binding domain ( Figure 27 ) . Three helices of each subunit contribute to the transmembrane domain which forms the ion - permeable pore when the aminoterminal and ligand binding domains undergo large conformational changes to switch states ( Dürr et al . , 2014 ) . GluA2 lacking AMPARs are Ca 2 + permeable and display distinct physiological characteristics but they represent a minority of receptors in the CNS . AMPAR subunits differ mostly in the sequence of their C - terminal part , or C - tail , which can have variable lengths . This confers specific binding properties to the different subunits , and thus to the various tetramers . Although direct binding of GluA1 to SAP - 97 has been identified , AMPARs do not directly bind to PSD - 95 . They however do so indirectly when complexed with transmembrane AMPAR regulatory proteins ( TARPs ) . TARPs , including stargazing ( γ2 ) , γ4 , γ8 , cornichons , shisas and CKAMP44 , are a family of proteins that have the capacity to modulate ion gating and trafficking properties of AMPARs to the plasma membrane and into the PSD ( Nicoll et al . , 2006 ; Shanks et al . , 2012 ) . They also heavily influence the diffusion of receptors within the plane of the plasma membrane ( Hafner et al . , 2015 ) such that they play a crutial role in the nanoscale organisation of AMPARs which have recently been demonstrated , using super - resolution imaging , to be concentrated in nm - sized subdomains , called nanodomains , within the PSD ( MacGillavry et al . , 2011 ; Nair et al . , 2013 ) . Another important feature about the different nature of AMPAR subunit C - tails is the presence of overlapping NSF and AP - 2 binding motifs specifically on GluA2 ( Lee et al . , 2002 ) . NSF is a protein , enriched in the PSD , known to be involved in membrane fusion and AP - 2 is involved in the internalisation of AMPARs via CME . The Figure 27 : Crystal structure of the AMPA receptor Each subunit is of a different colour . The grey area represents the plasma membrane . ATD : Aminoterminal domain ; LBD : Ligand binding domain ; TMD : Transmembrane domain Source : ( Sobolevsky et al . , 2009 ) Introduction 68 number of AMPARs present at the surface of the PSD , directly facing the presynapse , has a dramatic influence on the efficacy of synaptic transmission . The study of the membrane trafficking of this receptor , its exocytosis to the cell surface , its diffusion towards the PSD , its trapping by PSD - 95 via TARPs in nanodomains as well as it removal , recycling and degradation by endocytosis , thus play a central role in our understanding of neuronal communication ( Opazo and Choquet , 2011 ) .  The NMDAR structurally resembles the AMPAR and also assembles in tetramers of 2 GluN1 and 2 of either GluN2A , B , C or D subunits . They are targeted to synapses in part through binding with PSD95 . So far , no interacting protein similar to the TARPs for AMPARs has been identified with certainty . The function and role of NMDARs in synaptic modulation display unique features among iGluRs . First , NMDARs are permeable to calcium . Second , they can bind glycine or D - serine as a coagonist of glutamate , an amino - acid previously believed to be strictly inhibitory ( Johnson and Ascher , 1987 ) . Third , they trigger vastly different cellular responses depending on their cellular localisation : extra - synaptic activation of NMDARs will preferentially trigger neurodegeneration and cell death whereas synaptic activation will favour synaptic plasticity and cell survival . Finally , NMDARs are voltage - gated , such that they will open only when the membrane is sufficiently depolarised . Indeed , in basal conditions , the pore of the channel is blocked by large divalent cations such as Mg 2 + or Zn 2 + . Upon depolarisation , this blockade is released , dislodging Mg 2 + from the channel and allowing Ca 2 + entry ( Figure 28 ) . NMDARs are thus coincidence detectors of pre - and postsynaptic activity , requiring both glutamate ( and glycine ) binding and depolarisation by AMPARs to open . The consequences of calcium entry on modulating synaptic strength are numerous , dramatic and variable and will be the topic of further discussion in the following section . Figure 28 : Special features of the NMDA receptor The spine on the right was not sufficiently depolarised to release the Mg 2 + block . AMPARs allow Na + influx for signal transduction but NMDARs don ' t open . The spine on the left is more depolarised by the combined Na + influx of two AMPARs . NMDARs open and allow Ca 2 + in , triggering a signalling cascade that will reach the nucleus and induce protein synthesis .

This portrait may have given a rather linear view of neurotransmission , not quite reflecting the highly dynamic nature of the multiple processes allowing for the complexity of synaptic signal processing . Our central nervous system does have the capacity to adjust to its environment and to ongoing neural activity . This adaptability of the brain , its circuitry , its cell shapes and its molecular organisation in response to experience is known as neuroplasticity . H . Synaptic plasticity As the name , taken from materials physics , suggests , the plasticity of the brain refers to its propensity to undergo a permanent change due to externally applied factors . During development , the brain can wire the connections between neurons differentially according to motor - sensory stimulation . It can also partly compensate for neuronal loss due to injury or disease even in adulthood . Moreover , it is widely accepted that almost every animal can learn how to adapt its behaviour after having encountered a situation once or more . Plasticity is therefore a central aspect of modern neuroscience . Surprisingly , neuroscientists of the 20th century most commonly believed that , after a critical developmental period , the brain was predominantly static ( Wiesel and Hubel , 1965 ) . We now know that neuroplasticity occurs in many situations , leading to a great variety of cellular responses due to the multiplicity of the , more or less well understood , underlying molecular mechanisms . For the purpose of this manuscript , I shall only focus on synaptic plasticity , i . e . on the mechanisms involved in modulating the strength of synaptic transmission . Other forms of plasticity , such as post - traumatic re - wiring or sensory motor mapping during development , will not be discussed . Synaptic plasticity refers to the fact that , for a given input ( a sequence of APs ) , the intensity of the output ( the amplitude and decay of the EPSP ) can vary in time at a single synapse . If the EPSP is bigger or broader than before , the synapse will be potentiated . If the EPSP is smaller or shorter , the synapse will be depressed . H . 1 . Short term plasticity Short term plasticity does not reflect a permanent change in synaptic strength but rather a time - limited modulation of a few milliseconds to a few minutes . It often results from presynaptic modulations , but the properties of post - synaptic receptors could also contribute . The best known example of short term potentiation is the paired - pulse facilitation : when an AP reaches the terminal , Ca 2 + concentration Introduction 70 increases . The more Ca 2 + , the more SVs will fuse . Clearance of Ca 2 + takes a few milliseconds and if a second AP comes before that , allowing more Ca 2 + in , Ca 2 + will build up and the probability of neurotransmiter release will increase with the second AP ( Katz and Miledi , 1968 ) . On the other hand , short term depression of some atypical synapses can be induced by desensitisation of calcium channels resulting in the opposite effect on SV exocytosis ( Forsythe et al . , 1998 ) . A mechanistically similar form of short term depression can be induced in the event of a stronger stimulation by the desensitisation of postsynaptic AMPARs . Indeed , after opening upon glutamate binding , AMAPRs rapidly desensitise , preventing the influx of Na + charges regardless of the presence of glutamate ( von Gersdorff and Borst , 2002 ) . H . 2 . Long term plasticity Longer lasting changes in synaptic strength can affect synapses on a timescale of tens of minutes to days . Long lasting changes in synaptic strength have long been considered as the molecular and cellular correlates of learning and memory ( Alkon and Nelson , 1990 ; Hebb , 2005 ; Kessels and Malinow , 2009 ) . Indeed , long lasting plasticity is both input specific and associative , two important features of memory ( Figure 29 ) . Figure 29 : Shared characteristics of LTP and memory CA1 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus exhibit two important features of memory ( A ) Specificity , where LTP inducing stimulation in one set of synapses doesn ' t affect non activated neighbouring spines and ( B ) Associativity , where a weakly stimulated set of spines can undergo LTP if a neighbouring set of spines receives a strong enough stimulation close in time . Source : http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / books / NBK10878 / ) Memories can be selectively retrieved according to a given stimulus without influencing the state of other memories . Similarly , input specificity relates to the fact that a set of synapses can be potentiated ( or depressed ) without affecting neighbouring synapses ( Matsuzaki et al . , 2004 ) . Therefore , the connecting point between two neurons is actually being modified , not the overall state of the target cell . Associativity is a hallmark of memory thanks to which we are capable of remembering the relationship between two unrelated items such as a friend ' s birthdate and favourite colour . The parallel can be drawn at the cellular level with the observation that if a set of synapses is weakly stimulated ( too weakly to undergo plasticity on its own ) right before another set of synapses on the same cell is adequately stimulated ( by the input of a different N EUROTRANSMISSION - O R H OW B RAIN C ELLS C OMMUNICATE 71 neuron ) , both pathways will undergo permanent changes ( Frey and Morris , 1997 ) . These common features between synaptic plasticity and memory suggest that understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating synaptic weights is important for understanding brain function . Neuronal populations of several structures of the brain are known to be capable of undergoing such long lasting modifications , including the cortex , striatum , cerebellum , amygdala and hippocampus ( Malenka and Bear , 2004 ) all of which are involved in some aspects of memory . The hippocampus is one of the best studied structures relative to synaptic plasticity and its role in declarative memory has often been demonstrated . The two best documented postsynaptic forms of hippocampal long term plasticity are known as long term potentiation ( LTP ) and long term depression ( LTD ) ( Figure 30 ) . At the molecular level , both heavily rely on the activation of the NMDAR and induce a change in the number and properties of AMPARs present at the cell surface in the PSD . Figure 30 : Long lasting bidirectional modulation of synaptic strength A long , low frequency electrical stimulation ( 1Hz , 10 min ) decreases synaptic strength while a short , high frequency stimulation ( 2x 100 Hz ) increases it . Both stimuli induce long lasting effects that drive synaptic efficacy away from its basal level . Source : ( Lüscher and Malenka , 2012 ) LTP will result from a rapid and strong stimulation such as a burst of APs reaching the synaptic terminal , or the activation of pre - and post - synaptic neurons in close succession , a mechanism referred to as spike timing dependent plasticity ( STDP ) . In all cases , plasticity inducing stimuli activate NMDARs , thus increasing intracellular Ca 2 + concentration . This in turn will induce the activation of kinases such as PKA , PKC and CAMKII in the spine which will phosphorylate various sites of GluA1 C - tail ( Henley et al . , 2011 ) . These changes will increase the conductivity of AMPARs as well as their number at the cell surface , both extrasynaptically ( Yudowski et al . , 2007 ; Lin et al . , 2009 ) and in spines ( Hayashi et al . , 2000 ; Kennedy et al . , 2010 ) . The actin cytoskeleton is also modified by the action of Arc and other actin regulatory proteins , leading to spine enlargement ( Dillon and Goda , 2005 ) , probably to accommodate for the newly inserted AMPARs . Later on , protein synthesis is required to maintain these changes ( Bramham , 2008 ) . Many molecules can modulate LTP induction or maintenance , including endocannabinoids ( Sugaya et al . , 2013 ) and glial derived factors such as D - serine ( Henneberger et al . , 2010 ) . Finally new synapses can form , often by splitting of an existing synapse ( De Roo et al . , 2008 ) . Introduction 72 LTD also results from Ca 2 + entry through NMDARs . It occurs when the opening of this receptor is minimal but prolonged in time , and is best induced with low frequency stimulation coupled to moderate depolarisation , or when the activity of the postsynaptic neuron precedes that of the presynaptic neuron . Low levels of Ca 2 + will activate phosphatases such as calcineurin and induce changes in the binding properties of various proteins such as PICK1 , a PDZ - and BAR domain containing protein , known to interact , with actin and the GluA2 subunit of AMPARs ( Hanley and Henley , 2005 ; Rocca et al . , 2008 ) . These changes are accompanied by the internalisation of AMPARs , reducing their number at the cell surface and thus reducing synaptic strength ( Malinow and Malenka , 2002 ) as well as modifications in the actin cytoskeleton such that the size of the spine head will shrink ( Dillon and Goda , 2005 ) . Finally , as for LTP , protein synthesis is necessary at a later stage for LTD maintenance ( Huber et al . , 2000 ) and many modulators can be found , such as the dopaminergic system ( Chen et al . , 1995 ) and glial derived factors , such as ATP ( Pougnet et al . , 2014 ) . Since LTP and LTD have mirror effects , it has long been tempting to describe their roles in memory as LTP being involved in learning and LTD in forgetting . Very recent and skillful work , looking at the amygdala in fear conditioning experiments , has indeed provided strong evidence for a long awaited causal link between LTP , LTD and memory ( Nabavi et al . , 2014 ) . Also , both mechanisms must occur synergistically to ensure proper homeostasis of the brain ( Kubota et al . , 2009 ; Zenke et al . , 2013 ) . Understanding how long term plasticity actually translates into behaviour is definitely a challenge that neuroscientists are actively taking up .  In this chapter and the preceding one , I have attempted to draw a general framework about the fundamental cellular and molecular features of endocytosis and neurotransmission . The next two chapters will now aim at describing the interface between those two major fields of biology . Considering the extreme dynamicity of such processes as neurogenesis , circuit wiring , neurotransmitter release , signal transduction , plasticity and so on , it is not all that surprising that membrane trafficking events are involved in many aspects of neuronal cellular function . For exocytosis and endocytosis to be useful players in this complex scheme , removing , displacing and releasing membrane and proteins from one compartment to the other should be achieved in a spatially and temporally controlled manner according to need . Observation and description of these phenomena will be detailed in the next chapter . Technical means of studying , perturbing and controlling them will be proposed in the following one .  73 M EMBRANE T RAFFICKING I N N EURONS – A M ULTIPURPOSE B IOLOGICAL P HENOMENON Rather that detailing all aspects of membrane trafficking important for neuronal function as the title of this chapter may suggest , I will , unsurprisingly , focus on endocytosis . However , more than in any other cell type , endocytosis is tightly coupled to exocytosis in neurons . Although the molecular details of the exocytic machinery will not be extensively presented in this manuscript , some mechanisms in which it is involved will be illustrated here , hence the generalised chapter title . Moreover , although exo - and endocytosis are greatly involved in shaping neuronal structure throughout development , focus will be granted here on their function , mechanism and regulation in the mature brain . A . Trafficking at the presynapse Intense membrane trafficking continuously goes on in the presynapse ( Figure 31 ) . Impressive scientific effort has been devoted to precisely describe the proteinacious components of presynaptic boutons , most of which is implicated in the cycling of synaptic vesicles and its filling with neurotransmitter molecules . In particular , components of the exocytic machinery can count thousands of protein copies while components of the endocytic machinery add up to a few hundreds ( Wilhelm et al . , 2014 ) , suggesting that endocytosis may be a rate limiting factor in synaptic vesicle trafficking . Trafficking of SVs is probably the most studied trafficking phenomenon , with detailed morphological characterisations and an exhaustive description of the molecular machinery involved in SV exocytosis being available ( Takamori et al . , 2006 ) . Soon after exocytosis , proteins and membrane are recycled to the pool of SVs by endocytosis . As will be described in this chapter , a large body of evidence points to the fact that SV retrieval from the PM is largely mediated by CME . However , other endocytic pathways may enable such recycling and clathrin may also play other roles than the canonical lipid and protein retrieval from the PM it is known to mediate . Understanding the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the SV cycle , its kinetics and its spatial requirements , as well as their role in regulating short term plasticity , are very topical research interests . Introduction 74 Figure 31 : Trafficking of synaptic vesicles in a presynaptic terminal ( Left ) Upon arrival of an AP , synaptic vesicles fuse with the PM at the active zone ( bottom left , dark grey ellipse ) . Various recycling pathways then replenish the vesicle pool : ( 1 ) conventional CME ( 1a . ) clathrin dependent budding from cisternae ( 2 ) kiss and run ( 3 ) clathrin independent ultrafast endocytosis and ( 4 ) formation of new SVs from endosomal intermediates ( EI ) by an unknown mechanism .

Neurotransmitter release via exocytosis Precise timing of neurotransmitter release is a fundamental aspect of neural coding . The succinct description provided here is based on a recent review by Nobel laureate Thomas Südhof ( Südhof , 2013 ) and is illustrated in Figure 32 . Fusion of SVs with the PM occurs within 1 ms after the arrival of an AP at the region of the bouton directly facing the PSD and called the active zone . It is mediated by the presynaptic exocytic machinery which involves a complex interplay between SNARE proteins , Munc18 , complexin and synaptotagmin . Vesicular VAMP2 , and membranous syntaxin1 and SNAP25 , three proteins of the SNARE family , form a tight complex bringing vesicles close to the PM . This complex is energetically stabilised by the presence of Munc18 . Zippering of the 4 helix core formed by the SNARE complex brings vesicles so close to the PM that the lipid bilayers are destabilised and fuse , thereby creating a fusion pore through which neurotransmitters are released . The extremely rapid timing with which calcium entry through VGCCs triggers exocytosis is achieved by a competition between complexin and the calcium sensor synaptotagmin . At rest , complexin tightly binds to the SNARE complex and inhibits spontaneous fusion . Upon calcium influx , synaptotagmin will in turn bind to the SNARE complex thereby releasing the complexin clamp and triggering fusion . A M ULTIPURPOSE B IOLOGICAL P HENOMENON 75 In addition , the precise localisation of synaptic vesicles in the vicinity of VGCCs requires the involvement of RIM proteins , which bind both to VGCCs and proteins found on the synaptic vesicle . Therefore , the careful spatial organisation of the presynaptic active zone enables the exact timing of release . Figure 32 : Molecular components regulating SV exocytosis The SNARE complex forms between the SV and the PM such that the two membranes are placed in close proximity . As calcium gets in through Ca 2 + - channels , localised close to the docked vesicle via the coordinating activity of RIM proteins , synaptotagmin triggers fusion by unbinding complexin from the SNARE complex . Source : ( Südhof , 2013 ) A . 2 . Synaptic vesicle recycling via endocytosis After neurotransmitter release , neurons can hardly rely on supply from the cell body to replenish the SV pool . Recycling of exocytic machinery components and newly added membrane therefore occurs locally within the terminal . Depending on the strength of the stimulation , and thereby the amount of material to be recycled , various internalisation pathways come into play . This is best evidenced by membrane capacitance measurements which are directly correlated to the area of cellular membrane such that exocytosis will lead to an increase in membrane capacitance while endocytosis will be measured by a return to basline levels ( Neher and Marty , 1982 ) . Using this technique as a readout for endocytosis , moderate stimulation leads to a dual component rate of rapid ( < 1 s ) and slow ( 5 to 20 s ) internalisation whereas strong stimulation leads to the slower formation of large invaginations from the PM ( von Gersdorff and Matthews , 1994 ; Jockusch et al . , 2005 ) . The latter mechanism is known as Introduction 76 bulk endocytosis and is thought to be neuron specific to cope with intense stimulation ( Smith et al . , 2008 ) . The mechanism for the fastest mode of endocytosis is still being debated . Two , non exclusive , mechanisms have been proposed to account for the rapid component of internalisation : kiss - and - run ( Figure 31 , pathway 2 ) and ultrafast endocytosis ( Figure 31 , pathway 3 ) . The former is a highly debated mechanism through which the fusion pore , rather than expanding to lead to full collapse of the SV within the PM , rapidly closes back ( Zhang et al . , 2009 ) . This would imply that some SVs could maintain their identity and be recycled to the pool of vesicles as such . The latter was recently identified by combining optogenetics stimulation with high pressure freezing ( Watanabe et al . , 2013 ) . PM invaginations start to appear at the side of the active zone ~ 100 ms after stimulation and give rise to vesicles within a second . These structures are twice as big as SVs and their fate and role in SV recycling have yet to be fully characterised ( Watanabe et al . , 2014 ) . The mode of endocytosis with intermediate kinetics is widely accepted as being CME ( Figure 31 , pathway 1 ) . As will be further discussed in the next chapter ( § B . 3 and § B . 4 ) , interfering with the proteins involved in CME in synaptic terminals indeed leads to major defects in neurotransmission . Among others , deleting clathrin ( Granseth et al . , 2006 ) or the neuron specific isoform of dynamin , dynamin 1 , ( Ferguson et al . , 2007 ) were morphologically and functionally shown to impair SV retrieval . Three noticeable features emerge from the observation of neuronal clathrin coated structures . First , their size ( ~ 80 nm ) is smaller than in other cell types ( ~ 100 - 150 nm ) making the bilayer curve inside the cage with about the same diameter as synaptic vesicles ( ~ 40 nm ) . It has been suggested , from data obtained in drosophila , that this is regulated by the clathrin adaptor AP180 and that it may provide a direct route for SV recycling ( Zhang et al . , 1998 ) . Second , it can be directly modulated by steady state intracellular calcium , a characteristic that has not been demonstrated in other cell types ( Wu et al . , 2009 ) . Finally , considering the timing required for neurotransmission to be faithfully relied , they must form on a much faster time scale than canonical CCVs . Indeed , from initiation to fission , CME typically takes ~ 1 min . This could be in part regulated by the specific properties of the neuronal isoforms of CME related proteins , namely dynamin1 and 3 , amphiphysin 1 , endophilin 1 , AP180 and synaptojanin1 ( Ferguson et al . , 2007 ; Milosevic et al . , 2011 ) . Moreover , it could be possible that coat components are preassembled in synaptic terminals allowing for faster uptake within a few tens of seconds ( Mueller et al . , 2004 ; Hua et al . , 2011 ) . Interestingly , clathrin , AP - 2 and dynamin dependent budding events have also been observed from endosomes or endosome - like cisternae ( Takei et al . , 1996 ; Kononenko et al . , 2014 ; Watanabe et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure 31 , pathway 1a ) . Those structures were once proposed to follow bulk endocytosis but the most recent of these studies proposed that this mechanism may be the sole involvement of CME in the presynapse . The possibility that CME is not involved in SV retrieval from the PM but at later stages in the recycling process could somehow reconcile A M ULTIPURPOSE B IOLOGICAL P HENOMENON 77 contradictory results obtained using a variety of techniques and protocols ( Watanabe et al . , 2014 ) . Regarding the molecular players involved , neuronal CME may be mediated rather canonically by clathrin , AP - 2 or AP - 180 , amphihysin and dynamin 2 ( Jockusch et al . , 2005 ; Wu et al . , 2010 ; Hosoi et al . , 2009 ) , while ultrafast endocytosis would require the combined action of endophilin and dynamin 1 and 3 together with actin ( Llobet et al . , 2011 ; Sundborger et al . , 2011 ; Kononenko et al . , 2014 ; Watanabe et al . , 2013 ) . As for further recycling of SVs after retrieval from the PM , it seems that the clathrin / AP - 2 dependent budding from intracellular cisternae is necessary to prevent complete depletion of the vesicle pool ( Kononenko et al . , 2014 ) but that another , less documented , clathrin and dynamin 1 independent pathway can also reform SVs from those cisternae ( Figure 31 , pathway 4 ) ( Wu et al . , 2014 ) . The process of SV recycling may therefore have been intensely studied for the past four decades , we are still far from having a detailed understanding of the precise mechanisms underlying it . It is therefore the subject of fruitful scientific investigations . A . 3 . Traffic regulated short term plasticity The brief description of short term plasticity discussed in the previous chapter ( § H . 1 ) has illustrated presynaptic Ca 2 + and postsynaptic receptor dependence . However , a well described form of short term plasticity depends on the efficiency of SV trafficking . Presynaptic fatigue depends on the number of SVs available for release ( Dutta Roy et al . , 2014 ) . This number decreases with time since the docking and priming , not to mention the recycling of SVs , take much more time than the arrival of 2 APs in a train . Primed and docked SVs constitute the readily releasable pool ( RRP ) of vesicles , available upon moderate stimulation . SVs from the so - called recycling pool ( RP ) are then recruited during sustained release . A third pool , known as the reserve pool , rarely contributes to neurotransmitter release although it constitutes most of the SVs present in the terminal ( Rizzoli and Betz , 2005 ; Ikeda and Bekkers , 2009 ) . Gradual depletion of the RRP pool induces an exponential decrease of the synaptic response during a train of APs . After intense stimulation , the RRP and RP can even be completely depleted , and the synapse becomes unable to produce an EPSP for a short refractory period of a few tens of seconds ( Liu and Tsien , 1995 ) . It has been suggested that the identity of a SV belonging to one pool or the other may depend on the mechanism by which it has been internalised . Kiss - and - run internalisation may replenish the RRP straight away , CME would contribute to refilling the recycling pool and budding from cisternae could form the reserve pool ( Voglmaier and Edwards , 2007 ) . Much more could be said about membrane trafficking at the presynapse . Neurons have evolved impressive ways of coping with sustained stimulation at presynaptic terminals to faithfully transmit information . Molecular mechanisms Introduction 78 regulating exocytosis , sorting and recycling of the components of this machinery and modulation of these processes compose a vast and fascinating body of research . However , the results presented in this manuscript will not focus on SV trafficking but rather on somatodendritic endocytosis . So let us cross the synaptic cleft and have a look at the postsynapse . B . Trafficking at the postsynapse As introduced in the previous chapter , the dendritic spine is a highly organised compartment . Misleadingly , the description of the PSD given in Figure 26 may convey a rather static impression of this structure . On the contrary , receptors at the cell surface are actually not fixed at a given location for long ( Figure 33 ) . Figure 33 : AMPA receptor trafficking at the postsynapse Lateral diffusion in and out of the spine as well as a tight balance between endocytosis and exocytosis regulate the surface number of AMPARs in dendrites , in spines and at the PSD . Plasticity inducing protocols modulate the binding properties of AMPARs with cytoplasmic molecules which in turn regulate their trafficking properties . Regulatory mechanisms are written in red font . Intracellular organelles and membrane microdomains are written in blue font . AMPAR interacting proteins are written in black font . Source : ( Anggono and Huganir , 2012 ) Most importantly , the number of AMPARs facing the presynapse varies greatly with activity and is the most influential factor for the efficiency of rapid excitatory transmission . As already mentioned , long lasting changes in the efficacy of this transmission is widely believed to be the cellular correlate for learning and memory . For the sake of clarity and coherence , the only forms of postsynaptic long term plasticity that will be detailed here will be hippocampal NMDAR mediated LTP and LTD . One should however note that plasticity of NMDAR mediated currents also exists ( e . g . see A M ULTIPURPOSE B IOLOGICAL P HENOMENON 79 ( Morishita et al . , 2005 ) ) and that LTD of AMPAR mediated currents can be induced in various brain structures ( Malenka and Bear , 2004 ) , by many different triggers such as mGluR activation ( Oliet et al . , 1997 ) or insulin application ( Man et al . , 2000 ) . I have thus made the choice to exclusively focus the following paragraphs on the trafficking of AMPARs in the hippocampus ( for extensive review , see ( Malinow and Malenka , 2002 ; Kennedy and Ehlers , 2006 ; Henley et al . , 2011 ) ) . To this aim , I shall discuss three major determinants of the dynamics of AMPARs at the postsynapse : lateral diffusion , exocytosis and endocytosis . B . 1 . Lateral diffusion of receptors The total number of AMPARs in basal conditions appears to be rather stable at the PSD . Indeed , individually evoked EPSCs are of very similar amplitude from one stimulation to the other . However , plenty of studies from the past decade have demonstrated that individual receptors constantly go in and out of synapses by diffusing in the membrane . They have also shown that a given receptor diffuses over long distances in the dendritic shaft but may be confined to a restricted area while in the spine ( Borgdorff and Choquet , 2002 ; Groc et al . , 2004 ) . Several forces may allow for such mobile and immobile behaviours according to the compartment being explored by the receptor : brownian motion ( dictated by membrane fluidity ) , directed movement from binding to intracellular motors and trapping by ECM molecules , cytoskeletal elements or PSD scaffolding proteins , etc . ( Rusakov et al . , 2011 ) . Moreover , the regulation of AMPAR mobility is not only tuned by direct intracellular interactions between the receptor and its binding partners but also between its accessory proteins , the TARPs , and their own binding partners ( Bats et al . , 2007 ; Hafner et al . , 2015 ) . Importantly , lateral mobility or immobilisation of AMPARs have been implicated in influencing short term plasticity by respectively allowing or preventing desensitised AMPARs from being replaced by functional ones ( Heine et al . , 2008 ; Constals et al . , 2015 ) ( Figure 34 ) . Figure 34 : Mobile AMPARs regulate the recovery from paired - pulse depression After neurotransmitter release , activated AMPARs ( red ) rapidly desensitise ( black ) . Mobile desensitised AMPARs can diffuse out of the PSD and be replaced by functional resting AMPARs ( green ) so that paired - pulse depression is minimal whereas immobilised desensitised AMPARs lead to an increased paired - pulse depression . Source : ( Heine et al . , 2008 ) The same mechanism may be important in regulating long term plasticity and a three step model for LTP and LTD has recently emerged in which LTP would result from exocytosis of AMPARs followed by diffusion of these receptors inside the spine and trapping by intracellular scaffolds at the PSD , resulting in an increase in synaptic Introduction 80 strength ( see Figure 33 , right hand side ) . Conversely , LTD would start with the destabilisation of AMPAR from its scaffolds , followed by its diffusion out of the PSD and endocytosis in perisynaptic zones ( Figure 33 , left hand side ) ( Opazo and Choquet , 2011 ) . B . 2 . Long term potentiation via exocytosis Years ago , exocytosis has been demonstrated as being important for the maintenance of LTP and proposed as a mechanism for the insertion of new AMPARs at the PSD ( Lledo et al . , 1998 ; Maletic - Savatic et al . , 1998 ) . Since then , the molecular mechanisms regulating postsynaptic exocytosis have been extensively studied . With regards to the receptor , these mechanisms seem to be subunit specific . Under basal conditions , GluA1 is exocytosed ~ 10 times more often than GluA2 ( Lin et al . , 2009 ) . After LTP induction , both subunits see their exocytic frequency increase but with different kinetics , GluA1 being exocytosed > 10 times more than at rest within 1 min and GluA2 ~ 5 times more than at rest peaking 5 minutes after stimulation ( Tanaka and Hirano , 2012 ) . Phosphorylation of GluA1 at various residues by kinases such as CaMKII , PKA and PKC are necessary events for the induction of LTP and promote the incorporation of AMPARs at synapses ( Henley et al . , 2011 ) . Among others , these changes are believed to modulate the interactions between GluA1 and its binding partners , thereby modulating its trafficking properties . Along those lines , phosphorylation by PKC enhances GluA1 interaction with the actin binding protein 4 . 1N which in turn facilitates synaptic AMPAR insertion ( Lin et al . , 2009 ) . As for the fusion machinery per se , the molecular players involved in driving AMPAR exocytosis are much less well characterised than those enabling neurotransmitter release at the presynapse . The postsynaptic vesicular SNARE is widely accepted as being VAMP2 , i . e . the same as for presynaptic fusion . However , membranous SNAREs are more elusive . For example SNAP25 ( Lin et al . , 2009 ) , SNAP23 ( Suh et al . , 2010 ) and SNAP47 ( Jurado et al . , 2013 ) have all been proposed to regulate postsynaptic exocytosis but the most recent and systematic study of this machinery argues in favour of SNAP47 being exclusively required for LTP induced AMPAR exocytosis ( SNAP25 and SNAP23 being involved in NMDAR surface expression ) ( Jurado et al . , 2013 ) . On the other hand , both syntaxin4 ( Kennedy et al . , 2010 ) and syntaxin3 ( Jurado et al . , 2013 ) isoforms have been reported to be necessary for LTP . However , contrary to syntaxin4 , syntaxin3 seems to be exclusively required for activity dependent , and not basal , AMPAR exocytosis . Because LTP is triggered by Ca 2 + entry through the NMDAR , AMPAR exocytosis is calcium dependent . However , even though complexin has been shown to have the same role pre - and postsynaptically , its action is not mediated by competition with synaptotagmin1 at the postsynapse . There are 17 synaptotagmin isoforms , two of which are exclusively expressed in dendrites and one of them , synaptotagmin 3 , being calcium sensitive ( Dean et al . , 2012 ) . Whether any of these are specific for LTP induced AMPAR exocytosis is still unknown . A M ULTIPURPOSE B IOLOGICAL P HENOMENON 81 The precise localisation of AMPAR exocytosis is another long standing , not fully elucidated , question . To date , few studies support the idea of direct exocytosis in the spine . Notably , ( Kennedy et al . , 2010 ) have observed exocytosis of TfR and GluA1 in the spine and ( Yang et al . , 2008 ) propose , from electrophysiological data , a model where AMPARs are delivered to a functionally defined perisynaptic site that may be within the spine but is not the PSD itself . Most studies , on the other hand , suggest that exocytosis occurs exclusively in dendrites ( Oh et al . , 2006 ; Yudowski et al . , 2007 ; Lin et al . , 2009 ; Makino and Malinow , 2009 ; Tao - Cheng et al . , 2011 ) . However , these studies do not all deal with AMPAR exocytosis , nor are they always conducted following LTP inducing protocols . In any case , regardless of the precise exocytic site , it has become apparent that exocytosis itself , although necessary , is not sufficient to support LTP . Indeed , it has been shown that only 10 - 30 % of newly inserted AMPARs at the synapse upon LTP induction come from a pool of newly exocytosed receptors ( Patterson et al . , 2010 ) . As mentioned in the previous paragraph , recent findings about the potential of lateral diffusion of receptors have led some groups to suggest that recruitment and trapping of diffusing extrasynaptic AMPARs at the PSD is the major mechanism responsible for the near instantaneous increase in synaptic strength observed during LTP . Exocytosis would then come in second , with a slower time constant , to replenish the pool of surface , extrasynaptic receptors ( Oh et al . , 2006 ; Makino and Malinow , 2009 ) . B . 3 . Long term depression via endocytosis As mentioned earlier in this manuscript , LTD is a quasi - mirror image of LTP . Not only functionally , but also in terms of the molecular events involved . First , according to the three step model described above , AMPARs need to be destabilised from the synapse where they were trapped and diffuse away from the PSD . Whether this is mediated by dissociation of AMPARs from its TARPs ( Tomita et al . , 2004 ; Constals et al . , 2015 ) or whether the entire complex is being trafficked upon LTD induction ( Matsuda et al . , 2013 ) is a matter of debate . Then , where LTP activates kinases , LTD requires the activation of phosphatases such as the calcium sensitive calcineurin ( Beattie et al . , 2000 ) and protein phosphatase 1 ( PP1 ) ( Lisman , 1989 ; Mulkey et al . , 1994 ) . How these changes target AMPARs for internalisation is little understood . They may regulate the properties of AMPARs directly or the properties of the CME machinery itself . Much fewer studies have focused on the latter option than the former , with a few recent exceptions : e . g . ( Unoki et al . , 2012 ) propose that calcineurin and PP1 dephosphorylate a PIP5 - kinase so that it can bind AP - 2 and increase PIP 2 biosynthesis specifically under LTD inducing conditions . They thereby provide a direct link between LTD and increased internalisation rates . Also , ( Tao - Cheng et al . , 2011 ) show that the number of CCPs found in close proximity to PSDs at the ultrastructural level increase in numbers and in GluA2 concentration after LTD induction . This observation suggests that not only are AMPARs targeted to CCPs , but endocytic activity itself is positively modulated during plasticity . Introduction 82 In contrast , plenty of studies focus on the activity induced modifications of the phosphorylation states of the GluA1 and GluA2 subunits , and how this would target AMPARs to existing CCPs . Since , LTD requires the interaction between GluA2 and AP - 2 ( Lee et al . , 2002 ) , models that would allow for a modulation of this interaction have been proposed . In this regard , the fusion protein NSF is of particular interest . Indeed , NSF and AP - 2 interact with GluA2 via an overlapping binding motif . NSF has been shown to inhibit LTD ( Lüthi et al . , 1999 ) , suggesting a model where NSF would either drive or stabilise AMPARs at the cell surface whereas its displacement would allow for AMPAR binding to AP - 2 and subsequent internalisation . Whether the affinity of GluA2 for NSF is activity dependent as well as whether NSF actually dissociates from GluA2 during LTD is currently unknown . The PDZ - domain containing proteins PICK1 and GRIP1 / 2 are also some of the most studied GluA2 interacting partners ( Figure 35 ) . Their role in regulating AMPAR surface expression is widely accepted ( Kim and Sheng , 2004 ) but whether they do so by enhancing internalisation rates or stabilising intracellular pools of receptors is still a matter of debate ( Braithwaite et al . , 2002 ; Hanley , 2008 ) . Just as NSF and AP - 2 do , PICK1 and GRIP bind GluA2 via overlapping sequences . Balance between GRIP and PICK1 binding to AMPARs has been proposed to depend on GluA2 phosphorylation at the S880 site ( Kim et al . , 2001 ) . GRIP unbinding from S880 - phosphorylated GluA2 is important for LTD expression ( Seidenman et al . , 2003 ) and may be the physiological trigger that allows AMPARs to diffuse away from the PSD into perisynaptic zones . Figure 35 : Possible regulation of AMPAR endocytosis by GluA2 interacting proteins ( Left ) Model in which ( A ) GRIP binding to GluA2 favours surface localisation of AMPARs . ( B ) Ca 2 + entry upon NMDAR activation destabilises GRIP / GluA2 interactions in favour of PICK1 / GluA2 interactions thus favouring AMPAR internalisation leading to synaptic LTD . ( C ) Maintenance of LTD requires the stabilisation of AMPARs in intracellular pools , potentially by interaction with GRIP . ( D ) PICK1 may then be involved in recycling of AMPARs back to the PM . ( Right ) PICK1 may play important roles leading to the formation of new endocytic pits . ( A ) At rest , actin filaments would counteract membrane tension . ( B ) Ca 2 + entry would drive PICK1 to an " open " active state which would allow its binding to GluA2 . ( C ) The BAR domain of PICK1 and its inhibitory effect on actin polymerisation could help stabilise membrane curvature against membrane tension , ( D ) thus allowing the formation of an endocytic vesicle . Source : adapted from ( Hanley , 2008 ) A M ULTIPURPOSE B IOLOGICAL P HENOMENON 83 Even though PICK1 seems to be implicated at many steps of AMPAR trafficking processes , especially as an inhibitor of surface recycling ( Lin and Huganir , 2007 ) , its potential for directly influencing internalisation rates is interesting . First , PICK1 is Ca 2 + sensitive , making it , with calcineurin , a good molecular candidate to explain the calcium dependence of LTD induction ( Hanley and Henley , 2005 ) . Second , it is a BAR domain containing protein and this domain is important for proper LTD maintenance ( Jin et al . , 2006 ) . As detailed in the first chapter of this introduction , the presence of a BAR domain suggests that PICK1 may play a role in inducing or stabilising endocytic invaginations . This hypothesis has however never been directly tested for . Third , PICK1 interacts with the Arp2 / 3 complex , a key regulator of the actin cytoskeleton ( Rocca et al . , 2008 ) . However , loss of neither PICK1 ( Lin and Huganir , 2007 ) nor GRIP ( Mao et al . , 2010 ) seem to influence basal and LTD dependent rates of endocytosis . It should also be noted that despite the apparent importance of GluA2 in mediating NMDAR dependent hippocampal LTD ( Lee et al . , 2004 ) , this form of plasticity has also been observed in neurons lacking this subunit ( Meng et al . , 2003 ) . In short , the precise chain of molecular events leading to AMPAR internalisation that induce long term synaptic depression remains mostly unknown . Whether postsynaptic CME is mechanistically different from conventional CME , as it is the case in the presynapse , remains unknown . In contrast to the multiple endocytic pathways regulating presynaptic recycling , evidence supports the idea that AMPARs are , probably exclusively , endocytosed at the postsynapse by CME ( Malinow and Malenka , 2002 ) ( but also see ( Glebov et al . , 2015 ) ) . Indeed , AMPAR interaction with AP - 2 ( Lee et al . , 2002 ; Kastning et al . , 2007 ) and dynamin activity ( Carroll et al . , 1999 ; Lüscher et al . , 1999 ) are both required for proper AMPAR internalisation . Concerning the size of postsynaptic CCVs , few systematic measurements have been conducted using EM . This must reflect the belief that postsynaptic CME is more conventional than presynaptic recycling . However , according to ( Cooney et al . , 2002 ) , postsynaptic CCVs measure on average ~ 70 nm , a diameter closer to that of presynaptic CCVs than in cell lines . They also often observed clathrin coats involved in budding from tubular structures at the base of spines , suggesting a role of clathrin in endosomal sorting . More surprisingly , very little kinetics data are available about the dynamics of CME in this compartment . This issue mainly arises from the difficulty to observe endocytosis in these structures . As discussed at the end of the first chapter ( section E . ) , observing the appearance and disappearance of clathrin by optical microscopy is a common measure of a cell’s endocytic activity . However , fluorescently labelled clathrin appears to be very static in the somatodendritic compartment of mature neurons ( Blanpied et al . , 2002 ; Lu et al . , 2007 ) . Therefore , most of our knowledge about the kinetics of stimulated internalisation of AMPARs comes from biochemistry and antibody feeding assays and not , as in other cell types , from precise analyses of clathrin dynamics ( Figure 36 ) . Using these techniques , several studies focusing on LTD monitor the effects of a variety treatments by looking at AMPAR internalisation at a given time point , therefore Introduction 84 providing no information about the time course of the process ( Beattie et al . , 2000 ; Hanley and Henley , 2005 ; Unoki et al . , 2012 ) . Taken together , a few notable exceptions have nonetheless led to the consensus that activation of the NMDAR for 1 to 5 min leads to a ~ 20 - 40 % decrease of GluA1 and GluA2 subunits from the surface within 5 to 15 minutes ( Carroll et al . , 1999 ; Ehlers , 2000 ; Mao et al . , 2010 ) . Figure 36 : Visualising endocytosis in postsynaptic compartments ( A ) Kymographs showing the stability of CCSs in the dendrites of mature neurons ( 2 min recordings ) . Black arrow indicates the disappearence of a clathrin signal ( B ) Antibody feeding assay showing the increased internalisation of GluA1 as compared to control in neurons co - transfected with GluA1 and GluA2 and treated for 2 min with 50 µM NMDA followed by 8 min of incubation at 37 °C before fixation . Source : ( A ) adapted from ( Blanpied et al . , 2002 ) ; ( B ) ( Lee et al . , 2004 ) Localisation - wise , immunocytochemical and biochemical data may be even more difficult to interpret . It has been proposed that AMPARs and TfRs do not traffick via the same pathway because they have not been observed in the same intracellular structures ( Beattie et al . , 2000 ) and are differentially affected by LTD inducing protocols ( Zhou et al . , 2001 ) . Considering the poor temporal resolution of these assays , this may however reflect differential sorting steps rather than differential internalisation routes . A more recent EM study indeed reports that both TfR and GluA2 can be seen in perisynaptic CCPs after 2 - 5 min of NMDAR activation . Yet , no co - labelling was performed , thus not ruling out the possibility that both receptors are differentially internalised ( Tao - Cheng et al . , 2011 ) . Similarly to AMPAR insertion by exocytosis , AMPAR removal by endocytosis may occur directly in the spine as well as in the shaft . It was proposed that the kinetics of internalisation would differ in these two compartments , with shaft endocytosis occurring much faster than synaptic endocytosis ( Ashby et al . , 2004 ) . It should nevertheless be noted that this observation was made using a chemical LTD inducing protocol which activates NMDARs over the entire cell . Whether an electrically induced LTD protocol , by definition activating preferentially synaptic NMDARs , also induces rapid shaft endocytosis remains unclear . On the other hand , contrary to exocytosis , direct observation of internalisation events has so far never been achieved in neurons , due in part to the lack of available techniques to do so , A M ULTIPURPOSE B IOLOGICAL P HENOMENON 85 as well as , again , the lack of apparent clathrin dynamics in these cells . The presence of clathrin coated structures has however been repeatedly reported in close proximity to the PSD at both the optical and ultrastructural level ( Lüscher et al . , 2000 ; Blanpied et al . , 2002 ; Cooney et al . , 2002 ; Tao - Cheng et al . , 2011 ) ( Figure 37 ) . Figure 37 : Clathrin coated structures are found in close proximity to the postsynaptic density ( a ) Electron micrographs showing a deeply invaginated CCP on the side of a spine head ( left ) and a fully formed CCV within the spine head ( right ) , scale bar : 200nm ; ( b ) Clathrin punctae ( red ) can be seen in close proximity to , but not overlapping with , the PSD marker PSD - 95 ( green ) . ( c ) These structures remain apposed for long periods of time even though the spine undergoes morphological changes ( Time given in minutes ) . Source : adapted from ( a ) ( Rácz et al . , 2004 ) ; ( b ) and ( c ) ( Lu et al . , 2007 ) The functional significance as well as the molecular mechanisms leading to the establishment of these perisynaptic zones are being highly debated . According to ultrastructural studies , perisynaptic CCPs are quite rarely observed . ( Cooney et al . , 2002 ) found that in adult rats , only 10 % of dendritic CCSs were found within spine heads or spine necks in basal condition while ( Tao - Cheng et al . , 2011 ) observed coated invaginations in only 2 . 5 % and 4 . 6 % of synaptic profiles before and after NMDAR activation respectively . On the other hand , in mature cultured hippocampal neurons , ( Blanpied et al . , 2002 ) observed that ~ 70 % of the spines contained a clathrin signal at the optical level . This discrepancy may be due either to an underestimation of flat ( non - invaginated ) portions of membrane coated with clathrin but not visible by visual inspection of EM sections in the absence of gold labels , or to an overestimation of synaptic endocytic zones at the optical level due to overexpression artefacts and low resolution imaging . The group in favour of an important role for local synaptic trafficking have elaborated their model over the years with few other laboratories reporting similar findings . In this model , the establishment of stable endocytic zones at synapses seems to be independent from neuronal activity ( Blanpied et al . , 2002 ) but their presence is necessary for the correct expression of AMPARs to the PSD ( Lu et al . , 2007 ) and for LTP induction ( Petrini et al . , 2009 ) . This group also suggests the attractive idea that the binding of dynamin 3 to the scaffold protein Homer would be responsible for the perisynaptic localisation of these endocytic zones . This claim has however been recently compromised by other studies showing that the dynamin 3 antibody used to support the postsynaptic localisation of this dynamin isoform is non - specific ( Raimondi et al . , 2011 ) . In all cases , little is known about the actual endocytic activity of these Introduction 86 synaptically localised clathrin coated structures in terms of producing cargo loaded CCVs . Whether this activity is necessary for and / or modulated by LTD inducing protocols has been even less investigated . Those matters about postsynaptic endocytosis kinetics and localisation have motivated part of the work presented in the Results section of this study and will be further discussed in the following chapter .  This chapter has not only illustrated how fundamental membrane trafficking may be in shaping neurotransmission , it also highlighted the complexity of the mechanisms involved in the regulation of endocytosis in the context of neuronal plasticity . It also underlined how our understanding of the precise spatiotemporal dynamics of AMPAR trafficking is still somewhat limited . When one is faced with deciphering such a complex phenomenon , it becomes crucial to ask the right questions , choose the right model and use or develop the right tools . From description to perturbation , from cell lines to brain slices , from biochemistry to live cell imaging , endocytosis is a demanding field of study .  87 M EMBRANE T RAFFICKING I N N EURONS – A D EMANDING T ECHNOLOGICAL C HALLENGE The advent of fluorescent proteins in the 1990 ' s , the ever growing toolbox to perturb cellular phenomena and the seemingly infinite possibilities offered by light - activated molecules are all part of the exciting technologies that cellular biologists and neuroscientists have developed and applied to push back the limits of our understanding . The aim of this fourth and last introductory chapter is to briefly present a selected panel of these techniques and point out some of their advantages and limitations with regards to studying neuronal endocytosis . I shall try to provide the arguments that led us to the methodological choices we have made to reach our Objectives as described in the next section of this manuscript . A . The need for imaging techniques Sometimes fuelling sometimes taking advantage of new developments , the study of endocytosis somehow shares a common history with microscopy . As highlighted in the first chapter of this introduction , imaging based studies of yeast and immortalised cell lines have enabled the identification of a complex molecular sequence of events , mostly relative to clathrin disappearance upon uncoating of newly formed vesicles . In the third chapter , I illustrated how different the situation is in neurons and how immunohistochemical , eletrophysiological , biochemical and electron microscopy data often lack information on the dynamics of the process . I shall thus describe in the following paragraphs how the availability for imaging technologies has both shaped and limited our knowledge about endocytosis in cell lines , in the presynapse , and in the postsynapse . A . 1 . Seeing is believing The first images of CME date back to the early 1960 ' s when electron microscopy was already widely in use for the study of biological samples ( Roth and Porter , 1964 ) . From a series of static micrographs taken at various timepoints , the authors foresighted the dynamicity of the entire process ranging from ligand binding to shallow pits , and coat driven invagination all the way to vesicle scission , uncoating and endosomal fusion . A few years after the identification of clathrin as the one major coat protein ( Pearse , 1976 ) , immunofluorescence studies uncovered the dotted organisation of clathrin structures at the PM ( Anderson et al . , 1978 ; Bloom et al . , 1980 ) . But it was not until the very end of the century that CME was eventually observed in living cells thanks Introduction 88 to the revolution driven by fluorescent fusion proteins ( Gaidarov et al . , 1999 ) . These early observations of clathrin dynamics , using clathrin labelled to the green fluorescent protein ( Clathrin - GFP ) , revealed 3 CCP profiles : some appear gradually and disappear abruptly after a few tens of seconds ; some see their fluorescence decrease gradually before vanishing ; and others persist for long periods of time , from which highly motile clathrin structures seem to emerge . The authors proposed that the first profile illustrates conventional CME , where the increase in fluorescence reflects clathrin polymerisation and clathrin disappearance reflects uncoating of the pinched off vesicle . The second profile would be due to flat structures invaginating into budding vesicles by progressive removal of clathrin triskelia , to go from a mostly hexagonal to a mixed hexagonal and pentagonal structure . And the third profile would demonstrate that coated vesicles may derive from part of a pre - existing lattice that would remain at the PM as a new nucleating site ( Figure 38 ) . They also insist on the observation that CCPs often do not appear randomly on the PM but rather at defined locations into so - called endocytic hotspots . Figure 38 : Imaging the dynamics of clathrin structures reveals several endocytic mechanisms ( A ) Clathrin - GFP expressed in COS - 7 cells reveals disappearing punctae ( curved arrow at 4 . 5 s disappears in the following frame ) as well as motile punctae ( arrow head appearing at 4 . 5 s ) that seem to arise from static clathrin structures ( arrow ) . ( B ) Utrastructural details obtained by EM show that some CCPs are seen in isolation ( arrowhead ) whereas others are seen budding from the side of flat clathrin lattices ( arrow ) . These profiles may correlate with the various dynamic profiles seen in living cells . Source : adapted from ( A ) ( Gaidarov et al . , 1999 ) and ( B ) ( Fujimoto et al . , 2000 ) Advances in microscopy then rapidly increased the spatial and temporal resolution required for the study of such a dynamic process . ( Merrifield et al . , 2002 ) demonstrated soon after that the use of Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy , which only illuminates the sample ~ 100 nm away from the coverslip , A D EMANDING T ECHNOLOGICAL C HALLENGE 89 greatly improved spatial resolution in the z - axis over classical epifluorescence microscopy , making this technique ideal for the study of vertical movements away from the PM ( Figure 39 ) ( also see § B . 1 , p . 119 in the Methodological developments section for more details about this technique ) . Figure 39 : Optical advantages of TIRF illumination for the study of endocytosis ( A ) Observing the adherent surface of an NIH - 3T3 cell within a few tens of microns from the coverslip using TIRF illumination ( right ) gets rid of a lot of out of focus fluorescence emanating from deep within the cell as seen under epifluorescence illumination ( left ) . ( B ) The disappearance of a single clathrin structure ( boxed in a ) from the TIRF field ( bottom ) but not in epifluorescence ( top ) reflects the vertical movement undergone by the CCP upon invagination at least 40 s before clathrin uncoating . Source : ( Merrifield et al . , 2002 ) Studies using TIRF microscopy then flourished to provide temporal information about the recruitment of proteins at various stages of CCV formation ( Merrifield et al . , 2004 ; Lee et al . , 2006 ; Loerke et al . , 2009 ; Liu et al . , 2010 ; von Kleist et al . , 2011 ) etc . ( see the first chapter of the introduction for more details about how these papers improved our knowledge about CME ) . However , these studies and others share a common limitation in that their temporal reference point is the disappearance of a clathrin signal from the TIRF field of view . As already pointed out , this disappearance is assumed to correlate with vesicle formation but this assumption may be problematic in several instances . First , some clathrin structures may form and vanish without displaying any endocytic activity . Second , the kinetics of clathrin disappearance come from the mixture of the vertical movement imposed to the vesicle and the uncoating reaction . Thus , even assuming that the uncoating reaction would always occurs at a defined time after vesicle formation , this technical limitation makes it difficult , if not impossible , to determine the exact timing of cargo uptake . Third , the formation of vesicles emanating from static CCSs is only possible to infer when motile punctae are seen moving away from static ones in the x - y plane . Thus , this population of CCVs is often not taken into account at all ( with the notable exception of ( Puthenveedu and von Zastrow , 2006 ) in which ' blinking ' of the clathrin signal is also interpreted as an endocytic event ) . To circumvent these issues , ( Merrifield et al . , 2005 ) developed the pulsed - pH assay presented in § E . 4 of the first chapter . Inspired from the study of single exocytic events , they tagged the TfR with a pH - sensitive fluorophore ( see next paragraph for more details ) and then repetitively modulated the extracellular pH by alternatively perfusing neutral and acidic solutions around the cell ( see p . 127 in the Introduction 90 Methodological developments section for more details about this technique ) . The pulsed - pH protocol greatly enhanced our knowledge of the molecular choreography involved in CME ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) ( Figure 20 ) . By combining live cell imaging , TIRF illumination and rapid solution exchange , this assay is , so far , the best compromise between temporal and spatial resolution for the study of endocytosis in living cells . Correlative microscopy , which combines optical and electronic microscopy , is another good compromise between the maintenance of some form of temporal resolution while gaining access to minute ultrastructural details ( Kukulski et al . , 2012 ) ( Figure 19 ) . It has however only been used in yeast cells up until now , and , by design , ends with cell fixation . At the price of losing temporal information , several studies have also greatly improved the spatial resolution of optical images , in mammalian cells , by using superresolution microscopy on fixed samples . Indeed , vesicles are less than 100 nm in size and pits and lattices range from 10 to > 300 nm in certain cell types ( Heuser , 1980 ) . The size of clathrin structures therefore often fall below the ~ 200 nm theoretical resolution limit of conventional optical microscopy . Therefore , STORM ( Grove et al . , 2014 ) , 3D - STORM ( Huang et al . , 2008 ; Wu et al . , 2010 ) and STED ( Opazo et al . , 2012 ) imaging , three optical methods providing ~ 20 nm x - y resolution , have been used to describe the complex morphologies of CCPs and endosomes . The studies performed so far using superresolution are however more impressive for their technological potential than for their functional insight on the process of CME . Nevertheless , it is easy to foresee that those technologies surely will one day greatly enhance our understanding of the finer details of this intriguing machinery . A . 2 . Imaging endocytosis in the presynapse Clathrin itself has been little used to image the spatial and temporal dynamics of endocytosis in the presynapse as compared to what is done in cell lines . First , because whether CME is indeed a major pathway for SV recycling from the PM is still a matter of debate . Thereofre , when studying SV retrieval without considering the pathway involved , clathrin may not be a marker of choice . Second , because neuronal CCVs fall below the diffraction limit of optical microscopy . Clathrin labelled terminals therefore appear as unresolved punctae and observing the intensity profiles of such punctae have led to contradictory results . Clathrin has been reported to be recruited from an extra - terminal pool before concentrating in boutons upon stimulation ( 750 Aps ) ( Mueller et al . , 2004 ) ( Figure 40A ) as well as to diffuse out of boutons following stimulation ( 40 Aps ) ( Granseth et al . , 2006 ) . Attempts to visualise endocytic zones at the presynapse have therefore relied on the visualisation of accessory proteins or of SV bound cargo proteins in giant synapse models . Early immunofluorescence studies in drosophila have demonstrated that , at the presynapse , dynamin is spatially restricted to some subdomains of the nerve terminal ( Estes et al . , 1996 ) and EM serial reconstruction in the lamprey showed that A D EMANDING T ECHNOLOGICAL C HALLENGE 91 endocytosis occurred in a ring shaped area surrounding the exocytic active zone ( Gad et al . , 1998 ) ( Figure 40B ) . This typical spatial organisation is most probably regulated by the actin cytoskeleton and a variety of proteins involved in CME such as amphiphysin and intersectin seem to relocate from the SV cluster to this periactive zone after stimulation ( Evergren et al . , 2004 , 2007 ) ( Figure 40C ) . Figure 40 : Spatial organisation of the endocytic periactive zone ( A ) Clathrin relocates from a diffuse signal along the axon to concentrate in boutons ( arrows ) after stimulation . ( B ) EM serial reconstruction of a stimulated nerve terminal shows that following stimulation , endocytosis ( blue dots , CCPs ) occurs within a spatially restricted ring - like area around the active zone ( red ) . Grey lines delineate the membrane ( C ) Within a single nerve terminal , amphiphysin ( green ) and actin ( red ) relocate from a concentrated punctae beleived to be the SV cluster ( top ) to a large ring structure after stimulation ( bottom ) . Source : adapted from ( A ) ( Mueller et al . , 2004 ) ; ( B ) ( Gad et al . , 1998 ) ; ( C ) ( Evergren et al . , 2004 ) As mentioned in § A . 2 of the previous chapter , it was long known from capacitance measurements that the kinetics of SV endocytosis had a dual component . Technological advances in EM have made it possible to image both these components ( Watanabe et al . , 2013 , 2014 ) despite the use of fixed samples . Indeed , stimulation of synaptic terminals provides an interesting temporal reference point to study the kinetics of endocytosis that other cell types don ' t have . Nonetheless , many studies have turned to optical microscopy in living cells to study the entire SV cycle ranging from exocytosis to endocytosis and recycling . A widely used tool for such studies came with the development of pHluorin ( Miesenböck et al . , 1998 ) , and its improved variant super - ecliptic pHluorin ( SEP ) ( Sankaranarayanan et al . , 2000 ) , a pH - sensitive mutant of the then recently developed enhanced green fluorescent protein ( EGFP ) ( Cormack et al . , 1996 ) . This tool was specifically developed to look at the exocytosis of SVs : as vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane , SEP - tagged proteins go from the acidic environment of the vesicular lumen to the neutral pH of the extracellular space . An increase in SEP fluorescence thus will reflect exocytosis . Then , as the tagged proteins are being recycled , they conversely go from the neutral extracellular space , to an acidic environment as the vesicles reacidify . A decrease in SEP fluorescence will thus reflect endocytosis ( Figure 41A and B ) . This assay has been widely used to study the effect of various proteins in regulating the SV cycle ( Nicholson - Tomishima and Ryan , 2004 ; Granseth et al . , 2006 ; Herman et al . , 2014 ) . Introduction 92 Figure 41 : Monitoring exocytosis and endocytosis using pHluorin tagged proteins ( A ) pHluorin is fused to a vesicular protein such as VAMP so as to face the intravesicular lumen . Intracellular organelles of acidic pH are not visible at resting state ( blue ) but become fluorescent upon vesicle fusion ( green ) . As the vesicle reacidifies after endocytosis , the fluorescence will be quenched again ; ( B ) Physiological response of electrically stimulated nerve terminals as monitored by SEP fluorescence intensity . Upon exocytosis of SVs as soon as the train of action potentials starts , a burst of green fluorescence is detected . Once the stimulation is over , SEP fluorescence gradually goes back to baseline , which is attributed to endocytosis . ( C ) Application of bafilomycin ( Baf ) reveals the extent of exocytosis blinded by the decrease in SEP fluorescence due to the acidification of rapidly endocytosed vesicles . Source : adapted from ( A ) and ( B ) ( Sankaranarayanan et al . , 2000 ) ; ( C ) ( Ferguson et al . , 2007 ) However informative , this assay shows some limitations . First , regarding exocytosis , it should be noted that average fluorescence traces such as the one shown in Figure 41B reflect the balance between exocytosis and endocytosis at a nerve terminal . Therefore , if acidification is not prevented , e . g . by addition of bafilomycin , the extent of exocytosis is likely to be underestimated ( Figure 41C ) . This issue can be overcome by looking at single fusion events , elicited by single stimulation , which are readily detectable as transient flashes of green fluorescence ( Balaji and Ryan , 2007 ; Zhu et al . , 2009 ) . Second , the phenomenon that induces a decrease in SEP fluorescence after stimulation isn ' t , strictly speaking , endocytosis . As highlighted in the previous paragraph , just as clathrin uncoating and vesicle scission are two , temporally distinct , processes , the delay between internalisation and acidification intrinsically limits the temporal resolution of this assay for the study of endocytosis . Attemps to deconvolve the two processes have led to estimates of the actual timecourse of endocytosis leading to a single component rate of A D EMANDING T ECHNOLOGICAL C HALLENGE 93 τ ≈ 15 s in contradiction with direct capacitance measurements ( Atluri and Ryan , 2006 ; Granseth et al . , 2006 ) . A . 3 . Imaging endocytosis at the postsynapse As mentioned in the previous chapter , live cell fluorescence microscopy has robustly shown that stable clathrin structures can be found in close proximity to the PSD in mature neurons ( Figure 37 ) . Interestingly , in neurons cultured for 6 days in vitro , clathrin dynamics resemble those observed in cell lines : some punctae appear and disappear dynamically , with the newly appearing ones occurring in close proximity to a recently disappeared one , and some others are motile punctae that seem to have dissociated from stable ones . At this developmental stage , synapses have not yet fully formed and spines are inexistent . However , after 20 days in vitro ( DIV ) , spines are fully mature and clathrin structures are coincidentally very stable ( Blanpied et al . , 2002 ) . It thus appears that neurons develop ways of organising stable endocytic structures reminiscent of the ' hotspots ' observed in cell lines but so little studied because of their apparent lack of fluctuations in clathrin fluorescence . The pH - sensor pHluorin described in the preceding paragraph has been extensively used to study single TfR , GPCR and AMPAR postsynaptic exocytic events ( Yudowski et al . , 2006 , 2007 ; Wang et al . , 2008 ; Makino and Malinow , 2009 ; Kennedy et al . , 2010 ; Jullié et al . , 2014 ) . No equivalent study has been performed to investigate their endocytosis with such spatial and temporal resolution . However , bulk measurements of SEP - GluA2 fluorescence at the postsynapse after NMDAR activation have been performed . ( Ashby et al . , 2004 ; Lin and Huganir , 2007 ; Mao et al . , 2010 ) . Indeed , application of NMDA increases AMPAR internalisation , which translates into a dramatic drop in SEP fluorescence . The rise back to baseline levels then reflects AMPAR surface recycling by exocytosis ( compare the antagonism between Figure 41B and Figure 42B ) . Figure 42 : Monitoring AMPAR endocytosis ( A ) Timelapse images of a neuron expressing SEP - GluA2 treated with the NMDAR agonist NMDA to induce chemical LTD ( Scale bar 10 µm ) . ( B ) Quantification of the SEP signal from the cell shown in ( A ) . The dramatic decrease in fluorescence is attributed to AMPAR endocytosis . Source : ( Lin and Huganir , 2007 ) However , as pointed out in the previous paragraph , endocytosis and acidification are two , kinetically and biologically distinct phenomena . Following this assertion , the applicability of this pHluorin based assay to monitor AMPAR endocytosis was recently questioned by the observation that NMDAR activation may induce a significant Introduction 94 intracellular acidification ( Rathje et al . , 2013 ) . The extent of SEP fluorescence decrease due to acidification of an already intracellular pool rather than endocytosis from the PM may thus be more pronounced in compartments of large volume containing lots of intracellularly retained AMPARs such as the soma and dendritic shaft as compared to small compartments mostly displaying surface AMPARs such as the spine . These local variations make the interpretation of the results all the more difficult . As underlined in this section , being able to visualise the formation of cargo containing endocytic vesicles unambiguously is an indispensable step towards understanding the spatial organisation and the temporal regulation of endocytosis . However , in order to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the process , one needs more than a mere observation . Interfering with protein function is the next step towards a full comprehension of the machinery at play . B . From visualisation to perturbation A common strategy used to study a biological phenomenon is to prevent it from happening in a loss - of - function approach . The readout of such a procedure can give insight into both how this mechanism is regulated ( " what upstream changes prevented the phenomenon from taking place ? " ) as well as on its roles ( " what downstream changes occurred due to the blockade of the phenomenon ? " ) . Genetic strategies as well as chemical biology approaches have both been used to perturb the dynamics of endocytosis and greatly enhanced our mechanistic insight about how various endocytic proteins recruit their partners to the right place at the right time . In the field of neurobiology , blocking endocytosis is more of a tool to study the effects of such perturbation , either on the dynamics of SV recycling , or on the expression of LTD . In the present section , I shall therefore focus on the various existing strategies to block endocytosis . I shall first describe a few general principles used to specifically disrupt protein function or protein - protein interactions and then concentrate on how these strategies have been applied in cell lines to study the complex chain of events leading to vesicle formation . Finally , I will describe the effects of blocking endocytosis both in the pre - and in the postsynapse . B . 1 . Inhibiting protein function There are two ways of preventing a protein from performing its action in the cell : deleting it and perturbing it . The first approach requires targeted genetic manipulations while the second requires the use of exogenous perturbation factors . Gene knock - out and gene knock - down are well established technologies which respectively permanently deletes a gene from the genome or transiently silences A D EMANDING T ECHNOLOGICAL C HALLENGE 95 it . These approaches prevent the expression of the target protein which will thus be unable to perform its action . However , deleting some genes may be lethal to the organism or , on the contrary , gene silencing may have no observable effect due to the great capacity of biological systems to compensate for functional loss . Moreover , even when a phenotype can be observed , it results from a sustained equilibrium in the new , perturbed , order of cellular function . These limitations may make interpretation of the results somehow difficult but the requirement for many proteins involved in endocytosis was established using such strategies ( Boucrot et al . , 2010 ; Antonescu et al . , 2011 ; Raimondi et al . , 2011 ) . A related approach consists in overexpressing dominant negative mutant proteins lacking their binding ability . This strategy makes it possible to study molecular details at the level of protein domains or even single amino - acids by deleting only the functional element of a protein rather than the protein itself . However , as for the gene knock - down approach , it implies at the very least 24 hours of perturbation to allow for protein expression . It is also possible to acutely disrupt a phenomenon by applying exogenous molecular blockers so as to " switch off " the function of a protein on demand in an otherwise normal organism . The effects of acute perturbation can be monitored in different ways with the great advantage of sometimes making it possible to compare the characteristics of the phenomenon of interest " before " and " after " perturbation . If their mode of action is rapid enough , they can indeed be applied during the course of an experiment and show measureable effects within minutes or seconds . They may also allow for dose - dependent graded effects and , ideally , have a reversible action . Exogenous molecules displaying such activities come in two flavours : small molecules and biomimetic ligands . Small molecules refer to small molecular weight organic compounds that often have the ability to cross biological membranes . Small molecule inhibitors may be found by chance but at the risk of lacking specificity . Directed strategies on the other hand often rely on the screening of large chemical libraries for a chosen characteristic . Additionally , hit compounds may be optimised further by rational design , based on available structural information about the target protein . In the field of endocytosis ( Figure 43 ) , the first , fortuitously discovered , small molecules used to inhibit CME were amphiphatic cationic drugs such as chlorpromazine , but these were rapidly shown to have complex , non - specific effects on phagocytosis , enzyme activity ( Elferink , 1979 ) and the various clathrin dependent cellular processes ( Wang et al . , 1993 ) . Much effort has thus been put in targeted inhibition . Screening for a molecule perturbing the GTPase activity of dynamin has led to the discovery of dynasore ( Macia et al . , 2006 ) and its further improved derivatives DD - 6 , DD - 10 ( Lee et al . , 2010 ) and Dyngo ( McCluskey et al . , 2013 ) , while screening for clathrin interactors resulted in the generation of Pitstops ( von Kleist et al . , 2011 ) . Introduction 96 Figure 43 : Small molecule inhibitors of endocytosis Source : ( von Kleist and Haucke , 2012 ) Biomimetics refer to the imitation of natural systems to inspire human made designs and tools . In the context of protein - protein interaction inhibitors , it consists in designing a ligand that mimics part of the endogenous interaction site of one of the interacting partners ( Figure 44A ) . As described in the first chapter , endocytosis heavily relies on protein - protein interactions to proceed . It is thus possible to compete with these endogenous interactions by using a bait to sequester one of the interacting partners . The size of the part being mimicked to become such a bait may vary greatly , ranging from entire isolated domains to peptides a few amino - acids long . In the field of endocytosis , both approaches have been widely used . Entire protein domains such as the SH3 domains of amphiphysin ( Wigge et al . , 1997 ) or endophylin ( Gad et al . , 1998 ) and the clathrin - β - propeller ( Jockusch et al . , 2005 ) have been used to prevent the recruitment of dynamin or other accessory proteins to endocytic sites . Also , small interfering peptides derived either from the β - appendage of AP - 2 ( Jockusch et al . , 2005 ) , the PRD of dynamin ( Shupliakov , 1997 ) or the PRD of synaptojanin ( Llobet et al . , 2011 ) have been designed to prevent the recruitment of accessory proteins , of amphiphysin or of endophilin respectively . One limitation of the peptide based perturbation strategy is that it relies on a 1 to 1 competition between the ligand and the protein it mimics against the target protein . Yet , the regulation of endocytosis is typically governed by multiple small affinity interactions which stepwise drive the pathway from one state to another . For example , the fact that both dynamin and SH3 - and BAR - domain containing proteins form dimers , and even higher order oligomers , surely translates into an increase in the avidity of their A D EMANDING T ECHNOLOGICAL C HALLENGE 97 interaction . This characteristic may make it difficult for monovalent , low affinity peptides to compete with endogenous , high avidity interactions . Interestingly , the disruptive efficiency of biomimetic ligands can be greatly enhanced when competing with multimeric interactors by increasing the valency of the interfering ligand . This was true for the inhibition of SH3 - PRD interactions between Grb2 , a protein containing 2 SH3 domains , and a signalling protein called Sos ( Cussac et al . , 1999 ; de Mol et al . , 2013 ) . The same principle was used to disrupt the interaction between AMPAR complexes and PSD - 95 in neurons ( Sainlos et al . , 2011 ) ( Figure 44B ) . However , this approach has never been used to inhibit the interaction of oligomerised dynamin with any of its partners . Figure 44 : Principles of biomimetism to inhibit protein - protein interactions ( A ) i . ) The NMDAR normally interacts at its C - terminus with two of the PDZ domains of PSD95 . This interaction can be disrupted using biomimetic ligands mimicking either ii . ) the C - tail of the NR2B ( TAT - NR2B9c ) , thereby sequestering PDS95 or iii . ) the PDZ domains 1 and 2 of PSD95 ( pTAT - PDZ1 - 2 ) , thereby sequestering NMDARs . ( B ) The AMPAR is natively found complexed with several TARPS . The TARP stargazin normally binds to two of the PDZ domains of PSD95 . This interaction can be disrupted using a divalent biomimetic ligand that mimics two stargazin C - tails ( red ) but not with a monovalent one that would mimic a single tail . Source : adapted from ( A ) ( Aarts et al . , 2002 ) ; ( B ) ( Sainlos et al . , 2011 ) The next two paragraph will describe in further detail how these principles of protein perturbation have been used to permanently or acutely inhibit endocytosis in living cells . B . 2 . Blocking endocytosis in cell lines The various endocytic pathways can be inhibited by a number of treatments ( for review , see ( von Kleist and Haucke , 2012 ) and ( Dutta and Donaldson , 2012 ) ) . Few are specific of a single pathway . Typically , treatments affecting membrane properties , e . g . actin inhibitors ( Lamaze et al . , 1997 ) , or overall cell physiology , e . g . K + depletion or Introduction 98 application of high sucrose solution ( Carpentier et al . , 1989 ) , will block most of the endocytic pathways , as well as other cellular functions . Genetic manipulations , small molecules and biomimetics therefore have been preferentially used to achieve molecular specificity by directly targeting the action of the major molecular players of CME : clathrin , AP - 2 , BAR - domain containing proteins and dynamin . It should however be noted at this point that inhibiting AP - 2 may be the only pathway - specific strategy to block CME . Indeed , clathrin is not only involved in CME but also in the formation of post - Golgi vesicles and in cargo sorting at the level of endosomes . Similarly , dynamin is also involved in caveolin and probably CLIC / GEEK endocytosis . Nevertheless , having specific inhibitors of these two major actors of CME has proved widely informative . Knock - down of AP - 2 subunits has repetitively been shown to strongly block transferrin uptake . The first such approach initially proposed that AP - 2 was not essential for CME to proceed but was rather a TfR - specific adaptor protein ( Motley et al . , 2003 ) . It was however later demonstrated that the action of AP - 2 is very robust and that even in cells depleted of 90 % of their AP - 2 content , the still forming CCPs did contain trace amounts of it ( Boucrot et al . , 2010 ) . In any case , AP - 2 knock down allows for the deciphering of AP - 2 dependent and independent molecular recruitment patterns . For example , ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) showed that proteins such as FCHo , eps15 and intersectin can cluster at the PM without AP - 2 whereas clathrin cannot . An elegant variation on AP - 2 knock - down , termed " knock - sideways " by the authors , specifically enabled the acute removal of AP - 2 from the plasma membrane ( Robinson et al . , 2010 ) . To do so , they rerouted AP - 2 from the PM to the mitochondrial membrane by a technology known as rapamycin induced heterodimerisation . Within a few tens of seconds after rapamycin application , endocytosis was inhibited . However , this technology , despite showing interesting results about the acute perturbation of AP - 1 and post - Golgi sorting , did not provide any further insight in the mechanism of action of AP - 2 than classical knock - down approaches . Deletion or point mutants of AP - 2 also improved our understanding of the physiological relevance of , for example , the β2 - appendage in binding to the PM versus binding to clathrin ( Edeling et al . , 2006 ) . To date , no small molecule interfering with AP - 2 function has been reported . Knock - down of clathrin has often been used to decipher the entry route of various cargos ( Hinrichsen et al . , 2003 ; Sigismund et al . , 2008 ) . However , the fact that such a manipulation requires several days of clathrin silencing raises the problem of compensatory effects . Some cargos could indeed be re - routed to alternative entry pathways upon perturbation even though their normal entry route is via CME ( Bitsikas et al . , 2014 ) . Also , a defect of internalisation observed at the PM could in fact reflect an altogether perturbed trafficking machinery , starting with clathrin dependent vesicle budding from the TGN . Acute perturbation of clathrin function should therefore be a better approach to answer such questions . However , specific small molecule clathrin inhibitors have long been inexistent . ( von Kleist et al . , 2011 ) recently reported Pitstops , two small molecules which disrupt clathrin terminal domain interactions with A D EMANDING T ECHNOLOGICAL C HALLENGE 99 amphiphysin or other clathrin binding proteins without affecting amphiphysin binding to AP - 2 nor dynamin GTPase activity . Incubating cells with these molecular blockers induced a strong slowing down of the internalisation process , thus demonstrating that interactions with the terminal domain of clathrin are important at all stages of the pathway ( Figure 45 , top ) . However , off - target effects of Pitstop 2 , the cell permeable variant of the two , were reported soon after ( Dutta et al . , 2012 ) . Finally , sequestration of clathrin by over - expression of fragments or full length auxilin and AP - 180 has been observed in cell lines ( Zhao et al . , 2001 ) . Interestingly , the authors note that over - expression of other full length clathrin binding proteins such as amphiphysin and AP - 2 does not inhibit CME . They suggest that such inhibition would be specifically mediated by monomeric clathrin interactors . The fact that many proteins involved in CME are multimeric probably underline their propensity to bind polymerised rather that cytosolic clathrin therefore preventing them to act as baits upstream of pit formation . Figure 45 : Interfering with clathrin or dynamin perturbs the pathway at different stages Cells treated with Pitstop2 show profiles reflective of all stages of CME whereas cells treated with dynasore accumulate late omega shaped endocytic profiles reflective of the role of dynamin in vesicle scission . Scale bars : ( Top ) 200 nm ; ( Bottom ) 100nm . Source : ( Top ) ( von Kleist et al . , 2011 ) , ( Bottom ) ( Macia et al . , 2006 ) The identification of dynamin as the protein responsible for the shibire paralytic phenotype and its action at the very last step of the endocytic process has made it a target of choice for inhibiting endocytosis . Even though its precise mode of action has long remained elusive , it rapidly became clear that the GTPase activity of dynamin was key to its function . Overexpression of a dominant negative , GTP - deficient mutant dynamin ( dyn K44A ) in cell lines was the first perturbation to be reported and characterised ( van der Bliek et al . , 1993 ; Damke et al . , 1994 ) . These studies showed that dynamin GTPase activity is important at both intermediate and late stages of endocytosis , leading this group to later propose a dual function of dynamin as an endocytic checkpoint for CCP assembly as well as its role in membrane fission ( Loerke et al . , 2009 ; Aguet et al . , 2013 ) . Genetic knock - down of dynamin has proved difficult to interpret . While dynamin 2 was initially believed to be ubiquitous and dynamin 1 and 3 neuron specific , ( Ferguson et al . , 2009 ) showed that in the absence of dynamin 2 in fibroblasts , dynamin 1 could partially take over , illustrating some form of functional redundancy between these two isoforms , as well as the risks of compensation due to Introduction 100 long lasting perturbations . The first chemical compound used to acutely inhibit dynamin ' s GTPase activity was dynasore ( Macia et al . , 2006 ) ( Figure 45 , bottom ) . This compound and its derivatives have since then been extensively used to demonstrate dynamin ' s involvement in various processes ( Nankoe and Sever , 2006 ; Masilamani et al . , 2008 ; Miyauchi et al . , 2009 ; Yamada et al . , 2009 ; Seil et al . , 2012 ) but recent studies using them in dynamin 1 , 2 and 3 knock - out mice or in dynamin knocked - down cells put in question the specificity of their mode of action ( Park et al . , 2013 ; Preta et al . , 2015 ) . Preventing dynamin from interacting with its SH3 containing protein partners is another efficient strategy to block endocytosis . Early experiments expressing truncated forms of dynamin indeed demonstrated the necessity of its PRD domain for the proper targeting of Dynamin to CCPs ( Shpetner et al . , 1996 ) . Soon after , overexpression of isolated SH3 domains revealed differences between the various dynamin interactors and highlighted the importance of amphiphysin in CME ( Wigge and McMahon , 1998 ; Owen et al . , 1998 ; Farsad et al . , 2003 ) . B . 3 . Blocking endocytosis in neurons : overall perturbation Inhibiting endocytosis in neurons has been a potent way of studying the recycling of SVs at nerve terminals . Genetic manipulations have of course been performed in those cells . At hippocampal synapses , the kinetics of endocytosis can be dramatically slowed by transient clathrin ( Granseth et al . , 2006 ; Zhu et al . , 2009 ) or AP - 2 ( Kim and Ryan , 2009 ) knock - down . The fact that AP - 2 depletion does not completely block SV recycling may be explained by the fact that neurons also express specific adapters such as AP - 180 and stonins . Knock - down of AP - 180 reduced the size of the SV cluster , implying a defect in endocytosis after vesicle release ( Petralia et al . , 2013 ) whereas knock - out of stonin 2 doesn ' t inhibit SV endocytosis but impairs the sorting of cargos such as synaptotagmin 1 ( Kononenko et al . , 2013 ) . Interestingly , in Drosophila models , loss of amphiphysin does not display a significant endocytic phenotype ( Leventis et al . , 2001 ) whereas loss of endophilin strongly impairs it ( Verstreken et al . , 2002 ) suggesting an important role of endophilin for SV retrieval . Yet , drosophila and vertebrate amphiphysin do not localise in the same compartment and amphiphysin knock - out mice did exhibit decreased rates of SV endocytosis in cortical neuron preparations ( Di Paolo et al . , 2002 ) , adding to the complexity of the molecular regulation of this process . Finally , knocking out the various dynamin isoforms in neurons revealed both some functional redundancy between dynamin 1 and dynamin 2 , as it is the case in fibroblasts , and some overlapping roles of dynamin 1 and 3 . Indeed , while dynamin 1 was believed to be mostly presynaptic and dynamin 3 postsynaptic , dynamin 1 and dynamin 3 knock - out phenotypes add - up in the presynapse , suggesting a distinct role of dynamin 3 in this compartment ( Raimondi et al . , 2011 ) . Impressively , very few studies , if any , have documented in detail the effects of those knock - out and knock - down experiments on postsynaptic receptor trafficking . Notably , ( Raimondi et al . , 2011 ) observed that in dynamin 1 and 3 knock - out cortical neurons , PSD - 95 labelling remained unchanged as compared to wild - type . A D EMANDING T ECHNOLOGICAL C HALLENGE 101 Despite the large number of studies based on genetic manipulations , the timing of endocytosis with regards to stimulation of the nerve terminal is such a crucial question that acute perturbation is generally favoured . Because many endocytic pathways coexist in the synaptic terminal , blocking SV recycling is a common proof of concept experiment when characterising new specific endocytosis inhibitors . Targeting clathrin with Pitstops showed that blocking CME in neurons at rest did not appear to alter the number of SVs but that blocking it in stimulated neurons prevented the normal recovery of SVs ( von Kleist et al . , 2011 ) . Similarly , targeting dynamin with dynasore ( Newton et al . , 2006 ) or its analogue dyngo - 4a ( McCluskey et al . , 2013 ) in stimulated neurons showed that dynamin was involved in both clathrin mediated and bulk endocytosis . However , high connectivity between neurons as well as the need to decipher pre - from postsynaptic effects on synaptic transmission has somehow reduced the use of these bath applied , cell permeable small molecules , unless the obtained results are comparable to others obtained by a different blocking strategy ( Hosoi et al . , 2009 ; Di Biase et al . , 2011 ; Pougnet et al . , 2014 ; Glebov et al . , 2015 ) . This need to ensure cellular specificity has prompted neuroscientists to use domain or biomimetic peptide injections a lot more than was done in cell lines . B . 4 . Blocking endocytosis in neurons : the presynapse Gaining access to the cell interior by breaking in the membrane using the tip of a thin glass capillary has been common know - how for neuroscientists ever since the invention of patch - clamp electrophysiological recordings ( Hamill et al . , 1981 ) . Because the cell cytoplasm becomes continuous with the recording solution found in the patch pipette , it allows control of the intracellular composition of the cell . In most studies using electrophysiology , this solution is prepared so as to mimic the composition of the cytoplasm . However , it can also be modified so as to diffuse a perturbing factor inside the cell and study its effect . For example , replacing GTP by its non hydrolysable homolog GTP - γS will affect the activity of all GTPases in the cell , including dynamin , thus preventing it from scissioning vesicles from the PM ( Takei et al . , 1995 ) . Similarly , adding a calcium chelator to this solution will help decipher the involvement of calcium in such processes as exo - and endocytosis ( Wu et al . , 2009 ) . However , much larger molecules such as protein domains and peptides can also be dialysed . Together with microinjection , a technique used to rapidly inject some material inside a cell ( Celis , 1984 ) , cell dialysis has been used to deliver constructs of interest within a single cell with good kinetics . Once recovered from the microinjection , cells can be imaged with EM to analyse the morphological consequences of the induced perturbation . Complementarily , cell dialysis can be performed while simultaneously measuring membrane capacitance or other parameters . Introduction 102 To my knowledge , domain injection of AP - 2 has not been tested to sequester proteins involved in CME despite its undeniable role as an interaction hub in CME . Dialysis of the entire clathrin TD in retinal bipolar neurons showed that clathrin binding proteins were implicated in the slow , but not the fast mode of SV retrieval after stimulation ( Jockusch et al . , 2005 ) . The importance of SH3 domain containing proteins in correctly recruiting dynamin to CCPs was actually demonstrated at the presynapse before being confirmed in cell lines . Indeed , injection of the SH3 domain of amphiphysin ( amph - SH3 ) in the giant lamprey synapse showed a dramatic activity dependent accumulation of arrested CCPs blocked in a constricted state all along the membrane of the periactive zone . Interestingly , dynamin could not be observed at the neck of these invaginations , consistent with the idea that amph - SH3 sequestered it in the cytosol and prevented its proper recruitment for vesicle scission ( Figure 46A ) . Functionally speaking , synaptic transmission from amph - SH3 injected terminals was normal under relatively weak stimulation whereas it was markedly impaired under intense stimulation , suggesting that the maintenance of a recycling pool of SVs is necessary for sustained release ( Shupliakov , 1997 ) . Injection of the SH3 domain of endophilin ( endo - SH3 ) had similar but somehow different effects from the injection of amph - SH3 . Endocytosis was indeed blocked at a similarly constricted state after stimulation , also in the periactive zone , but electron - dense collars , believed to be essentially made of dynamin , were observed ( Figure 46B ) ( Gad et al . , 2000 ) . This may suggest that endophilin is necessary for dynamin ' s action in vesicle scission but probably not for its recruitment at CCPs . Figure 46 : SH3 - domain interactions are necessary for vesicle scission ( A ) Injection of amph - SH3 leads to the accumulation ( left ) of constricted but non collard ( right ) CCPs whereas ( B ) injection of endo - SH3 leads to the accumulation ( left ) of constricted collard ( right ) CCPs . Source : adapted from ( A ) ( Shupliakov , 1997 ) ; ( B ) ( Gad et al . , 2000 ) An attractive advantage of using peptide interference rather than entire domains is that they allow for greater molecular specificity . Indeed , many proteins harbour clathrin binding motifs and therefore would have been sequestered by injection of the clathrin TD . Peptides are also much smaller . First , this means that steric hindrance will be less pronounced when peptides bind to their target , leaving the remaining of the protein fully available to engage in other interactions than the targeted one . Second , it allows for more rational optimisation and engineering as will be illustrated in the next paragraph . Based on precise biochemical data that defined interaction motifs between two protein partners , many peptides have been designed to interfere with protein - protein interactions involved in CME ( Table 1 ) .

The D15 and DNF peptides , sequestering dynamin or AP - 2 respectively , have then often been used to demonstrate that CME is responsible for the slow , but not the rapid phase of SV recycling in various model synapses ( Jockusch et al . , 2005 ; Wu et al . , 2010 ; Hosoi et al . , 2009 ) . On the other hand , PP19 , interfering with endophilin recruitment , did impair rapid endocytosis , highlighting molecular distinctions in the regulation of those two pathways ( Llobet et al . , 2011 ) . B . 5 . Blocking endocytosis in neurons : the postsynapse As illustrated in the previous paragraph , blocking endocytosis specifically at the presynapse has extensively been used as a tool to decipher the molecular mechanisms regulating clathrin dependent and independent endocytosis at synaptic terminals . The complexity of the combined pathways as well as the trigger provided by stimulation have made this compartment an insightful model for the cell biology community to study membrane trafficking . However , these inhibitory strategies provided little functional readout in terms of modulating synaptic strength since any perturbation of exo - or endocytosis in the presynapse alters synaptic transmission altogether . Somehow , studies making use of those tools in the postsynapse have followed a different path . The molecular machinery involved in postsynaptic endocytosis has been much less debated upon , but the functional consequences of its blockade is almost always translated in its effect on synaptic transmission and especially Introduction 104 on synaptic plasticity . In other words , much of our understanding relies on a receptor - centric view of the postsynapse , with endocytosis being one of the many regulatory mechanisms controlling its distribution . As mentioned above , very few studies using genetic knock - out or knock - down have focused on the post - synapse . Overexpression of the dyn K44A dynamin mutant was the first perturbation strategy used to identify dynamin as being involved in this mechanism ( Carroll et al . , 1999 ) . Soon after , the same group characterised the functional consequences of perturbing dynamin ' s action at hippocampal synapses by using the D15 peptide inhibiting the dynamin - amphiphysin interaction ( Lüscher et al . , 1999 ) . As illustrated in Figure 47 , blocking endocytosis in a neuron at rest enhances basal synaptic strength , establishing that AMPARs internalise constitutively . They also demonstrated that while AMPARs could not internalise , LTD could no longer be induced . Figure 47 : Effect of D15 on synaptic transmission and plasticity Dialysis of the peptide D15 in a postsynaptic neuron ( A ) induces an increase in the basal amplitude of AMPAR mediated EPSCs ( black circles ) and ( B ) prevents the induction of LTD ( white circle ) as compared to a control scrambled peptide ( S15 , white squares in ( A ) and ( B ) ) after low frequency electrical stimulation ( LFS ) . Scale bars ( insets ) : 40 pA / 20ms Source : adapted from ( Lüscher et al . , 1999 ) Another approach to perturb AMPAR endocytosis has been to disrupt protein - protein interactions involving the receptor itself . Peptides mimicking the C - terminus of GluA2 in the region interacting with PICK1 and GRIP have been shown to reduce , but not abolish , LTD , suggesting a role for these proteins in regulating the extent of synaptic depression . Furthermore , phosphorylation of one of these peptides was shown to preferentially bind to PICK1 and had the same effect on LTD but additionally increased basal synaptic transmission , arguing in favour of a model where GluA2 becomes phosphorylated upon LTD induction ( Chung et al . , 2000 ; Kim et al . , 2001 ) . Another study used peptide interference to directly perturb the interaction between AMPARs and the canonical endocytic machinery after discovering an atypical interaction motif between GluA2 C - tail and the μ2 subunit of AP - 2 . Interestingly , this motif in gluA2 C - tail shows some sequence homology with the non canonical AP - 2 interacting motif of A D EMANDING T ECHNOLOGICAL C HALLENGE 105 synaptotagmin 1 , hinting to a neuron specific internalisation signal ( Kastning et al . , 2007 ) .

Functional studies perturbing interactions between AMPARs and the endocytic machinery have otherwise been favoured to study the regulation of this mechanism . This dichotomy highlights the belief that AMPARs are somehow specifically targeted to otherwise normally active CCPs . One obstacle to studying whether LTD induction may rely on a modulation of CCPs themselves lies in part in our inability to visualise the dynamics of CCV formation in this compartment ( see § A . 3 of this section ) . Another impediment is the obvious discrepancy between the speed at which the whole process is believed to occur ( as little as one minute of NMDAR activation is required to trigger AMPAR endocytosis ) , and the timing required for perturbation and readout ( days of gene knock - down , tens of minutes of peptide dialysis , fixation for immunocytochemistry up to half an hour after treatment… ) . An interesting way to improve our temporal resolution would be to monitor these phenomena in living cells using biosensors to report on cellular function , while perturbing the system within seconds , using photoactivatable endocytosis blockers . Introduction 106 C . All optical monitoring and control Light is a formidable tool for biologists . First , when used appropriately , it is pretty harmless to living cells . Second , few cellular processes are sensitive to light , making it a highly selective device to monitor the behaviour of the molecules they have specifically engineered to acquire this property . Third , its properties such as power and wavelength can be modulated easily . Fourth , its delivery can be rather simply controlled with both great temporal and spatial precision . And fifth , its applications are very versatile , making it usable to both image and perturb protein function . For example light sensitive molecules can either emit light in response to a biological event , so as to visualise cellular mechanisms , or they can become ( in ) active specifically in response to light , so as to modulate cell function on demand . The former category of molecules are known as fluorescence - based biosensors , the latter as photoactivatable molecules . C . 1 . Biosensors Biosensors are extensively used tools to study cellular function by physically or chemically reporting on the concentration of a biological analyte of interest . Genetically - encoded fluorescence - based biosensors are ideal for the real time monitoring of cellular responses during live cell imaging studies ( reviewed in ( Okumoto , 2010 ) ) . For example , the spatio - temporal dynamics of analytes such as calcium ( Zhao et al . , 2011 ) , cyclic AMP ( DiPilato et al . , 2004 ) , chloride ( Jayaraman and Verkman , 2000 ) or glutamate ( Hires et al . , 2008 ) can be monitored in response to various stimulations . As already mentioned , the sensor of choice when studying exo - and endocytosis is superecliptic pHluorin ( SEP ) ( Sankaranarayanan et al . , 2000 ) ( Figure 41 ) . Because of its sharp sensitivity to protons , it can reliably monitor cargo transitioning from the intra - to the extracellular space and vice - versa . The original , and ongoing , goal in developing new fluorescent sensors was to get the greatest dynamic range possible as well as a good signal to noise ratio in order to faithfully report changes in ion concentrations . A good example of this type of optimisation is the development of several generations of the GCaMP calcium sensors , which have been used with increasing success in neuroscience related applications ( Tian et al . , 2012 ) . SEP on the other hand , has been an ideal biosensor being both very bright and very sensitive to protons ever since its initial design 15 years ago . Another demanding and more recent challenge in the field is to widen the spectral palette of available sensors . Indeed , a great number of protein - based sensors were engineered using GFP as a template , thus providing the biological community with plenty of blue light activated , green light emitting biosensors . In order to visualise the interplay between various molecular players in a single cell however , biologists have been in need of sensors of different colours . For example , the development of red - A D EMANDING T ECHNOLOGICAL C HALLENGE 107 shifted calcium sensors , have enabled the dual - colour visualisation of calcium together with secondary messengers involved in calcium triggered signalling cascades ( Odaka et al . , 2014 ; Tewson et al . , 2012 ) as well as calcium signals in two different populations of neurons ( Inoue et al . , 2015 ) . The search for a red - shifted pH - sensor has thus been a long awaited tool for scientists interested in neurotransmitter release and receptor trafficking . A few years ago , ( Tantama et al . , 2011 ) reported a ratiometric red pH - sensor . Their so - called pHRed maximally emits at a wavelength of 610 nm , well separated from the 510 nm peak emission of GFP . However , contrary to SEP which is non fluorescent at low pH values , its fluorescence gets brighter as pH decreases . It is therefore unlikely to be useful as a reporter of trafficking events occurring at the plasma membrane . Also , despite its rather limited dynamic range and small spectral shift , a pH sensitive protein called mOrange2 ( Shaner et al . , 2008 ) was used in combination with green GCaMPs to simultaneously image SV exocytosis and presynaptic calcium transients ( Li et al . , 2011 ) , as well as with SEP to decipher the role of various VAMP isoforms in spontaneous neurtransmission ( Bal et al . , 2013 ) . In the meantime , an exciting paper by ( Li and Tsien , 2012 ) described pHTomato , a new red - shifted pH sensor , emitting at 580 nm , which they report to have a similar pH sensitivity as SEP . They too used it to monitor SV exocytosis and decipher the location and kinetics of calcium transients , both in the pre - and in the postsynapse , with regards to neurotransmitter release . However , none of these tools have yet been tested to monitor the endocytosis of receptors . C . 2 . Photo ( in ) activation When discussing the various ways of perturbing protein function , I mentioned the two major options were either to delete the protein or to prevent it from interacting with its partners . Again , light can be used for both approaches . An interesting alternative to gene knock - downs to acutely inactivate proteins is known as the FlAsH - FALI technology . FALI stands for fluorophore - assisted light inactivation and relies on the production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) when fluorescein is illuminated with intense blue light ( Beck et al . , 2002 ) . FlAsH is a fluorescein - based chemical compound known to bind a tetracystein motif allowing for the specific labelling of any overexpressed protein engineered to harbour this recognition motif ( Griffin et al . , 1998 ) . Thus , the presence of ROS in the immediate vicinity of the targeted protein damages it so as to render it inactive . This technology has been primarily used in drosophila to study the effects of acute inactivation of proteins involved in the SV cycle . Targeting synaptotagmin 1 with FlAsH - FALI has demonstrated that it is involved in the fusion of docked vesicles and not for the docking step itself , a kinetic detail only distinguishable thanks to acute inactivation ( Marek and Davis , 2002 ) . Acutely inactivating clathrin has demonstrated that , in the absence of potential compensatory mechanisms , membrane can be internalised following stimulation but this mechanism is unable to re - generate small diameter SVs capable of further rounds of release ( Heerssen et al . , 2008 ; Kasprowicz et al . , 2008 ) . This is consistent with a crutial Introduction 108 role of clathrin after SV retrieval fom the PM by alternative mechanisms such as kiss and run , bulk and ultrafast endocytosis . Finally , photoinactivation of dynamin gave unexpected results . Indeed , the temperature sensitivity of the shibire drosophila mutant had proved a good tool to acutely inactivate dynamin function for several years ( Poodry et al . , 1973 ) . However , using FLaSH - FALI to target dynamin resulted in a different phenotype . Rather than accumulating arrested CCPs at the nerve terminal , it induced the formation of large membrane vacuoles , reminiscent of the clathrin inactivation phenotype . Interestingly , this approach also showed that dynamin is required for the proper localisation of clathrin and AP - 2 at nerve terminals , thus suggesting an early role of dynamin in CCP formation ( Kasprowicz et al . , 2014 ) . The difference between these two methodologies to affect dynamin may lie in the fact that the mutation in shibire flies only impairs one of its functions , whereas the FALI procedure most probably renders the entire protein inactive . In order to decipher the roles of each particular domain , acute perturbation of specific functions or interactions may thus be preferential . Therefore , in order to acutely perturb protein - protein interactions , without the need for overexpression nor damage , one should be able to photoactivate molecular competitors . Generally speaking , there are two major strategies to render molecules biologically active in response to light : uncaging and photoswitching ( reviewed in ( Brieke et al . , 2012 ) and illustrated in Figure 48 ) . Figure 48 : Major photoactivation strategies ( A ) Uncaging : caged Glutamate can ' t bind iGluRs and induce current in the postsynaptic cell until photolysis of the cage ( hν ) . ( B ) Photoswitching : the ligand binding domain of AMPARs is modified so as to harbour a glutamate molecule ( orange ) at the tip of an azobenzene motif ( red ) . Light induced isomerisation of this motif ( hν ) from the trans to the cis configuration will place glutamate in the ligand binding pocket and induce the conformational switch necessary for the channel to open . Source : adapted from ( A ) ( Judkewitz et al . , 2006 ) ; ( B ) ( Volgraf et al . , 2005 ) These strategies rely on chemical synthesis and engineering to modify a bioactive molecule so as to change its properties in the presence of light . A " cage " refers to a chemical group covalently linked , via a photolabile bond , to the molecule of interest . This modification will render it inactive , either by mere steric hindrance or by shielding A D EMANDING T ECHNOLOGICAL C HALLENGE 109 a reactive functional group or charges necessary for it to interact with its target . Once the cage is removed , the molecule can perform its action . It is thus an irreversible activation ( Figure 48A ) . A photoswitch on the other hand relies on the interesting properties of azobenzenes to allow bidirectional control of the activation . Azobenzenes are indeed structured around an N = N double bond that can isomerise from a cis to a trans configuration by absorbing photons of a particular wavelength . In other words , the two ends of an azo - molecule will be kept close together or set apart reversibly in a light dependent manner ( Figure 48B ) . Both these strategies are compatible with peptide synthesis which makes them interesting to potentially use in combination with peptide - based endocytosis inhibitors as described above ( § B . 4 . of this section ) . Along those lines , the photoswitching strategy has been recently used to develop the so - called " traffic - lights " ( TLs ) , two light - regulated peptides , TL - 1 and TL - 2 , interfering with protein - protein interactions involved in CME ( Nevola et al . , 2013 ) . TL - 1 and TL - 2 were designed to function in an orthogonal way so that TL - 1 would inhibit endocytosis in the dark but not under illumination at 380 nm , whereas TL - 2 would be inactive in the dark and inhibit endocytosis at 380 nm . These interesting tools were based on a peptide mimicking part of the GPCR adaptor protein β - arrestin which was known to interact with the AP - 2 β - appendage ( Edeling et al . , 2006 ) . Even though this peptide had never been tested for its inhibiting ability in vivo beforehand , ( Nevola et al . , 2013 ) showed that incubating cells with TL - 1 did prevent transferrin uptake . However , application of UV light only partially reduces this inhibition . On the other hand , TL - 2 has no effect on endocytosis in the dark but potently inhibits endocytosis after irradiation at 380 nm in Hela cells . Surprisingly , the authors supported this observation for TL - 1 in other cell lines but did not provide such data for TL - 2 , even though it looks more promising both in terms of reversibility in vitro and in inhibiting endocytic activity in HeLa cells . Both TLs however were then extensively characterised regarding their effects on modulating clathrin dynamics . In this regard , TL - 1 in the dark and TL - 2 under UV light both reduced clathrin movements as measured by an increased lifetime and a decreased mobility of clathrin structures . The size of these structures is also increased in TL - 1 treated cells . Considering the potent light - regulated inhibitory effect of TL - 2 , it should prove an interesting tool to decipher the dynamics of endocytosis in neurons with the limitation that the addition of the azobenzene motif renders the peptides cell permeable . This may be an advantage in many application but may make it difficult to decipher pre - from postsynaptic effects when monitoring synaptic activity in the presence of those peptides . 110  In this introduction , I have tried to illustrate the importance of endocytosis in regulating fundamental cellular processes and neurotransmission in particular . Much of our mechanistic and functional understanding of this process relies on studies performed in cell lines as well as in the process of SV recycling at the presynapse in neurons . Important advances in this regard were made possible in living cells thanks to a combination of imaging and electrophysiological recordings , together with means of perturbing protein function and protein - protein interactions involved in CME . Strong evidence points to the absolute necessity of endocytosis at the postsynapse . However , little imaging data , especially in living cells , is available in the literature about this compartment . The static behaviour of clathrin in the postsynapse indeed prevents the direct application of techniques developed in cell lines to study CME at the optical level . As will be exposed in the following of the manuscript , I propose that available methodologies and tools that have been used independently in cell lines and neurons may be combined in relevant ways to circumvent this limitation . Visualising and acutely perturbing CME at the postsynapse may thus open the way to studying the spatial and temporal regulation of AMPAR endocytosis during basal neurotransmission and plasticity induction .  111 Objectives The prime objective of the work presented in this manuscript is to provide new tools to understand the molecular and cellular organisation of CME with particular emphasis on the spatial and temporal regulation of AMPAR trafficking at the postsynapse in basal and under plasticity inducing conditions . Many questions arise from the limitations of the numerous studies performed on the subject . Is the internalisation of AMPARs regulated by receptor properties or by an unknown specialisation of the endocytic machinery ? Could this depend on activity ? If CME itself can be modulated by plasticity , how fast does it occur and does it translate into a sustained modulation , or would this change be transient before other mechanisms take over ? Also , could such regulation be spine specific , or even CCP specific ? In other words , could AMPARs be differentially internalised in specialised endocytic structures ? As of today , no assay enables a direct monitoring of somatodendritic endocytosis with the right spatial and temporal resolution to answer those questions . In order to circumvent these limitations , the aim of my PhD was broken down into a number of secondary objectives : - In order to address the issue of a potential specialisation of CCPs for different receptors , I had to be able to visualise the internalisation of two receptors simultaneously . To this aim , I characterised a new genetically - encoded red - shifted pH - sensor and showed , together with SEP , that it could be used to decipher the differential sorting of receptors in cell lines . - Then , I developed an assay to directly and unambiguously detect the formation of clathrin coated vesicles in living neurons with relevant spatial and temporal resolution . By adapting the pulsed - pH assay so that it could be used in neurons , I visualised the kinetics of internalisation of AMPARs during NMDAR stimulation . - Finally , I turned from visualisation to perturbation of the system . Considering the high compartmentalisation of neurons and the exquisite temporal control required for synaptic function , many of the questions listed above could be answered if endocytosis could be blocked in a chosen location ( e . g . a spine ) or at a chosen time ( e . g . during or after LTD induction ) . I thus worked towards the development of a photoactivatable inhibitor of endocytosis . The combination of these visualisation and perturbation strategies should provide the scientific community with the right tools to study the spatiotemporal dynamics of endocytosis in regulating synaptic transmission . 112 Methodological developments The present section recapitulates the various materials and methods used to perform the experiments that are described in the Results section of this manuscript . However , since the bulk of these methods is also described within the articles composing that section , greater focus will be granted here on underlining what led us to the choices we made as well as on the technical aspects that have required in - house development and validation . As described in the introduction , the issue of understanding how endocytosis is molecularly regulated , in cell lines as well as in neurons , may be addressed by monitoring the dynamics of endocytic vesicle formation in various contexts . To this aim , the methodological developments I have achieved throughout my PhD focused on the one hand on visualising vesicle formation and on the other hand , on perturbing the endocytic machinery . According to the arguments put forward earlier in this manuscript ( Chapter 4 , § A . 1 ) , TIRF microscopy associated with the pulsed - pH assay is arguably one of the most sensitive and unbiased existing imaging methods to detect the formation of cargo loaded endocytic vesicles . Moreover , achieving an acute and efficient disruption of such a dynamic process within a single cell may only be possible via cell dialysis ( Chapter 4 , § B . 4 and § B . 5 ) and photoactivation ( Chapter 4 , § C . 2 ) . Therefore , the leading line of the technological developments presented here has been to explore variants of the pulsed - pH protocol and combine it with patch - clamp based cell dialysis and photoactivation . C ELL C ULTURE 113 C ELL C ULTURE A . Cell lines A . 1 . Choosing NIH - 3T3 cells among others TIRF imaging can and has been performed for the study of endocytosis in many cell lines such as HeLa , SKMEL , BSC - 1 , MEF etc . Those cells present the advantage of growing large , flat lamellipodia , thus making observation of the membrane closest to the glass coverslip very easy . On the other hand , electrophysiology on cell lines has historically been performed mostly on HEK cells overexpressing a channel of interest because of their round , easy to patch , shape . Historically , the pulsed - pH assay has been developed in NIH - 3T3 cells ( European Collection of Cell Cultures , Figure 49 ) . We found that these cells displayed the right intermediate shape allowing TIRF imaging over a decently large adherent surface , as well as being round enough to be patched with a good success rate . Figure 49 : NIH - 3T3 cells in culture http : / / www . lgcstandards atcc . org / ~ / media / 753F4BAFA10440EC85DE570F6DCC70AA . ashx However , the human carcinoma cell line HeLa was also used for other projects where patching was not required . For instance , when using human transferrin as a ligand for the endogenous transferrin receptor . Also when working on a collaborative project , presented in the Results section , with the group of A . Echard ( Pasteur Institute , France ) , who kindly provided us with those cells . Finally , when characterising the red pH - sensitive probe pHuji for which co - transfection of the β2 adrenergic receptor together with the transferrin receptor proved impossible in NIH - 3T3 cells . A . 2 . Maintenance NIH 3T3 were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 1 % sodium pyruvate , 1 % glutamate , and 10 % fetal calf serum ( Invitrogen ) . HeLa cells were cultured in the Methodological Developments 114 same supplemented medium with the addition of 1 % penicilin / streptomycin . Cell were incubated at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 until use and subcultured every 2 to 4 days for maintenance . A . 3 . Transfection Overexpression of fluorescent proteins of interest was achieved by transfecting the cells 24 to 48 hours prior to imaging with DNA plasmids . For each overexpressed protein , care was taken to find the right balance between sufficient fluorescent signal to allow for proper imaging and reasonable overexpression to diminish potential saturation artefacts . NIH - 3T3 cells are a notoriously difficult to transfect cell line . Best results were obtained using Fugen6 ( Promega ) as the transfection reagent . Some results were however obtained using Lipofectamin2000 ( Invitrogen ) due to the fact that Fugen6 has been temporarily commercially unavailable . HeLa cells were transfected using X - TREMEGene - HP ( Roche ) . All transfection reagents were handled according to the manufacturer ' s recommendations . Routinely , 1 to 2 µg DNA were used . In the case of multiple transfections , no more than 4 to 5 µg total DNA were used . During the course of the study , an NIH - 3T3 cell line stably expressing the transferring receptor fused to super - ecliptic pHluorin ( TfR - SEP ) has been produced . To this aim , a TfR - SEP insert was cloned between the EcoRI and Xbal sites of a pcDNAHygro ( + ) vector . NIH - 3T3 cells were transfected with this plasmid and stably expressing cells were selected by hygromycin resistance . The brightest clones were then sorted by Fluorescence - Activated Cell Sorting ( FACS ) . Three positive clones were grown and tested for use in imaging assays . Unfortunately , their fluorescence was not high enough to obtain comparable results as when using transiently transfected cells in the assay described in Figure 54 . None of the results described in the next section have therefore been performed using this cell line . A . 4 . Seeding 4 to 6 hours after transfection , cells were seeded on 18 mm glass coverslips previously washed with citric acid overnight and sterilised at 240 °C for 8 h . When using NIH - 3T3 cells , coverslips where coated with polylysine ( 0 . 1 mg / mL in borate buffer , pH 8 . 4 ) for better adherence to the glass surface .

In the context of studying hippocampal synaptic plasticity , electrophysiological recording in acute slices is often a method of choice , enabling access to single neurons while maintaining the circuitry of the hippocampus almost intact . However , high resolution imaging is limited in such preparations and the use of TIRF microscopy is impossible . In order to directly compare groundwork data obtained in cell lines with that obtained in neurons , dissociated rat hippocampal neurons in culture were used in this study . B . 2 . The Banker protocol The Banker protocol enables the development of embryonic neurons on top of a glial feeder layer . After a few days in culture , these neurons acquire their polarity and within a couple of weeks , form functional synapses ( Kaech and Banker , 2006 ) . In short , the glial feeder layer ( 25 . 000 cells per 21cm² dish ) was grown in MEM medium supplemented with 10 % horse serum ( Invitrogen ) 14 days before the neurons were being dissected from day 18 embryonic rat embryos of both sexes . Neurons were plated on glass coverslips prepared as for NIH - 3T3 cells at a density of 250 . 000 cells per dish in Neurobasal medium ( Invitrogen ) supplemented with 2 mM glutamine and 10 % B27 ( Gibco ) , Neuromix ( PAA Laboratories ) or SM1 supplement ( Stem Cell ) . The coverslips were maintained such that neurons would face the glial feeder layer thanks to small paraffin dots elevating the glass coverslips above the bottom of the dish . At 3 DIV , cytosine α - D - arabinofuranoside hydrochloride ( AraC , Sigma ) was added at a final concentration of 4 . 2 µM to stop glia growth . Subsequently , 1 . 5 mL of medium was removed from the dish and replaced by 1 . 5 mL of freshly prepared supplemented Neurobasal medium every week , . B . 3 . Transfection Routinely , neurons were transfected after 6 to 8 days in vitro ( DIV ) using Effectene ( Quiagen ) according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . Exceptionally , when mCherry tagged proteins were used , neurons were transfected 24 hours before imaging in order to avoid the formation of mCherry aggregates visible after more than 2 days of overexpression . Special care was taken in those cells to choose those with low levels of overexpression .

T HE S ETUP 117 A . Overview A . 1 . Components Imaging was performed on an Olympus microscope ( initially , an IX71 model , then replaced by an IX83 model ) equipped with an inverted oil objective . As explained in detail in the next paragraph , the inverted objective is necessary for TIRF illumination . It also enables an easy access to the cell preparation with regards to placing the pipette required for fast solution exchange ( Figure 50 , 1 and a ; also see § B . 3 ) , the patch - pipette required for cell dialysis ( Figure 50 , 2 and b ; also see § C . 2 ) and the optical fibre required for uncaging ( Figure 50 , 3 and c ; also see § D . 2 ) . These pieces of equipment were mounted above the sample thanks to micromanipulators ( Figure 50 , 4a and 4b ) . In order to eliminate any source of vibrations that may be transmitted to the patch - pipette , the microscope was mounted on an anti - vibration table . Electronic noise was also kept to low levels by surrounding the setup with a metal cage and grounding all electronic devices found within . Samples were observed with 100x magnification either using an Apochromat 60x objective of numerical aperture 1 . 49 in combination with a 1 . 6x magnifying lens ; or with a 100x objective of numerical aperture 1 . 49 . Samples were mounted in a quick change chamber maintained at close to physiological temperatures by perfusing extracellular solution warmed using a coiled heating device ( Figure 50 , d ) either to 37°C for imaging only experiments or to 32 - 37°C when patching . Excess solution was then discarded through a vacuum pump ( Figure 50 , e ) . Along the discarding tubing system , a drop - breaking system was installed to reduce electrical noise carried by the solution flow ( Figure 50 , 5 ) . In early studies , continuous focus on the sample was achieved manually but after some time , a built - in infrared based autofocus device was included in the IX83 setup . Another late addition came with the installation of an optical fibre ( Prizmatix ) which end was placed in close proximity to the sample using a home - made holder ( Figure 50 , f ) carrying both the application pipette and this fibre . Images were acquired by an EMCCD camera ( QuantEM : 512SC , Roper Scientific ) equipped which a chip cooling system enabling rapid and high quality images . Image acquisition was controlled by the software MetaVue ( Molecular Devices ) . Exposure time was set to 100 ms and gain was manually adjusted so as to collect as much information as possible without reaching signal saturation . Methodological Developments 118 A . 2 . The use of triggers In order to coordinate image acquisition , fast solution exchange , electrophysiological recordings and UV light pulses , a triggering system , controlled by the softaware “Pulse” ( Heka ) , was used . This system relies on the use of transistor - transistor logic ( TTL ) signals that defines the open and closed sates of the various components of the system as input - output signals . Each loop consisted of a 4 s long sequence triggered by the opening of the camera . The various commands ensuing from this trigger are illustrated in Figure 51 . Figure 51 : The triggering paradigm Image acquisition by the camera triggers the opening of the shutter , allowing the sample to be illuminated for 100ms . The closing of the shutter will in turn send a command to the patch amplifier controlled by the Pulse software , which , 100 ms later , will 1 ) turn on the electrovalves responsible for fast solution exchange 2 ) record an eletrophysiological trace for 2 . 5 s in voltage clamp mode and 3 ) when required , turn on the UV light source . Using this paradigm , the pulsed - pH protocol enables the detection , in images taken at pH 5 . 5 , of scission events that have pinched off from the PM within the preceding 2 s interval at pH 7 . 4 . A . 3 . The second setup For imaging only experiments , such as those performed in neurons , a second Olympus IX71 setup was occasionally used . The imaging procedure and the principles of fast solution exchange are the same on this setup as on the one described above with minor differences . First , only single colour TIRF imaging was possible ( see below , § B . 2 ) . Second , the autofocus system ( FocusTrack , Motion X Corporation ) was added externally . Third , the lack of amplifier to centralise the triggering system required the use of a Velleman electronic board to perform the fast solution exchange . Finally , no drop - breaking system was needed . T HE S ETUP 119 B . Imaging B . 1 . Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy Total internal reflection is a physical phenomenon that occurs as a propagating wave hits an interface , i . e . a boundary made of media of two different refractory indices , with a great enough angle . The smallest angle at which total internal reflection occurs is called the critical angle . Below that angle , most of the light is transmitted through the interface and can propagate with a refractory angle in the second medium . Above that angle however , the beam is fully reflected and no light propagates through the new medium . Figure 52 : Definition of the critical angle According to Snell - Descartes’ law ( n 1 . sin  1 = n 2 . sin  2 , where n i are the indices of the media forming the interface such that n 1 > n 2 , and  i are the angles of the incident and refracted beams ) , the critical angle above which total internal reflection can be achieved is  c = arcsin ( n 2 / n 1 ) . Source : Wikipedia Although no light propagates in the second medium , an evanescent wave is being formed at the interface . The characteristic of an evanescent wave , by opposition to a propagating wave , is that the intensity of its electric field decreases with the distance from the interface . Figure 53 : Principle of TIRF illumination applied to biology If the excitation beam hits the glass / water interface at a wide enough angle to be totally reflected , an evanescent wave is created in the medium above the coverslip . This phenomenon enables the excitation of fluorophores closest to the cell membrane . In this example , actin filaments ( red ) and clathrin coated structures ( green ) found in the vicinity of the adherent PM are excited whereas those outside of the evanescent wave are not ( grey ) Source : ( Kaksonen et al . , 2006 ) Methodological Developments 120 When applied to fluorescence microscopy , total internal reflection is achieved such that the interface is composed of the glass coverslip on which the cells are seeded and the aqueous buffer in which they are being maintained . The decaying photons of the evanescent wave illuminate a portion of the sample situated ~ 100 to 200 nm from the coverslip , i . e . in the vicinity of the cellular plasma membrane ( Figure 53 ) . B . 2 . The optical path Samples were excited with a co - aligned laser source ( Cobolt ) . Green emitting fluorophores such as GFP , SEP and Alexa488 were excited with a 473 nm laser . Red emitting fluorophores such as mCherry , DsRed , td - Tomato , pHoran4 , pHuji , pHTomato and Alexa568 were excited with a 561 nm laser . In order to reduce phototoxicity to a minimum , a computer controlled shutter was placed on the excitation path so as to open only when the camera takes an image ( Figure 50 , 6 ; also see § Figure 51 ) . Excitation light then entered an optical fibre through a coupling device and was directed into the TIRF arm of the microscope ( Figure 50 , 7 ) . The beam was then aligned through a series of mirrors , lenses and the objective so as to achieve total internal reflection of the beam onto the glass coverslip . The emitted light reached back into the objective and through a UV - compatible , dual band pass dichroic mirror ( Chroma Technology Corp . ) . Before reaching the camera , a dual - view system ( Roper Scientific ) could be inserted according to need . This beam splitting system enables the separation of green and red emitted lights onto two sides of a single camera chip . On the second setup , excitation light consisted either in a 488 nm laser source ( 20 mW , Coherent ) or in a mercury arc lamp ( Olympus ) combined with MetaVue controlled excitation and emission filter wheels for epi - fluorescence imaging . B . 3 . Fast solution exchange As described in the next chapter , the pulsed - pH protocol and some of its variants developed in the present manuscript have been the method of choice to detect the formation of single endocytic events . On the one hand , high spatial resolution was achieved by using TIRF microscopy as described above . On the other hand , high temporal resolution was achieved by rapidly exchanging extracellular medium around the cell , switching every 2 seconds from a pH 7 . 4 HEPES buffered solution ( HBS ) to a quencher containing solution . A theta glass pipette was placed close to the recorded cell , one way containing HBS , the other containing the quencher solution . These application pipettes were made from borosiliate glass capillaries ( Harvard Apparatus ) so as to have a section of ~ 100 µm at their tip using a Narishige vertical puller ( World Precision Instruments ) . On the other end , each way of the theta galss was connected to electrovalves ( Lee Company , 5 mV ) ( Figure 50 , 8 and g ) with the help of quartz filaments ( custom order to World Precision Instruments ) and plastic tubing . Epoxy glue was used T HE S ETUP 121 to seal the end of the pipette to prevent air from entering the channels . The electrovalves were connected to 10 mL seringes containing the HBS and quencher solutions ( Figure 50 , 9 ) and were controlled by the patch amplifier as described above ( Figure 51 ) . ( Except when indicated , salts were obtained from Sigma Aldrich ) . For cell lines , HBS was prepared with135 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 0 . 4 mM MgCl 2 , 1 . 8 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM D - glucose and 20 mM HEPES . In 2014 , 3 mM Myoinositol , a precursor of phosphoinositides , were also added to the extracellular solutions when performing patch - clamp . This addition was inspired by recording conditions used to study endo - and exocytosis at the calyx of Held ( e . g . ( Forsythe et al . , 1998 ) ) . The pH was then adjusted to 7 . 4 using NaOH and osmolarity was adjusted to ~ 310 - 315 mOsmol / L . If needed , water or NaCl was added to the final solution for such adjustments . For imaging only experiments involving HeLa cells , HBS was supplemented with 2 % v / v fetal calf serum on the day of the experiment . For neurons , HBS was prepared with 120 mM NaCl , 2 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM CaCl 2 , 5 mM D - glucose , 3 mM Ascorbate and 10 mM HEPES . The pH was adjusted to 7 . 4 using NaOH and osmolarity was adjusted to ~ 260 - 270 mOsmol / L . It was then supplemented with 0 . 5 µM TTX and 2 % v / v Neuromix or B27 on the day of the experiment . The original quencher solution MBS was prepared in the same way as HBS but buffered with 20 mM MES instead of HEPES and set to pH 5 . 5 . When testing for the diverse variants of the ppH protocol as described in the following chapter , additives ( transferrin , isoproterenol , amiloride , bromochresol green , bromophenol blue , Trypan , NMDA , glyycine etc… ) were directly added to the buffered solutions connected to the application pipette ( and not in the main HBS bath ) . When characterising the red - shifted pH sensitive protein pHuji , MBS was adjusted to pH5 . 0 instead of pH5 . 5 . C . Cell dialysis and patch - clamp recordings C . 1 . Paradigm NIH - 3T3 cells transfected for 24h with TfR - SEP ( provided by C . Merrifield , Gif - sur - Yvette , France ) and subjected to the ppH protocol were dialysed with a variety of endocytosis blockers . Figure 54 illustrates the principle of cell dialysis as well as gives an overview of the assay used to monitor the efficiency of the dialysed molecules in blocking endocytosis . Methodological Developments 122 Figure 54 : Simultaneous imaging and cell dialysis Throughout the whole experiment , endocytosis is being monitored using the ppH protocol under TIRF illumination ( blue ) . The baseline endocytic activity of the cell is first recorded while the patch pipette is in cell attached configuration during which the cell is overall unperturbed ( green ) . After 5 minutes of such monitoring , the seal is broken in order to reach whole cell configuration and allow the cell interior to be dialysed with a molecule of interest ( red ) . Physiological parameters were moniteres so as to attest to cell vialbility and quality of the seal . C . 2 . Electrical wiring Electrophysiological recordings were achieved by maintaining the patched cell at a constant holding potential of - 60 mV ( voltage - clamp mode ) and measuring current variations occurring through the plasma membrane . These variations were measured between a silver pellet placed in the bath , the reference electrode ( Figure 50 , h ) , and a silver wire , the recording electrode ( Figure 50 , 2 and b ) . When in whole cell configuration , the latter electrode was in direct contact with the cell interior via an intracellular solution filling a patch pipette . The parameters of the vertical puller ( Narishige , World Precision Instruments ) used to obtain these pipettes were adjusted so that the resistance of the pipette alone in solution was below 5 MΩ . The reference electrode was held by a preamplifier ( Figure 50 , i ) which in turn was connected to the main amplifier ( HEKA ) controlled by the Pulse software and centralising the triggering system . C . 3 . Intracellular solution In order to dialyse molecules of interest , in our case endocytosis blockers , inside a single cell while maintaining its integrity , the solution contained in the patch pipette should closely mimic the composition of the cytoplasm . We chose to use potassium as the major cation of the intracellular solution for its importance in regulating endocytosis ( Carpentier et al . , 1989 ) . The initial composition of the T HE S ETUP 123 intracellular solution , called " intra ① " , used for cell dialysis experiments was therefore : 140 mM KCH 3 SO 3 , 2mM KCl , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 and 10 mM HEPES . The ratio of CaCl 2 to EGTA , a calcium chelator , was chosen so as to reach a theoretical free Ca 2 + concentration of 20 nM ( according to calculations made in Maxchelator , http : / / maxchelator . stanford . edu / ) . The pH was adjusted to 7 . 2 using KOH and osmolarity was adjusted to ~ 300 - 305 mOsmol / L . If needed , water or KCH 3 SO 3 was added to the solution for such adjustments . On the day of the experiment , nucleotides were added to this solution to reach 4 mM Mg x ATP and 0 . 4 mM Na x GTP in the final solution . Also , in order to maintain an available pool of phosphates for ATP regeneration , 5 mM Na 2 Phosphocreatine was added prior to the experiment . These supplements were stored 50X concentrated in single use aliquots stored at - 20 °C . After addition of the nucleotides , the intracellular solution was kept on ice for the entire duration of the experiment . Throughout the project , several changes have been brought to the composition of this intracellular solution . These changes were motivated by regular observations that the average endocytic activity of patched cells would run down even under control conditions over long periods of time . Indeed , every day an endocytosis blocker would be tested , 1 or 2 cells would be recorded in the absence of blocker at the beginning and at the end of the day . If these daily controls did not exhibit a stable endocytic activity , the data obtained with the blocker would not be considered either . With the aim of obtaining the most stable recordings possible ( see Figure 55 ) , the following changes have been made : 2011 : intra ② - 20 mM HEPES were used to ensure strong buffering efficiency - KCH 3 SO 3 concentration was reduced to 135 mM to maintain the desired osmolarity 2012 : intra ③ - KCl was replaced by 10 mM NaCl to increase the sodium concentration a little ( so far only coming from the GTP and phosphocreatine containing aliquots ) while maintaining a source of chloride . - KCH 3 SO 3 concentration was reduced to 127 mM to maintain the desired osmolarity 2013 : intra ④ - In a personal communication , we were told that high concentrations of HEPES may be noxious to cells . The concentration was thus taken back down to 10 mM - Inspired from ( Forsythe et al . , 1998 ; Yasuda et al . , 2004 ) and others , we replaced NaCl by 3 mM Na 2 Ascorbate . The anti - oxidative effect of ascorbic acid may help obtaining greater stability in long imaging experiments . 2014 : intra ⑤ - According to suppliers ' storing recommendations , we reasoned that ATP may be more stable as a sodium salt rather than as a magnesium salt . Mg x ATP was therefore replaced by Na x ATP . Methodological Developments 124 - 4 mM MgCl 2 were added in order to compensate for the removal of the previous magnesium source . This addition also reintroduced a source of chloride ions , transiently lost with the replacement of NaCl by Na 2 Ascorbate . - However , it was noted that since ascorbate had been added to the intracellular solution , its pH would vary from pH 7 . 2 to pH7 . 0 within a few days ( while a stock of nucleotide - free intracellular solution could previously be stored at + 4 °C for about a month without noticeable changes in pH and osmolarity ) . Ascorbate was thus finally added as a 50X concentrated aliquot on the day of the experiment together with ATP , GTP and phosphocreatine . Figure 55 : Comparison of the intracellular solutions used in this project The cumulated number of endocytic events as monitored by the ppH protocol during cell dialysis is plotted against time ( see Image Analysis , § B . 1 for details about how such graphs are obtained ) . A straight line would represent a stable endocytic activity throughout the 10 minutes of whole cell recording . A horizontal plateau would represent a total arrest of endocytosis during the assay . The curves obtained for the intracellular solutions intra ① to ⑤ described in the main text are represented in shades of red . The average rundown obtained with intracellular solutions ② to ⑤ are pooled in the green curve . intra ① n = 11 ; intra ② n = 1 8 ; intra ③ n = 12 ; intra ④ n = 20 ; intra ⑤ n = 1 0 ( SEM not represented for clarity ) . The introduction of chloride ions ( from intra ① to intra ③ ) and the further addition of ascorbate ( intra ③ to intra ④ ) greatly enhanced the stability of the endocytic activity throughout the assay . However , for unknown reasons , after a 6 months break in those experiments , the stability of the recordings dropped down again around spring 2014 . Addition of myoinositol to the extracellular solution and use of Mg x ATP instead of Na x ATP ( intra ⑤ ) did not improve this stability back to the 2013 levels ( intra ④ ) . The data presented in the Results section about the various endocytosis blockers tested for this study originate from experiments performed in intra ② to intra ⑤ ( green curve , n = 60 ) . Also , the D15 peptide has been tested for its blocking efficiency in all solutions used . Since its effect on endocytosis was quantitatively comparable in all intracellular solutions the efficiency of the various blockers , even though tested in 4 different solutions , were pooled together and compared as such . For electrophysiological recordings in neurons , the composition of the intracellular solution was 110 mM KCH 3 SO 3 , 2 mM KCl , 1 mM EGTA , 0 . 1 mM CaCl 2 and 10 mM HEPES . 50X concentrated aliquots of Mg x ATP , Na x GTP and Na 2 Phosphocreatine were added on the day of the experiment to a final concentration of 4 mM , 0 . 4 mM and 5 T HE S ETUP 125 mM respectively . The pH was adjusted to 7 . 2 using KOH and osmolarity was adjusted to ~ 240 - 250 mOsmol / L . C . 4 . Parameter monitoring When dialysing NIH - 3T3 cells , three parameters were monitored throughout each recording in order to ensure that the experiment itself did not induce cell death and that the cell dialysis was effectively conducted . A test pulse conducted at the beginning of each 4 s sweep allowed for such monitoring . If either of the following criteria was not respected in the course of the experiment , the recording was not considered as usable data . 1 ) C f ~ constant : As mentioned in the introduction , membrane capacitance is directly proportional to the area of the PM . Some studies therefore rely on capacitance measurements to record single exocytic and endocytic events . In our hands , environmental electrical noise was not reduced enough to make such fine recordings possible . We however monitored the apparent membrane capacitance throughout the recording to ensure that it did not vary dramatically over time , which could have been the sign of gross cell shrinkage or cell swelling potentially reflecting cell death . 2 ) R s < 10 MΩ : The series resistance is directly proportional to the ion flow allowed through the patch pipette . If the pipette is obstructed , typically by membrane if the patch starts to close back in , this parameter will shoot up . It was therefore empirically decided that it should remain below 10 MΩ at all times to ensure that the molecule of interest contained in the intracellular solution reached the cell interior . 3 ) leak > - 100 pA : The leak current in a way reflects the quality of the seal by which the pipette is attached to the cell membrane . In cell attached configuration , the seal is tight and the leak current often in the range of ~ - 10 pA . When entering whole cell configuration , the seal typically loosens and the leak current may increase . We observed that the more the leak current varied from the start to the end of the whole cell recording , the more endocytosis tended to rundown , even in control conditions . We therefore decided that recordings in which the leak current was below - 100 pA should not be considered for analysis . However , this criterion was not strictly followed when GTP - γS was present in the patch pipette . Indeed , the blockade of all GTPases induced by this non hydrolysable metabolite induced an overall membrane depolarisation that made the leak current appear much larger . Methodological Developments 126 D . Uncaging D . 1 . Motivation One major aim of the present study was to develop a photoactivatable blocker of endocytosis . However , the search for a candidate molecule potent enough to block endocytosis at low concentrations , so as to be active despite moderate yields of photoactivation , became a project of its own . Therefore , few attempts of uncaging experiments have been performed in the course of this study . This aim however remained an important criterion for the development of endocytosis blockers , in terms of strategies for chemical synthesis for example ( see § A . 2 p . 139 ) , as well as a driving force for modifications made to the setup . D . 2 . Preliminary experiments A well documented and widely used non - specific blocker of endocytosis is the non - hydrolysable analog of GTP , GTP - γS . In order to set up the parameters required for photoactivation , we used caged - GTPγS , namely DMNPE - GTP - γS . This compound was once commercially available and had been used to study GTPase depend processes such as GPCR activation both in vitro and in cells ( Frace et al . , 1993 ; Blanchet and Lüscher , 2002 ) . It is however unavailable now and we had it custom made ( Jena Bioscience ) . For the preliminary uncaging experiments described in this manuscript , a 200 µm diameter fibre installed in the vicinity of the recorded cell was coupled to a 365 nm LED light source . The entire cell was thus illuminated for 1 s after 5 min of whole cell recording . This 1 s pulse was triggered by the main amplifier and could be made to occur any time within the 4 s of the trigger loop described in Figure 51 . For the experiments described here , the light pulse occurred during the first second , i . e . 100ms after the acquisition of the image at pH 7 . 4 . T HE PP H PROTOCOL A . The 2005 original protocol The pulsed - pH , or ppH , protocol was developed in cell lines almost 10 years ago ( Merrifield et al . , 2005 ) and has proved a very powerful tool to study the molecular mechanisms involved in endocytosis ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . Mostly quoted by the scientific community for its unequalled temporal resolution , it has also given evidence that occasionally , clathrin coated vesicles can actually internalise cargo without major T HE PP H P ROTOCOL 127 changes in the clathrin signal itself . This capacity to directly and unambiguously visualise vesicle formation rather than clathrin dynamics therefore makes it the best imaging protocol to start from to visualise dynamic endocytosis in mature neurons , where clathrin is known to remain optically stable over long periods of time . A . 1 . Description The pulsed - pH protocol is described in ( Perrais and Merrifield , 2005 ) as follows : " A cell expressing LCa - DsRed ( red lines ) and TfR - pHl ( green lollipops , fluorescent ; black lollipops , quenched by protons ) is alternatively bathed in solutions at pH 7 . 4 and pH 5 . 5 . At pH 7 . 4 , TfR - pHl on the plasma membrane and in nonacidic CCVs are visible . At pH 5 . 5 , the fluorescence from nonacidic CCVs is isolated . A CCV formed at pH 7 . 4 will be visible on the next image at pH 5 . 5 . " ( LCa : Clathrin light chain A ; pHl : pHluorin , aka SEP ) The fundamental principle of the ppH assay is therefore to isolate new intracellular signals from the overall extracellular fluorescence every 4 s by exchanging extracellular solution in synchrony with image acquisition . For this purpose , all studies using the ppH protocol have used TfR as a model receptor , SEP as a fluorophore and acidic solution as a quencher of SEP fluorescence . Part of the work of my PhD has been to extend this principle in various ways : by using other receptors than TfR such as β2AR or AMPAR , by characterising new pH - sensitive fluorophores to use in combination with SEP and by optically , rather than chemically , quenching the fluorescence of SEP and other dyes using coloured solutions . A . 2 . New application for a collaborative work I first used the ppH protocol as it is for a collaborative work with A . Echard and C . Cauvin from the Pasteur institute ( Paris , France ) . Similarly to what had been done in ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) for known endocytic proteins , I studied the recruitment profiles of mCherry tagged proteins to characterise the involvement in endocytosis of a new molecular switch that A . Echard and his group have previously proposed to be involved in abscission ( Dambournet et al . , 2011 ) . An abstract of the results obtained from this work is presented in the Results section of this manuscript . Methodological Developments 128 B . Newly developed variants : trials and successes B . 1 . Following single receptor internalisation : quenching Q - dots Quantum - dots have been used extensively in the team of Daniel Choquet and others to follow the dynamics of single receptors on the cellular surface . The intense and long lived fluorescence of these particles make of them an ideal tool to follow receptors over long trajectories without bleaching . Being able to follow a single receptor as it is being internalised , sorted and recycled could be a methodological breakthrough for the study of many cellular processes . This idea was illustrated in ( Park et al . , 2012 ) where the authors track single presynaptic vesicles before their exocytosis and reveal a dependence of docking time on the type of exocytosis ( namely , full collapse and kiss and run ) . In their experimental paradigm , exocytosis was detected as a loss of Quantum - dot fluorescence due to the presence of 1 µM Trypan Blue in the extracellular medium . Also , ( Valentine et al . , 2012 ) studied the internalisation and recycling timecourse of β2AR by quenching QD labelled receptors with 10 µM bromochresol green ( BCG ) . We tested the possibility of following single TfR from internalisation to recycling using a “pulsed - BCG” variant where MBS would be replaced by BCG ( Sigma - Aldrich ) in HBS in the application pipette . Results were however non - conclusive as quenching of QDs was not complete enough within 2 s to fully switch off surface fluorescence and distinguish newly internalised receptor , even in the presence of up to 100 µM BCG . B . 2 . Visualising endogenous receptor internalisation : quenching Tfn - Alex488 Another interesting variation of the ppH protocol would be to be able to visualise the endocytosis of endogenous receptors rather than overexpressed ones . ( Harata et al . , 2006 ) showed that 2 mM bromophenol blue ( BPB ) could be used to quench the fluorescence of EGFP as well as that of organic dies such as FM1 - 43 . Using this propertiy , they provide strong arguments in favour of a pre - synaptic kiss - and - run mechanism . We tested whether Tfn - Alexa488 ( Life Technologies ) could be quenched by BPB ( Sigma - Aldrich ) enough to visualise the internalisation of Tfn in untransfected HeLa cells using a “pulsed - BPB” assay . 5 µg / mL Tfn was present in both lines of the application pipette while 2 to 10 mM BPB was present in one of the two . Imaging was started before opening the valves in order to visualise the accumulation of Tfn on the PM . Tfn - A88 accumulated in clusters at the PM consistent with its concentration at TfR T HE PP H P ROTOCOL 129 containing CCPs . However , quenching of those surface clusters by BPB was not complete enough to distinguish newly internalised Tfn containing veiscles . Also , Tfn rapidly accumulated intracellularly making image segmentation difficult after a few minutes of recording . Finally , it appeared that BPB was membrane permeable . Following the idea that green fluorescence could be quenched optically , we also tried quenching Tfn - Alexa488 with Trypan red or Trypan purple ( Interchim ) . We found that Trypan purple was the best quencher of Alexa488 fluorescence but not sufficiently to robustly detect endocytic events . B . 3 . Induced internalisation : the ppH protocol using β2AR - SEP Thanks to the great temporal resolution of the ppH protocol , we have been able to precisely determine the kinetics of internalisation of the β2AR during agonist application . This is to be opposed to observing intracellular labellings at various timepoints after agonist application which is limited in temporal resolution as well as biased by surface recycling occurring in the time interval ( Valentine et al . , 2012 ) . For those experiments , the plasmid β2AR - SEP ( gift from C . Merrifield , Laboratory of Enzymology and StructuralBiochemistry , Gif - sur - Yvette , France ) was transfected in NIH - 3T3 and HeLa cells 48h or in hippocampal neuron 7 days prior to imaging . The agonist isoproterenol ( Sigma Aldrich ) was used at 20 µM , freshly dissolved in HBS and MBS every 2 hours on the day of the experiment . It was applied on the cells for 10 min after 3 min of baseline recording thanks to a 4 - way perfusion system . B . 4 . Dual colour imaging : the ppH protocol with a red pH - sensor As described in the introduction , a long standing question about the internalisation of AMPARs in neurons is whether they are being endocytosed at dedicated CCPs or whether they do so at the same location as the constitutively recycling TfR . In order to conceptually address this question , we have collaborated with the group of R . Campbell , Alberta , Canada , to develop and characterise two red - shifted pH - sensitive fluorescent proteins which we called pHoran4 and pHuji . The group of R . Campbell provided us with SEP - , pHTomato - , pHoran4 - and pHuji - pDisplay constructs . We tested for the pH sensitivity of the fluorescent proteins in cellulo using HBS , MBS and PiPES buffered saline solutions adjusted from pH 5 . 0 to pH 9 . 0 . We then tested for the possibility of a differential sorting of receptors using the model receptors TfR and β2AR . Using the TfR - SEP DNA template , we made TfR - pHuji and TfR - pHoran4 using Nhe 1 and Age 1 restriction sites and using β2AR - SEP , we made a β2AR - pHuji plasmid using Age1 and Xbal restriction sites . Cells were transfected 48h prior to the experiment and isoproterenol was prepared and used as described above . Methodological Developments 130 C . The ppH on neurons Because the ppH protocol can reveal the endocytic activity of optically stable CCPs , efforts were put in making it usable in cultured hippocampal neurons . It could indeed answer long standing questions about whether CME is locally regulated in the vicinity of synapses upon plasticity induction or whether AMPARs are being actively targeted to otherwise normally active CCPs ( see Chapter 3 , § B . 3 of the Introduction for a discussion on that matter ) . However , before answering those questions , many neuron specific concerns had to be addressed , mostly linked to the use of acidic solution , innocuous in NIH - 3T3 cells but raising questions about the maintenance of normal neuronal function . Also , the photoactivatable blocker of endocytosis we are currently developing will hopefully be used in neurons to answer some of the questions raised in the introduction in the near future . Such a tool would advantageously be used in acute brain slices in which electrophysiological recordings and plasticity induction are best performed . However , in such preparations , the ppH protocol will no longer be usable to monitor the arrest of endocytic activity . In order to validate that this new tool , fully characterised in a cell line , will also be also efficient in blocking endocytosis in the postsynaptic compartment of neurons , it would be convenient to use the ppH protocol or one of its variants in combination with blocker dialysis in cultured neurons first . C . 1 . pH induced currents In order to check whether neuronal physiology was affected by sequential application of acidic solution , electrophysiological recordings of neurons undergoing the ppH protocol were performed . Cells were voltage - clamped at a holding potential of - 70 mV . Currents evoked by low pH solution were recorded and their amplitude at their peak was measured with the software Igor ( Wavemetrics ) . We found that 500 µM amiloride ( Sigma Aldrich ) , a blocker of acid sensing ion channels ( ASICs ) , could prevent the induction of those currents . It was thus added to the HBS and MBS solutions connected to the application pipette when indicated . Overall excitability under amiloride was monitored by measuring AP firing following steps of + 100 to + 300 pA currents . Systematic analysis of this dataset has not yet been performed but amiloride did not dramatically increase nor arrest AP firing enough to be detectable by visual inspection of the traces . C . 2 . The pulsed - Trypan variation Other than cell excitability , surface proteins important for neuronal regulation may also be affected by low pH solution . For example , NMDAR function is T HE PP H P ROTOCOL 131 known to be inhibited when extracellular pH decreases ( Traynelis et al . , 1995 ) . We therefore reasoned that an alternative to the ppH protocol that did not involve the application of low pH solution was needed for experiments where chemical LTD was being induced ( see next paragraph ) . Based on our trials in visualising Tfn endocytosis ( see § B . 2 of this section ) , we used Trypan Purple to alternatively quench SEP fluorescence . We found that TfR - SEP could be more readily quenched than Tfn - Alexa488 in our recording conditions . Considering the quasi - identical spectral properties of Alexa488 and EGFP , this observation may suggest that our failure in quenching Tfn - Alexa488 fluorescence may have been due to a poor accessibility of the fluorophore when Tfn was bound to its receptor . The effect of Trypan on the physiology of neurons was tested as described in the previous paragraph for amiloride . We found that Trypan Purple does not induce any current nor modulate the excitability of the cells . We called this variation of the ppH protocol the “pulsed - Trypan” protocol , or " pTry " . C . 3 . Induction of chemical LTD The term chemical LTD , or chem - LTD , is commonly used to refer to a chemically induced form of synaptic depression . Used in slices , this paradigm has been proposed to have similar effects and share common expression pathways as electrically induced LTD ( Lee et al . , 1998 ) . Surprisingly , assessing by electrophysiological means the extent of synaptic depression after chem - LTD induction in cultured neurons has proved more challenging . Indeed , frequency rather than amplitude of miniature currents appear to be reduced in such preparations ( Beattie et al . , 2000 ) . However , chem - LTD induced removal of AMPARs from the surface of cultured hippocampal neurons has proved a robust phenomenon ( Beattie et al . , 2000 ; Ehlers , 2000 ; Ashby et al . , 2004 ; Lin and Huganir , 2007 ) . Various protocols of chemical LTD have been proposed in the literature , all relying on a partial but prolonged activation of the NMDAR . The simplest protocols consist in applying NMDA for a few minutes ( Lee et al . , 1998 ; Beattie et al . , 2000 ; Ashby et al . , 2004 ) . Other groups reduce the Mg 2 + concentration in the extracellular space to alleviate its blocking effect on NMDARs ( Lin and Huganir , 2007 ; Tao - Cheng et al . , 2011 ) . Finally , som add the NMDAR co - agonist glycine to the preparation ( Rathje et al . , 2013 ) . We tested for the efficacy of these different protocols on an antibody feeding assay and found that all protocols indeed induced an increased internalisation of AMPARs as compared to control . It appeared that the most potent protocol was the one adding glycine in low Mg 2 + conditions ( Figure 56 , data and analysis performed by Anna Tchenio , master student ) . Following these preliminary data , the results presented in the next section of this manuscript , were produced by applying 20 µM NMDA and 10 µM Glycine to HBS containing 0 . 3 mM Mg2 + ( instead of 2 mM ) for 3 min in order to induce chem - LTD on cultured hippocampal neurons . The same solution with an extra 5 mM Trypan purple was used for the pTry variant . Methodological Developments 132 Figure 56 : Induction of chemical LTD ( A ) Neurons were live - stained with a monoclonal mouse anti - GluA2 antibody for 5 min , stimulated with 20 µM NMDA ( bottom ) or not ( top ) for 3 min and further incubated for 5 min at 37 °C . They were then fixed and surface stained with a goat anti - mouse antibody coupled to Alexa488 . They were then permeabilised and intracellular AMPARs were stained with the same antibody coupled to Alexa647 .

Results expressed as percentage of red pixels over the sum of red and green pixels ( total gluA2 ) in segmented images . C . 4 . Visualising AMPAR endocytosis In order to compare the behaviour of TfR and AMPAR upon induction of chem - LTD , we applied the pTry protocol to TfR - SEP and GluA2 - SEP expressing neurons . For this set of experiments , neurons were used between 19 and 22 DIV . To produce the SEP - GluA2 construct , SEP was inserted after the signal peptide of rat GluA2 coding sequence using AgeI / NheI sites and this SEP - GluA2 insert was cloned into the pBI - Tet - on vector ( Clontech ) between the MluI and EcoRI restriction sites . In order to induce the expression of GluA2 - SEP in neurons , the plasmid was co - transfected with a transactivator plasmid ( Clontech ) at 7 DIV and doxicyclin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was added to the culture dish 48h prior to the experiment ( 2µg / mL final concentration ) . As Homomeric GluA2 tetramers appear to be more ER retained than heteromeric AMPARs ( Greger et al . , 2007 ) , we cotransfected unlabelled GluA1 together with SEP - GluA2 for this set of experiments . C on t r o l N M DA Surface GluA2 Internalised GluA2 A B P OST - A QUISITION A NALYSIS 133 P OST - ACQUISITION ANALYSIS Details about the methods used for the detection , selection and quantification of vesicles from data acquired with the ppH protocol are extensively described in the material and methods sections of ( Merrifield et al . , 2005 ; Perrais and Merrifield , 2005 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) and each of the articles ( published and in preparation ) constituting the Results section of this manuscript . Focus will therefore be granted here on the routines developed specifically for the methods developed in this study , i . e . for the detection of pHuji loaded vesicles , for the study of endocytosis in neurons and for the monitoring of frequency rundown upon cell dialysis with endocytosis blocker . A . Multi - dimentional Image Analysis : MIA The raw data acquired with the ppH protocol consists of a stack of images ( also called frames ) taken every 2 seconds , once at pH 7 . 4 , once at pH 5 . 5 . In images taken at pH 7 . 4 , surface clusters of TfR are visible while in images taken at pH 5 . 5 , newly formed intracellular vesicles are visible . We have used a Metamorph routine called MIA ( for multi - dimensional image analysis ) , developed by J - B . Sibarita and using wavelet - based image segmentation , to automatically detect those clusters and vesicles , together referred to as “objects” . MIA was also used to segment CCSs in Clathrin - mCherry transfected neurons when characterising the endocytic activity of these structures in neurons using the ppH protocol . Finally , MIA was used to segment clusters of Homer - TdTomato and define synapses . For these segmentations , the threshold was manually adjusted so as to select , according to the user’s perception , the clusters best representing the raw data ( which quality may have varied depending on transfection efficiency ) . Methodological Developments 134 B . Newly developed Matlab routines B . 1 . Partial quenching of surface receptors We adapted the Matlab routine already used to determine bona fide vesicles from all segmented objects so that it would take into account the partial quenching of the pHoran4 and pHuji sensors at pH 5 . 0 . The selection of these vesicles lies on their complying with a series of criteria . One of them is that objects have to appear de novo in low pH images . The partial quenching of surface clusters however sometimes resulted in a reminiscent signal in those images . We therefore adapted the routine so that objects detected in low pH images that would see their fluorescence increase more than 3 folds in the course of their lifetime would be subjected to the screen for the other criteria together with newly appearing objects . For even more sensitivity in our detection we also , developed another algorithm for which we generated a differential stack of images taken at pH 5 . 0 such that each image was itself minus an average of the five preceding images . Residial fluorescence originating from static surface cluster was thus removed from the images and the detection of isolated intracellular vesicles made possible ( Figure 57 ) Figure 57 : Detection of endocytic events originating from partially quenched surface clusters In NIH - 3T3 cells co - transfected with TfR - SEP and TfR - pHuji , an endocytic event is clearly visible in the green channel in images taken at pH 5 . 0 but the same event , even though discernible by eye , was not automatically detected in the red channel by the original algorithm used in ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . This was due to the presence of a partially quenched surface cluster in the vicinity . Segmentation of images at pH 5 . 0 indeed included the newly appeared event in the same structure as the pre - existing unquenched cluster . Generating a differential stack of images in which background fluorescence originating from this static structure is removed ( pH 5 . 0 diff . ) enabled the detection of the endocytic event unambiguously . B . 2 . Distance measurements For the study of the spatial regulation of endocytosis with regards to synapses , we developed new analysis routines to automatically measure the distance between CCSs and synapses or between endocytic events and synapses . This distance was measured between the centre of an object of interest A ( e . g . an endocytic event ) and P OST - A QUISITION A NALYSIS 135 the closest pixel identified as belonging to an object B ( e . g . a synapse ) . In order to estimate whether this distribution of distances reflected an organised spatial arrangement , we represented it as a cumulative plot and compared it to a randomised dataset of distance distributions obtained by chance . To do so , we generated 1000 sets of n A objects randomly scattered within the cell , where n A is the number of objects A actually detected . We then measured the distance between these randomly localised objects and objects B as described above to obtain a randomised dataset of 1000 distance distributions . Finally , we compared the actual distance distribution of objects A to the envelope of this randomised dataset . Distributions falling within the 95 highest and lowest percentiles of this dataset were considered as not being different from chance ( Figure 58 ) . Figure 58 : Measuring the distance between endocytic events and synapses ( A ) Portion of a cell co - transfected with SEP - GluA2 and Homer1c - TdTomato and subjected to the ppH protocol . From an average image of the cell ' s fluorescence at pH 7 . 4 , we draw a mask of the cell surface by thresholding . From images taken at pH 5 . 5 , we detect endocytic events using the ppH protocol ( arrow ) . Segmentation of those images using MIA determines the coordinates of the centre of this event . From an average of images taken in the red channel , we visualise synapses . Segmentation of this image identifies the presence of a PSD . We then measure the distance between the centre of the detected event ( green cross ) and the closest Homer positive pixel . ( B ) When the randomised dataset of chance distributions is generated , a condition is set such that randomly scattered events fall within the mask of the cell surface defined as in A . The mean distribution of this dataset is represented as a solid black line and the 95 th percentiles are shown in grey . ( Left ) A fictive distribution of distances for which objects A would be considered as enriched in the vicinity of objects B . ( Middle ) A fictive distribution of objects A considered as randomly scattered regardless of the presence of B . ( Right ) A fictive distribution of distances for which objects A would be considered as excluded from the vicinity of objects B . Vertical lines show the threshold at 300 nm used for dividing objects A into adjacent to ( equal or less than 300 nm ) or far from ( more than 300 nm ) objects B . Methodological Developments 136 B . 3 . Quantifying the frequency of endocytic events In order to compare the efficacy of various blockers of endocytosis , we wrote a Matlab routine to quantify and normalise the rundown of a cell’s endocytic activity induced by the dialysis of these blockers . For each cell , the frequency of detected events in cell - attached and whole - cell recordings was plotted in cumulative curves . These plots were then normalised to the number of events detected up to the last frame of cell attached recording ( also called basal endocytic activity ) . In these normalised plots , each cell thus displayed 100 events on the 70 th frame of their cell attached recording . Cells submitted to the same treatment could hence be pooled together despite great variability in their absolute basal endocytic activity . The efficacy of the endocytosis blockers was deduced for each cell as the ratio of the frequency of events occurring in the last two minutes of the whole - cell recording over the frequency of events in the first two minutes of cell - attached recording . This ratio was then averaged over all cells dialysed with the same blocker to provide a quantitative measure of its blocking efficiency . Figure 59 : Normalisation procedure and quantification of the efficacy of endocytosis blockers ( A ) For each cell analysed using the ppH protocol , the number of endocytic events detected during the cell attached ( black curve ) and whole cell ( grey curve ) recordings was plotted against time and normalised to 100 five frames before the end of the cell attached recording ( 280 s , orange lines ) . We then determined the remaining endocytic activity by calculating the ratio of the frequency of events occurring in the last two minutes of the whole - cell recording ( red highlight ) over the frequency of events in the first two minutes of cell - attached recording ( green highlight ) ( F WC / F CA ) ( B ) Cells subjected to the same treatment ( in this example , untreated cells ) are pooled together . ( C ) The inhibitory efficiency of a treatment is quantified as 100 - ( F WC / F CA ) C HEMICAL B IOLOGY 137 C HEMICAL B IOLOGY A . Peptide synthesis A . 1 . Design As discussed in the introduction ( chapter 4 , § B . 4 and § B . 5 ) , the peptide D15 had been widely used to disrupt the interaction between dynamin and amphiphysin therefore leading to an arrest of endocytosis in living cells ( Grabs et al . , 1997 ; Shupliakov , 1997 ; Owen et al . , 1998 ; Lüscher et al . , 1999 ) . Considering the compatibility of a number of caging strategies with peptide synthesis , we reasoned that D15 could thus be a good template for the generation of a photoactivatable blocker of endocytosis . Its affinity for amphiphysin SH3 domains is however relatively low ( K D ≈ 100 µM as measure by isothermal titration calorimetry ( Jockusch et al . , 2005 ) ) suggesting that it may have to be used a very high concentrations for such applications . We therefore started this project by identifying more potent peptide - based endocytosis blockers . To this aim , we followed three strategies . • Mutation : Whole interactome scanning experiments revealed that a putative protein fragment consisting of a closely related sequence to D15 was the best polyproline based interactor of amphiphysin 1 and endophilin 1 among the entire human genome ( Landgraf et al . , 2004 ) . In particular , it contains two additional arginines . Since the charges carried by the arginine residues of the D15 sequence have been documented to participate in the interaction between D15 and amphiphysin ( Grabs et al . , 1997 ) , we reasonned that additional charges may favour this interaction even further . We therefore also synthesised this peptide , which we called AL14 ( for 14 - mer amphiphysin ligand ) , as a candidate blocker of endocytosis ( Figure 60 ) . Figure 60 : Sequence alignment of D15 and AL14 • Elongation : The last 44 amino - acids of the PRD of dynamin , which contain the D15 sequence , has been shown to bind very strongly to amphiphysin SH3 domains ( K D ≈ 10 nM as measure by surface plasmon resonance ( Solomaha et al . , 2005 ) ) . We therefore undertook an elongation strategy according to which we produced a library of Methodological Developments 138 truncation peptides based on PRD fragment to determine the contribution of the amino - acids found on the C - terminal or the N - terminal side of the D15 sequence . In particular , we focused our attention on the presence of Class I and Class II consensus interaction motifs between PRDs and SH3 domains . ( Figure 61 ) . Figure 61 : Truncation peptides synthesised for this project The first 44 - amino - acid long peptide , in which the D15 sequence is underlined , consists of the C - terminal fragment of Dyn1 - PRD documented in ( Solomaha et al . , 2005 ) . The D15 sequence is characterised by the presence of two overlapping Class II PRD - SH3 interaction motifs . N - terminal and C - terminal truncations of this fragment have been synthesised displaying either an extra Class I or an extra Class II consensus motif respectively . A tyrosine was added all sequences for absorbance based determination of the concentration . Note : These peptides were all synthesised successfully but have only started to characterise a subset of them so far . Only the ones that we have used either in vitro or in cells will thus be mentioned in the article in preparation presented in the Results section . • Dimerisation : As highlighted in the introduction ( chapter 4 , § B . 1 ) , monovalent ligands may be limited in their ability to interfere with multimeric interaction partners ( Sainlos et al . , 2011 ) . Since both dynamin and amphiphysin form dimers as their basic unit of organisation as well as organise into higher order oligomers around the neck of forming vesicles , it is likely that their interaction strongly depends on avidity . We therefore dimerised the D15 sequence in an attempt to obtain a ligand that would mimic a multivalent interaction partner . To investigate on a potential effect of sequence orientation on further optimising this effect , we synthesised dimeric peptides bound via their N or C terminus . Finally , because the spatial organisation of amphiphysin and the location of its SH3 domains when bound to the membrane is unknown , we produced a library of dimeric peptides displaying various linker lengths ( Figure 62 ) . C HEMICAL B IOLOGY 139 Figure 62 : Sequences of the dimeric peptides synthesised for this project The D15 sequence is dimerised via its C - terminus using the properties of a lysine residue ( K ) or via it N - terminus by click chemistry ( pentagons ) . Monomers are separated by PEG based linkers ( purple dashed lines ) of variable lengths . A tyrosine is added to the D15 sequence for absorbance based determination of the concentration . A . 2 . Synthesis Peptide synthesis and characterisation was performed by Dolors Grillo - Bosh ( postdoctoral fellow ) , Ananda Appavoo ( master student ) and Matthieu Sainlos ( permanent researcher ) in the lab . Precise synthesis protocols will therefore not be detailed here since I was not directly involved in their design . They are however described in the materials and methods section of the paper in preparation presented in the Results section of this manuscript . Briefly , Peptides were synthesised by solid phase methods , purified by RP - HPLC and characterised by analytical RP - HPLC and MALDI - TOF . A tyrosine was added to the all sequences to allow for the determination of final concentrations by UV spectrometry ( UV - 1800 , Shimadzu ) . According to the assay they were to be used in , peptides were functionalised on their N terminus ( or on the linker in the case of dimeric peptides ) . For fluorescence polarisation measurements , they were conjugated either with the green fluorophore fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) or the red fluorophore Sulforhodamine 101 acid chloride ( Texas Red ) . For surface plasmon resonance measurements ( SPR ) , they were biotinylated . For affinity isolation assays they were biotinylated and acetylated . Finally , for in cellulo assays , they were acetylated . Methodological Developments 140 The synthesis of monomeric peptides was performed following standard solid phase synthesis protocols with the exception of D44 which required a particular attention . Indeed , D44 is a long peptide ( 45 amino - acids in total with the tyrosine ) that contains several polyproline regions and is rich in hydrophobic amino - acids such as alanine and valine . These regions also contain arginines which require a bulky side chain protection group . Accordingly , several considerations were to be taken into account when designing its synthetic strategy . Following the expertise of Dolors Grillo - Bosch , we selected a microwave Fmoc / tBu automatic synthesis and a resin with good swelling properties ( Fmoc - NOVA PEG rink amide AM LL resin ( Novabiochem ) ) . We also introduced several double coupling steps in the procedure , as appropriate for the synthesis of difficult peptides ( Grillo - Bosch et al . , 2011 ) . The synthesis of the dimeric peptides was done either manually or automatically according to their orientation . C - terminally linked peptides were synthesised manually due to the need to introduce the PEG motifs at the start of the synthesis procedure . N - terminally linked peptides on the other hand were automatically synthesised before the manual addition of the PEG motifs and subsequent dimerisation by click chemistry . Addition of PEG motifs following the synthesis of the peptide sequence proved rather difficult and necessitated a specific deprotection procedure . All acetylated peptides used in cells were obtained at more than 90 % purity with the exception of N - P3 - [ D15 ] 2 ( 84 . 8 % purity ) . B . Biochemical and biophysical characterisation In addition to the in cellulo experiments that I have performed , a number of peptides were characterised in vitro in collaboration with chemists of our institute . Affinity isolation and fluorescence polarisation experiments were performed by Dolors Grillo - Bosch . Surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed by Matthieu Sainlos . Proteomics analysis was performed by an on - site core facility . Materials and methods used for these experiments are described in the paper in preparation presented in the following section . 141 Results The main results produced during my PhD regarding the development of novel tools to decipher the spatial and temporal regulation of endocytosis in cell lines and in the soma and dendrites of neurons are described in this section . They fall into four parts . The three major ones will be presented in the form of a scientific communication article . Two of these articles mostly have a methodological scope and have to do with advances in imaging possibilities . The third one goes further towards the understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in endocytosis and describes the approaches we are taking to perturb this phenomenon acutely . Finally , I will briefly present in the form of an article abstract , illustrated by a representative figure , some results obtained in a collaborative project for which the tools described in the first article have been needed . The first article presented in this section was published in the Journal of Cell Biology in November 2014 . It deals with the development of a genetically encoded red pH sensor . It shows how we could use this new tool in combination with the widely used pHluorin to demonstrate the differential sorting of two distinct receptors at the level of vesicle formation . The second article , in preparation , describes in detail the methodology we developed to visualise the formation of single endocytic vesicles in living neurons for the first time . We demonstrate that vesicles form at clathrin coated structures in the absence of any detectable changes in the clathrin signal . We use this protocol to study the spatial regulation of endocytosis of neuron specific and non - specific receptors . We found that the activity of endocytic zones in the vicinity of synapses was not regulated under plasticity inducing conditions for either type of receptors . The third article is also in preparation and reports the results obtained so far towards the development of a photoactivatable blocker of endocytosis . It emphasises our efforts to design a specific and high affinity peptide that could interfere with the function of dynamin as well as the setting up of uncaging experiments in combination with our monitoring assay . We highlight the importance of multivalent interactions in driving the endocytic pathway by interfering with scission using mono - and divalent synthetic ligands . Finally , the abstract of the fourth article will introduce the characterisation of a molecular switch regulating the recruitment of OCRL at newly internalised vesicles . 142 P H UJI : A P H S ENSITIVE R ED - F LUORESCENT P ROTEIN F OR I MAGING O F E XO - A ND E NDOCYTOSIS Background : Superecliptic pHluorin ( SEP ) is a green fluorescent pH - sensor that enables the study of membrane trafficking processes such as exo - and endocytosis . It has been used in conjugation with red fluorescent probes to decipher the dynamics of proteins involved in those cellular processes . Having a red - shifted pH - sensor for the detection of exo - and endocytosis would make it possible to use it for dual colour imaging with any of the available and well - characterised green - emitting GFP - based biosensors . None of the so far described pH - sensitive red fluorescent proteins has proved useful for the study of endocytosis . Scientific contribution : We describe pHuji and pHoran4 as being two faithful reporters and exo - and endocytosis . Moreover , pHuji is red - shifted enough to enable two colour imaging with GFP - based biosensors . We used it to demonstrate that the constitutively internalised transferrin receptor ( TfR ) and the ligand - dependent signalling β2 - adrenergic receptor ( β2AR ) are differentially sorted in clathrin coated vesicles ( CCVs ) at the time of vesicle formation . Conclusions & Perspectives : It is now possible to look at the endocytosis of two receptors simultaneously . pHuji should therefore become a useful tool to study in neurons whether TfRs and AMPARs are endocytosed together or whether their internalisation is differentially regulated .

Introduction Genetically encoded sensors based on fluorescent proteins ( FPs ) have become essential tools for studying cell physiology . A broad range of FP - based sensors have now been developed to monitor numerous biochemical parameters including Ca 2 + con - centration ( Zhao et al . , 2011 ) , membrane potential ( Dimitrov et al . , 2007 ) , Cl  concentration ( Jayaraman et al . , 2000 ) , and pH ( Miesenböck et al . , 1998 ) . For studies of exocytosis and en - docytosis , the sensor of choice has been superecliptic pHluorin ( SEP ) , a mutant of enhanced GFP ( Sankaranarayanan et al . , 2000 ) . With a p K a ( i . e . , the pH value at which the fluorescence intensity is 50 % of maximal ) of 7 . 2 , SEP is nearly nonfluor - escent at pH 5 . 5 ( the pH of intracellular secretory vesicles and re - cycling endosomes ) but brightly green fluorescent at pH 7 . 4 ( the extracellular pH ) . The SEP protein , fused to relevant membrane proteins , has been extensively used to detect the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles , secretory vesicles , and recycling endo - somes ( Sankaranarayanan et al . , 2000 ; Gandhi and Stevens , 2003 ; Tsuboi and Rutter , 2003 ; Yudowski et al . , 2006 ; Balaji and Ryan , 2007 ; Jullié et al . , 2014 ) . Moreover , it has been used to detect the formation of clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) using the pulsed pH ( ppH ) protocol ( i . e . , alternating the extracellular pH between 7 . 4 and 5 . 5 ) , which reveals the location of receptors that have been newly internalized with high temporal accuracy ( Merrifield et al . , 2005 ) . A red FP with pH dependence similar to SEP would be of great use because it would enable two - color imaging of mem - brane trafficking events . For example , a red FP pH sensor could be imaged in conjunction with a GFP - tagged protein of interest to analyze the spatial and temporal dynamics of protein recruit - ment during exocytosis ( An et al . , 2010 ) or endocytosis ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . Alternatively , the trafficking of two membrane cargos could be monitored simultaneously to address their dif - ferential sorting . Several pH - sensitive orange to red Discosoma red FP – derived variants have been previously described , with p K a s ranging from 6 . 5 for some proteins of the mFruit series ( i . e . , mOrange , mOrange2 , and mApple ; Shaner et al . , 2004 , 2008 ) to 6 . 9 for mNectarine ( Johnson et al . , 2009 ) and 7 . 8 for pHTomato ( Li and Tsien , 2012 ) . In addition , an excitation ra - tiometric pH sensor with an apparent p K a of 6 . 6 , designated pHRed , was engineered from the long stokes shift FP mKeima ( Tantama et al . , 2011 ) . For practical applications , none of the previously described pH - sensitive red FPs provide in situ pH - dependent changes in fluorescence intensity that are comparable to SEP . To the best of our knowledge , no previous study has directly addressed the question of why these red pH sensors have not proven to be as useful as SEP , despite the substantial effort invested in their F luorescent proteins with pH - sensitive fluorescence are valuable tools for the imaging of exocytosis and endocytosis . The Aequorea green fluorescent protein mutant superecliptic pHluorin ( SEP ) is particularly well suited to these applications . Here we describe pHuji , a red fluorescent protein with a pH sensitivity that ap - proaches that of SEP , making it amenable for detection of single exocytosis and endocytosis events . To demon - strate the utility of the pHuji plus SEP pair , we perform simultaneous two - color imaging of clathrin - mediated in - ternalization of both the transferrin receptor and the  2 adrenergic receptor . These experiments reveal that the two receptors are differentially sorted at the time of en - docytic vesicle formation . pHuji , a pH - sensitive red fluorescent protein for imaging of exo - and endocytosis Yi Shen , 1 * Morgane Rosendale , 2 , 3 * Robert E .

This calculation revealed that the optimal theo - retical p K a value of a pH - sensitive FP is 7 . 5 . Although SEP , with a p K a of 7 . 2 , is the closest to this ideal value , this factor alone is not sufficient to explain the superior performance of SEP relative to the other variants . It quickly be - came apparent that an equally important factor in determining the performance of these pH indicators is the slope of the fluor - escence versus pH curves , which is determined by the apparent Hill coefficient ( n H ) . Indeed , further modeling revealed that a higher n H provides a substantially larger fluorescence change without changing the optimal p K a value ( Fig . 1 B ) . Curve fitting revealed that SEP has an exceptionally high n H of 1 . 90 . Overall , the excellent performance of SEP is caused by the combination of a nearly optimal p K a and a high n H . In contrast , the n H s of mNectarine and pHTomato are 0 . 78 and 0 . 51 , respectively ( Table 1 ) , which largely explains the relatively modest changes in fluorescence for these proteins between pH 5 . 5 and 7 . 5 . Moreover , their emission peaks have more than a 15 - nm blue shift over the pH range of 5 to 10 . In contrast , SEP has a negli - gible peak shift ( Table S1 and Fig . 2 A ) . These limitations prompted us to look for red FP pH sensors with optimized p K a and n H values as well as good optical characteristics such as a red - shifted emission and little pH - dependent peak shift . pHorans : pH - sensitive mOrange variants with fine - tuned pK a s As a first step toward developing a second color of pH sensor with optimized p K a and n H , we created a series of orange FPs with p K a s that approached the ideal value of 7 . 5 . To achieve this goal , we started with mOrange , a bright FP with a p K a of 6 . 5 ( Shaner et al . , 2004 ) . The previously described M163K mutation was introduced to raise the p K a to 7 . 5 ( Shaner et al . , 2008 ) . Using mOrange M163K as a template we performed four rounds of random mutagenesis followed by saturation mutagenesis at resi - dues 163 and 161 , where beneficial mutations had repeatedly showed up during screening of randomly generated libraries . Both of these residues are in close proximity to the chromophore . development . In this work we address this important question and , based on the insights we obtain , engineer a new pH - sensitive red FP . We show here that pHuji , a new red fluorescent pH sen - sor , can be used in conjunction with SEP for two - color imag - ing of exocytic and endocytic events . With the combined use of SEP and pHuji , we demonstrate the differential sorting of two receptors , the transferrin receptor ( TfR ) and the  2 adrenergic receptor (  2AR ) , into individual endocytic vesicles . Results Characterization of SEP and previously described red pH sensors In vitro characterization of the pH dependence of fluorescence demonstrates that SEP is exceptionally well tuned for large fluor - escence changes when transitioning between pH 5 . 5 and 7 . 5 . SEP is almost entirely quenched at pH 5 . 5 and exhibits an  50 - fold higher fluorescence intensity at pH 7 . 5 ( Table 1 ) . In contrast , mNectarine and pHTomato only have approximately sixfold and threefold change , respectively , over the same pH range , despite their relatively high p K a s of 7 . 9 and 6 . 9 , respec - tively ( Table 1 ) . This result demonstrates that p K a alone is not sufficient to characterize a pH - sensitive FP . To find the optimal parameters for maximized fluor - escence change between pH 5 . 5 and 7 . 5 , we modeled the theoretical fluorescence changes between these two pH values assuming various p K a values . These calculations revealed that the fluorescence fold change ( F 7 . 5 / F 5 . 5 ) increases with increasing p K a ( Fig . 1 A , red curve ) . However , a higher pK a also results in lower brightness of the protein in the physiological pH range ( Fig . 1 A , black curves ) . To account for this limitation , we took the relative fluorescence intensity change , ( F 7 . 5  F 5 . 5 ) / F max , into consideration ( Fig . 1 A , blue curve ) . This value is maximal when p K a = 6 . 5 . Multiplication of the functions for fold change and relative change leads to a new function , termed intensity scaled fold change , which represents the optimal compromise of both fluorescence fold change and overall brightness ( Fig . 1 A , Table 1 .

It exhibits relatively bright fluorescence with an EC of 31 , 000 M  1 cm  1 and a quantum yield of 0 . 22 . More importantly , pHuji demonstrates a more than 20 - fold fluorescent intensity change from pH 5 . 5 to 7 . 5 , which , to the best of our knowledge , is the largest reported intensity change for a red FP in this pH range ( Table 1 and Fig . 2 B ) . This is in good accor - dance with the predictions we could make from its high n H and near - optimal p K a value ( Fig . 1 B ) . Finally , pHuji has an emis - sion peak ( 598 nm ) that shows a negligible pH - dependent shift ( Table S1 ) and is well separated from SEP emission ( 512 nm ; Table 1 and Fig . 2 A ) . Simultaneous two - color imaging is there - fore possible with these two variants . Characterization and comparison of pH - sensitive FPs in vitro and in situ Based on the in vitro characterization , we decided to focus on comparing only our best candidates , pHuji and pHoran4 , with previously described SEP and pHTomato in living cells . Ac - cordingly , we transfected HeLa cells with the pH - sensitive red FP in the pDisplay vector to anchor them to the cell surface as a fusion to the transmembrane domain of platelet - derived growth factor receptor . These cells were imaged with total internal re - flection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy in buffered solutions ranging from pH 5 . 0 to 8 . 9 . Similar to the fluorescence mea - surements obtained for recombinant proteins , SEP fluorescence was completely quenched at pH 5 . 0 and maximal at pH 8 . 9 , with a 63 - fold change in fluorescence between pH 5 . 5 and 7 . 5 . The pH sensitivity of red FPs in the same context was qualita - tively similar to the in vitro data , though their pH sensitivity was somewhat less pronounced than expected . pHTomato was poorly pH sensitive , with less than twofold change in fluor - escence between pH 5 . 5 and 7 . 5 . pHuji and pHoran4 were more strongly pH sensitive with fivefold change over the same pH range ( Fig . 2 C ) . However , pHuji and pHoran4 still retained dim fluorescence even at pH 5 . 0 . This could either be caused by environmental factors that result in different pH sensitivities in vitro compared with in cells or by the presence of a visible intracellular pool of protein that is inaccessible to extracellular pH changes . To test for the latter hypothesis , we first applied a solution containing ammonium chloride ( 50 mM ) to cancel intracellular pH gradients ( Miesenböck et al . , 1998 ) . This treat - ment revealed a few intracellular vesicles for all FPs but the overall diffuse fluorescence did not change ( Fig . S2 , A and B ) , demonstrating that this diffuse labeling is indeed caused by pro - teins on the plasma membrane and not in mildly acidic intra - cellular compartments . However , the residual fluorescence at pH 5 . 0 could also be caused by a neutral intracellular compartment . Thus , to collapse all ionic gradients , we permeabilized cells with digitonin ( 50 µg / ml ) . In these conditions , the fluorescence at pH 5 . 0 was still 10 . 0 ± 0 . 8 % ( n = 3 ) and 11 . 0 ± 0 . 8 % ( n = 4 ) of that at pH 7 . 4 for pHoran4 and pHuji , respectively , similar to unpermeabilized cells ( 10 . 1 ± 2 . 9 % [ n = 4 ] and 11 . 1 ± 0 . 7 % [ n = 5 ] ; Fig . S2 , C and D ) . Therefore , the pDisplay vector correctly anchored the FPs at the plasma membrane , but pHoran4 and pHuji are less sensitive to pH in cells than in vitro . Altogether , the strong pH sensitivity of pHuji and pHoran4 led us to further explore their utility as reporters of endocytosis and exocytosis . Colonies that retained high fluorescent brightness were cul - tured and the fluorescent brightness of extracted protein was measured at pH 5 . 5 and 7 . 5 . Two specific mutations , E160K and G196D , which are known to increase the photostability of mOrange ( Shaner et al . , 2008 ) , were also rationally introduced during the course of development . Library screening led to the identification of three bright variants with p K a s of 6 . 7 , 7 . 0 , and 7 . 4 ( Table S2 ) . This series of the pH - sensitive mOrange variants was named pHorans ( pH - sensitive orange FPs ) 1 to 4 accord - ing to their p K a values in ascending order ( Table 1 ) . Despite the fact that pHoran4 is remarkably bright ( extinction coefficient [ EC ] of 83 , 000 M  1 cm  1 and quantum yield 0 . 66 ) and has a p K a value close to SEP , its fluorescence intensity fold change from pH 5 . 5 to 7 . 5 is still significantly smaller than that of SEP ( Table 1 and Fig . 2 B ) because of its lower n H value of 0 . 92 . Unfortunately , pHoran variants with higher n H values were not identified during exhaustive library screening . Yet another drawback of the pHorans is that their orange fluorescent emis - sion spectra ( with emission peaks close to 560 nm ) result in substantial spectral bleed - through when combined with SEP for two - color imaging . We also explored the strategy of modifying the chromo - phore structure of the red FP mCherry ( Shaner et al . , 2004 ) . We found that a variant with the threonine – tyrosine – glycine ( TYG ) chromophore ( as in mOrange ) , designated as mCherry - TYG , has a significantly higher p K a of 7 . 8 and an apparent n H of 0 . 73 ( Table 1 ) . Because of its pH - dependent emission peak shift ( Table S1 ) and an incomplete quenching at low pH ( Fig . S1 A ) , this variant was not further pursued . pHuji : a red pH - sensitive FP with near - optimal pK a and a high apparent n H For our next attempt at developing an improved red pH sen - sor with an emission peak well separated from that of SEP , we turned to mApple as a template ( Shaner et al . , 2008 ) . Libraries were constructed by randomizing residues in close proximity to the chromophore , including positions 64 , 70 , 95 , 97 , 146 , 148 , 159 , 161 , 163 , 177 , and 197 ( numbered according to mCherry crystal structure , PDB ID 2H5Q ; Shaner et al . , 2004 ) . After initial screening , it was found that positions 161 and 163 were primarily responsible for modulating the p K a of mApple . Ac - cordingly , we constructed a targeted library of variants by satu - ration mutagenesis of both positions 161 and 163 and screened exhaustively for variants with increased p K a and higher n H s . Several pH - sensitive variants , including A - 9 , A - 17 , and A - 47 , were identified from the library ( Tables 1 and S2 ) . Among them , one variant with a single mutation of K163Y demonstrated the highest pH sensitivity with a p K a of 7 . 7 and an apparent n H of 1 . 10 . Notably , all of the mApple variants as well as pHoran3 and pHoran4 have essential mutations at position 163 , predicted from published mFruit structures ( Shu et al . , 2006 ) to be close to the chromophore ( Fig . S1 , B and C ) , clearly demonstrating that this residue plays a key role in modulating the pH sensitiv - ity of variants of the Discosoma red FP . Two rounds of random mutagenesis using mApple K163Y as the template did not result in further improvements in pH sensitivity . Accordingly , mApple K163Y was designated as pHuji ( pronounced Fuji , a common on N o v e m be r 12 , 2014 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published November 10 , 2014 423 pHuji , a pH - sensitive red fluorescent protein • Shen et al . with TfR - pHoran4 and TfR - pHuji were only slightly lower than that obtained with TfR - SEP . In contrast , events detected in TfR - pHTomato – transfected cells were very rare ( Fig . 4 D ) . In 3T3 cells , scission events fall into two categories : terminal events , where the cluster visible at pH 7 . 4 disappears < 40 s after scis - sion , and nonterminal events , where it remains visible ( Merrifield et al . , 2005 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . The proportion of terminal events measured in this dataset (  40 % ) was very similar for SEP - , pHoran4 - , and pHuji - tagged TfR ( Fig . 4 E ) and to pub - lished data ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . Although there was some resid - ual fluorescence at pH 5 . 0 before scission for the pHoran4 and pHuji constructs , the mean fluorescence time course of events detected with TfR - SEP , TfR - pHoran4 , and TfR - pHuji were quite similar after scission ( Fig . 4 , F and G ; and Fig . S3 A ) . Vesicles Detection of single exocytic and endocytic events with TfR - red FPs The TfR fused to SEP ( TfR - SEP ) has been widely used to de - tect single endocytosis ( Merrifield et al . , 2005 ) and exocytosis events ( Xu et al . , 2011 ; Jullié et al . , 2014 ) . Indeed , in cells trans - fected with TfR - SEP , exocytic events are readily detected in continuous TIRF recordings as sudden bursts of fluorescence as receptors go from an acidic intravesicular to the neutral extra - cellular compartment , and then rapidly diffuse from the site of exocytosis ( Fig . 3 A ) . However , we noticed that pHuji , like ear - lier versions of its mApple template ( Shaner et al . , 2008 ) , has a pronounced photoswitching behavior , with fluorescence going down to  35 % of initial fluorescence in < 2 s of continuous illumination in our recording conditions ( Fig . 3 B ) . Nevertheless , this behavior did not impair the ability to obtain stable time - lapse recording conditions to study endocytosis ( Fig . 3 C and see Fig . 7 D ) , and we could record exocytic events with similar profiles as those recorded with TfR - SEP ( Fig . 3 D ) . Conversely , pHoran4 or pHTomato did not have a measureable photoswitch - ing behavior and could also be used to detect exocytosis as shown previously ( Li and Tsien , 2012 ; Jullié et al . , 2014 ) . The ppH protocol ( Merrifield et al . , 2005 ) was developed to detect the formation of endocytic vesicles loaded with TfR - SEP . This protocol involves alternating the extracellular pH be - tween 7 . 4 and 5 . 5 every 2 s . At pH 5 . 5 , receptors fused to SEP on the plasma membrane are not fluorescent , and all observed fluorescence is attributable to receptors sequestered inside en - docytic vesicles . Accordingly , the formation of a new endocytic vesicle is revealed when a cluster of receptors concentrated at a clathrin - coated pit ( CCP ) that is visible during a pH 7 . 4 interval remains visible during the following pH 5 . 5 interval . Impor - tantly , optimal detection of these vesicles is achieved when the preexisting cluster is minimally fluorescent at pH 5 . 5 , as is the case with SEP . Cells transfected with TfR - red FPs had a punctu - ate distribution over homogenous fluorescence similar to cells transfected with TfR - SEP ( Fig . 4 A and Videos 1 – 4 ) . The TfR clusters indeed correspond to CCPs ( see Fig . 5 , A – C ) . Some moving intracellular vesicles were seen in cells transfected with TfR - pHTomato ( Video 1 ) , reflecting the incomplete quenching of this FP in vesicles that are known to be acidic and usually not seen with SEP , pHoran4 , or pHuji . To visualize the formation of single CCVs using red FPs , we slightly modified the ppH protocol : we changed to low pH solution at pH 5 . 0 instead of 5 . 5 to maximize the quenching of plasma membrane receptors . TfR - SEP clusters were completely quenched during low pH intervals . TfR - pHoran4 and TfR - pHuji clusters were largely , although not completely , quenched , but TfR - pHTomato clusters were only partially quenched ( Fig . 4 B ) . During the ppH protocol , scission events were clearly seen with all the constructs tested ( Fig . 4 C ) . Similar to the original ppH protocol ( Merrifield et al . , 2005 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) , low pH solution did not have any apparent adverse effect on cells , as the frequency of detected events was constant for at least 20 min of recording ( see Fig . 7 D ) . We detected and quantified en - docytic events using the algorithm developed previously ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) with minor modifications ( see Materials and methods for a complete description ) .

Conversely , having a red reporter for endocytosis now makes it possible and convenient to use any of the many readily available and well - characterized GFP - tagged proteins in this same context . Because pHuji fluorescence emis - sion occurs at a longer wavelength than that of pHoran4 ( Table 1 ) , spectral bleed - through from the green channel is minimized . It should thus be preferred for simultaneous two - color imaging with a green fluorescent probe . As a proof of concept , we have looked at the recruitment profiles of clathrin light chain A ( clc - GFP ) and dynamin 1 ( dyn1 - GFP ) while assessing CCV formation with TfR - pHuji and the ppH protocol . As expected , clc - GFP is very were also visible a little longer , presumably as they acidified ( Fig . 4 G ) . This is consistent with the incomplete quenching of pHoran4 or pHuji fluorescence at acidic pH . We conclude from these results that pHuji and pHoran4 are both useful reporters of TfR trafficking and endocytic vesicles detection . Dual color imaging of endocytosis with TfR - pHuji An interesting application of a red pH - sensitive FP is to observe the recruitment profile of proteins involved in endocytosis . The ppH protocol has been extensively used for this purpose ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . However , the need to use the green channel for the Figure 4 .

Moreover , clc - GFP was present at all times of CCV formation ( Fig . 5 , D and E ) , whereas dyn1 - GFP is transiently recruited to sites of CCV formation reaching maximal intensity 4 s before vesicle detection at pH 5 . 0 ( i . e . , 2 s before vesicle scission ; Fig . 5 , D and E ) . The mean traces obtained with TfR - pHuji and clc - GFP or dyn1 - GFP closely re - semble the ones obtained with TfR - SEP and the corresponding mCherry fusion proteins ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . Simultaneous detection of CCV formation with TfR - SEP and TfR - pHuji To test whether TfR - pHuji detects the formation of the same CCVs as TfR - SEP , we cotransfected 3T3 cells with both constructs well colocalized with TfR - pHuji ( Fig . 5 A ) . Quantitative analysis shows that the fluorescence of clusters in both channels is well correlated ( R = 0 . 71 ± 0 . 06 , n = 5 ) . The vast majority of clusters , identified by automated wavelet - based segmentation , were de - tected in both channels ( Fig . 5 B , yellow dots , representing 79 . 4 ± 2 . 9 % of all segmented clusters ; and Fig . 5 C , a ) , consistent with previous results using TfR - SEP and clc - DsRed ( Merrifield et al . , 2005 ) or clc - mCherry ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . Nevertheless , some clusters were detected in only one channel ( Fig . 5 B , green and red dots ) despite high fluorescence values in both channels . We thus set up objective thresholds for cluster enrichment by taking the fluorescence intensity of the dimmest detected cluster in the GFP or pHuji channel ( Fig . 5 B , green and red lines , respectively ) as our detection limit .

Before stimulation , SEP -  2AR was mostly homo - geneously distributed throughout the membrane ( Fig . 7 A ) , al - though some dim concentrations of receptors could already be seen . Stimulation with isoproterenol ( 20 µM ) , a selective  AR agonist , quickly induced a dramatic relocalization of diffuse re - ceptors into those clusters , leading to an overall 1 . 5 ± 0 . 2 - fold increase of the mean cluster intensity ( Fig . 7 B ) . Correlation analysis of cluster fluorescence showed that  80 % of the clus - ters contained both receptors ( Fig . 7 C ) , demonstrating that  2AR relocalizes to the vast majority of CCPs . This relocaliza - tion also translated in a significant increase in the correlation between the fluorescence intensities of both receptors before and after stimulation ( R = 0 . 48 ± 0 . 08 and 0 . 82 ± 0 . 02 , respec - tively ; n = 5 ; P < 0 . 01 ; Fig . 7 B ) . The ppH protocol then re - vealed that the frequency of SEP -  2AR – containing vesicles increased 2 . 3 - fold upon stimulation , whereas the frequency of TfR - pHuji – containing vesicles remained constant ( Fig . 7 D ) . and Fig . S4 for details ) , we found that 33 . 2 ± 6 . 4 % of events were detected in both channels , for a total of 5 , 126 events in five cells ( Fig . 6 F , a ) . As for clusters visible at pH 7 . 4 , CCV fluor - escence measured with the two markers was positively corre - lated ( R = 0 . 64 ± 0 . 03 , n = 5 ; Fig . 5 E ) . Moreover , using objective thresholds determined as before , 89 . 3 ± 1 . 7 or 94 . 3 ± 1 . 7 % of CCVs detected with SEP or pHuji , respectively , contained both markers ( Fig . 6 F , b ) . Accordingly , the mean fluorescence of events detected either in the SEP ( Fig . 6 G ) or the pHuji ( Fig . 6 H ) channel was remarkably similar in both channels . We conclude from this data that the two FPs allow the detection of the same population of forming CCVs . Differential sorting of TfR and  2AR into CCVs Having demonstrated that SEP and pHuji could equally be used to detect the loading of individual CCVs with TfR , we next in - vestigated their utility for detecting two distinct receptors into nascent CCVs .

Interestingly , the two most pH - sensitive red FPs identi - fied in this work , pHuji and pHoran4 , both have mutations at residue 163 ( K163Y and M163K , respectively ) . This result in - dicates the importance of this position in regulating p K a and n H of red FPs . In the absence of an x - ray crystal structure , we can - not know for certain how these mutations are modulating the chromophore environment . However , the close proximity of the side chain of residue 163 to the chromophore phenolate group leads us to speculate that these mutations are serving to raise the p K a by either stabilizing the anionic form or destabilizing the protonated neutral form . Both tyrosine and lysine side chains normally have p K a s in the range of 10 to 11 , so deprotonation of the side chain of residue 163 in either pHuji or pHoran is un - likely to be acting cooperatively in the pH 5 . 0 to 7 . 5 range . In - deed , the observed increases in n H for both of these variants are relatively modest . However , they provide large improvements in their performance for imaging membrane trafficking events . The properties of pHuji , with a p K a of 7 . 7 and an n H of 1 . 1 , make it six - to sevenfold more pH sensitive than the previously described red pH sensor pHTomato ( Li and Tsien , 2012 ) in the physiological range . However , pHuji should not be considered a replacement for SEP because it still falls short of SEP in terms of the magnitude of fluorescence fold change between pH 5 . 0 and 7 . 5 , especially in situ . In addition , pHuji , like earlier ver - sions of its mApple template ( Shaner et al . , 2008 ) and mApple - derived R - GECO1 ( Wu et al . , 2013 ) , exhibits photoswitching behavior . This did not impair our detection sensitivity based on steady - state time - lapse ( for endocytosis ) or continuous ( for exocytosis ) recordings . Nevertheless , pHuji should be used with caution for quantitative imaging of exocytosis such as in synap - tic terminals ( Schweizer and Ryan , 2006 ) or protocols based on photobleaching ( e . g . , FRAP ; González - González et al . , 2012 ) . Notably , pHoran4 does not display this behavior and should provide a good alternative to pHuji when needed . Clearly , the most appropriate application of pHuji is as the preferred second color for simultaneous dual color imaging of pH - sensitive pro - cesses with GFP - or SEP - based probes . Importantly , the emis - sion peak of pHuji is well separated from that of GFP and there is almost no spectral shift associated with the transition from the low to high pH state . We demonstrate this possibility by im - aging single endocytic events detected with TfR - pHuji together with GFP - tagged dyn1 and clc . The protein recruitment profiles revealed are similar to the converse experiment using mCherry - tagged proteins and TfR - SEP ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . Therefore , two - color experiments with pHuji would be compatible with any of the high number of existing GFP fusion proteins and GFP - based sensors , such as ion sensors ( Jayaraman et al . , 2000 ; Dimitrov et al . , 2007 ; Zhao et al . , 2011 ) , Förster resonance en - ergy transfer – based sensors ( Ganesan et al . , 2006 ) , or experi - ments using blue - light photoactivatable molecules and proteins ( Kramer et al . , 2009 ; Tucker , 2012 ) . Finally , with two pH - sensitive tags at our disposal and the ppH assay , we can now address the differential sorting of two distinct receptors into individual endocytic vesicles . The ques - tion of early cargo sorting had already been addressed by previ - ous studies at the level of the clustering at the plasma membrane A more detailed analysis of the data showed that some CCVs contained both receptors , whereas others contained no SEP -  2AR ( Fig . 8 , A and B ) . To determine the relative con - tent of each receptor in single vesicles , we performed the same analysis as described above ( Fig . 8 , C and D ) . Contrary to the high correlation of clusters at pH 7 . 4 ( Fig . 7 B ) there was very little correlation between the intensities of both markers in a given CCV at pH 5 . 0 during stimulation ( R = 0 . 32 ± 0 . 05 , n = 7 ) . This was significantly less correlated than the fluorescence intensity of CCVs colabeled with TfR - SEP and TfR - pHuji ( Fig . 6 E , P < 0 . 05 ) . Likewise , a minority of CCVs containing TfR - pHuji contained detectable SEP -  2AR ( 31 . 0 ± 7 . 4 % , n = 7 ) , in sharp contrast with the observation that 72 . 7 ± 5 . 9 % of CCVs detected with SEP -  2AR also contained TfR - pHuji ( Fig . 8 D ) . The segregation of SEP -  2AR in a subpopulation of TfR - pHuji vesicles is further reflected in the mean fluorescence traces : the amount of SEP -  2AR visible at pH 5 . 0 in CCVs detected with pHuji is less than half that of CCVs detected with SEP ( 38 . 8 % ; Fig . 8 , E and F ) . In contrast , the mean fluorescence of TfR - pHuji at pH 5 . 0 varies less according to the channel of detection : the pHuji fluorescence in SEP - detected CCVs is 64 . 2 % of that in pHuji - detected CCVs ( Fig . 8 , E and F ) . Finally , the results were reproducible when tags were exchanged in a converse experi - ment using pHuji -  2AR and TfR - SEP ( Fig . S5 ) , showing that the differential sorting of receptors to CCVs was not an artifact caused by the FPs . In conclusion , our data are consistent with a model in which  2ARs relocalize almost equally to all CCPs on the membrane , but are then differentially sorted inside nascent CCVs ( Fig . 8 G ) . Discussion This work was motivated by our realization that the subopti - mal performance of red fluorescent pH indicators largely stems from the fact that previous efforts had been mostly focused on optimizing p K a and had not given appropriate attention to maxi - mizing n H . Indeed , our modeling of the response of pH indica - tors suggests that the value of the n H is actually more important than the value of the p K a to describe pH sensitivity . The major - ity of previous studies on FP - based pH sensors have assumed an apparent n H of 1 . 0 when fitting the pH titration curve , with two notable exceptions ( Kneen et al . , 1998 ; Sniegowski et al . , 2005 ) . Two intensity - based pH - sensitive red FPs , mNectarine ( Johnson et al . , 2009 ) and pHTomato ( Li and Tsien , 2012 ) , have suitably elevated p K a s but relatively low n H s . SEP , the best available FP - based pH indicator , has a p K a that is close to op - timal but is really set apart from other pH - sensitive FPs by its exceptionally high n H of 1 . 90 . This high value is indicative of the existence of a second residue that can be deprotonated and interacts with the chromophore in a cooperative manner . Based on the observation that n H can greatly differ from protein to pro - tein as a result of altered chromophore environment , we set out to engineer variants with larger fluorescence intensity changes to a given pH change . To engineer a pH - sensitive red FP with a high n H , we used several strategies including direct mutation of the chromophore , modulation of the chromophore environment by site - directed on N o v e m be r 12 , 2014 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published November 10 , 2014 429 pHuji , a pH - sensitive red fluorescent protein • Shen et al .

Screening for pH sen - sitivity of extracted protein was performed with a Safire2 fluorescence plate reader ( Tecan ) by measuring protein fluorescence intensity in buffers ranging from pH 4 . 0 to 9 . 0 by steps of 1 . 0 . p K a s and apparent n H s were estimated according to the screening results . Plasmids corresponding to the variants with relatively higher p K a s and larger apparent n H s were purified with the GeneJET miniprep kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and then sequenced using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing kit ( Applied Biosystems ) . Protein purification and in vitro characterization To purify the pH - sensitive FPs , electrocompetent E . coli strain DH10B was transformed with the plasmid of interest using Micropulser electroporator ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) . Transformed bacteria were cultured overnight on agar plates containing LB and ampicillin . Single colonies were picked and grown overnight in 4 ml of LB supplemented with ampicillin at 37°C . For each colony , the 4 - ml culture was then used to inoculate 250 ml of LB me - dium with ampicillin and grown to an optical density of 0 . 6 . Protein ex - pression was induced with addition of 0 . 02 % arabinose and the culture was grown overnight at 37°C . Bacteria were harvested at 10 , 000 rpm , 4°C for 10 min , lysed using a cell disruptor ( Constant Systems ) , and then clarified at 14 , 000 rpm for 30 min . The protein was purified from the su - pernatant by Ni - NTA affinity chromatography ( ABT ) according to the man - ufacturer’s instructions . The buffer of the purified protein was exchanged with 10 mM Tris - Cl and 150 mM NaCl , pH 7 . 3 , with Amicon ultra centrifu - gal filter ( molecular weight cut - off of 10 , 000 ) , for a final protein concentra - tion of  10 µM . Molar ECs were measured by the alkali denaturation method ( Gross et al . , 2000 ) . In brief , the protein was diluted into Tris buffer or 1 M NaOH and the absorbance spectra was recorded under both con - ditions . The EC was calculated assuming the denatured red FP chromo - phore has an EC of 44 , 000 M  1 cm  1 at 452 nm . Fluorescence quantum yields were determined using mOrange ( for pHOran4 ) or mApple ( for pHuji ) as standards . Fluorescence intensity as a function of pH was determined by dis - pensing 2 µl of the protein solution into 50 µl of the desired pH buffer in triplicate into a 396 - well clear - bottomed plate ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and measured in a Safire2 plate reader . pH buffer solutions from pH 3 to 11 were prepared according to the Carmody buffer system ( Carmody , 1961 ) . p K a and apparent n H were determined by fitting the normalized data to the following equation : F n pK pH H a = + − 1 1 10 ( ) . Cell culture and transfections NIH - 3T3 ( European Collection of Cell Cultures ) and HeLa ( gift from A . Echard , Pasteur Institute , Paris , France ) cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum , 1 % sodium pyruvate , and 1 % Glutamax with ( HeLa ) or without ( NIH - 3T3 ) 1 % penicillin / streptomycin and maintained at 37°C in 5 % CO 2 . Cells were subcultured every 2 – 4 d for maintenance . 24 h before imaging , cells were transfected with 1 – 3 µg of total DNA , complexed with either 10 µl Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ; NIH - 3T3 ) or 3 – 6 µl X - TREMEGene - HP ( Roche ; HeLa ) in serum - free medium . 4 h later , cells were plated on 18 - mm glass coverslips ( coated with 0 . 1 mM polylysine for 3 min and then rinsed with 1× PBS for NIH - 3T3 ) at a density of  70 , 000 cells / ml in supplemented DMEM . TfR - SEP and dyn1 - GFP plasmids were provided by C . Merrifield ( Laboratoire d’Enzymologie et Biochimie Structurales , Gif - sur - Yvette , France ) and clc - GFP was a gift of A . Echard ( Pasteur Institute , Paris , France ) . pDis - play constructs of SEP , pHTomato , pHoran4 , and pHuji were made by subcloning the genes of the pH - sensitive proteins into the pDisplay vector ( Life Technologies ) between the BglII and SalI restriction sites . The pDisplay vector is translated into a protein consisting of the N - terminal signal pep - tide and a C - terminal transmembrane domain of platelet - derived growth factor receptor , which enables anchoring of the fused protein to the cell surface . TfR - pHoran4 , TfR - pHTomato , and TfR - pHuji were produced by PCR amplification of the relevant red FPs and inserted into the TfR - SEP vector using Nhe1 and Age1 sites . Live cell fluorescence imaging Live cell imaging was done at 37°C . Cells were perfused with Hepes buff - ered saline ( HBS ) solution with 135 mM NaCl , 5 mM KCl , 0 . 4 mM MgCl 2 , 1 . 8 mM CaCl 2 , 20 mM Hepes , and 1 mM d - glucose , adjusted to pH 7 . 4 and 300 – 315 mOsmol / l and supplemented with 2 % fetal calf serum for HeLa cells . For pH titration with pDisplay constructs , solutions were prepared ( Puthenveedu and von Zastrow , 2006 ) or at the level of early endosomes ( Lakadamyali et al . , 2006 ) . Here , we identify a new step at which receptor sorting can occur . By directly measur - ing the content of TfRs and  2ARs within a single vesicle at the time of its formation , we determined that selective cargo recruitment can occur at the time of internalization even though both receptors cluster equally well to CCPs after stimulation of the  2ARs . This result is unlikely to be an artifact of the imag - ing method because such segregation of receptors during vesi - cle formation did not occur when TfRs were labeled with SEP and pHuji . In contrast , we did observe the same behavior when the fluorescent tags were exchanged to label TfRs and  2ARs . This result is best explained if we consider that certain clath - rin structures at the plasma membrane , sometimes referred to as plaques ( Saffarian et al . , 2009 ) , can generate multiple CCVs , visible by light microscopy as so - called nonterminal events ( Merrifield et al . , 2005 ; Perrais and Merrifield , 2005 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ; this study ) , without collapsing . Such occurrences may correspond to clathrin - coated structures , best seen with freeze - etch electron microscopy ( Fujimoto et al . , 2000 ; Traub , 2009 ) , consisting of large flat clathrin lattices concomitant with invaginations corresponding to nascent CCVs on their sides . In our model ( Fig . 7 G ) , some receptors , such as TfR , and associ - ated adaptor proteins would be equally well sorted to the two compartments , whereas others would be sorted preferentially to the flat parts , such as  2AR after agonist binding . Interestingly , many proteins associated with the plasma membrane show curvature - dependent binding ( McMahon and Gallop , 2005 ) . The curvature - sensing ability of  - arrestin , the likely adaptor protein for  2AR ( Goodman et al . , 1996 ; Traub , 2009 ) , is cur - rently unknown . However , other adaptor proteins such as epsin , an adaptor for ubiquitinated receptors , show strong preference for curved membranes ( Capraro et al . , 2010 ) and could affect the sorting of such receptors to the more deeply invaginated parts . A potential role for such differential targeting could be to ensure prolonged signaling from plasma membrane – localized platforms . Therefore , selective sorting within endocytic struc - tures could be a general mechanism for the regulation of recep - tor signaling and trafficking . In conclusion , we expect that pHuji will prove widely use - ful as the preferred second color of pH - sensitive probe for simul - taneous imaging of multiple receptors and associated proteins during vesicle formation and release at the plasma membrane . Materials and methods Mutagenesis , library construction , and screening of pH - sensitive FPs Directed evolution of pHorans and pHuji was performed by site - directed mutagenesis and multiple rounds of error - prone PCR using plasmids encod - ing mOrange and mApple as templates . All site - directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange lightning mutagenesis kit ( Agilent Tech - nologies ) and primers designed according to the manufacturer’s guidelines . Error - prone PCR products were digested with XhoI and HindIII , ligated into pBAD / His B vector digested with the same two enzymes , and used to trans - form electrocompetent Escherichia coli strain DH10B ( Invitrogen ) , which were then plated on agar plates containing LB medium supplemented with 0 . 4 mg / ml ampicillin and 0 . 02 % wt / vol l - arabinose . Single colonies were picked , inoculated into 4 ml of LB medium with 0 . 1 mg / ml ampicillin and 0 . 02 % wt / vol l - arabinose , and then cultured over - night . Protein was extracted using B - PER bacterial extraction reagent ( Thermo on N o v e m be r 12 , 2014 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published November 10 , 2014 431 pHuji , a pH - sensitive red fluorescent protein • Shen et al . because of the presence of background noise in pH 5 . 0 images , often coming from partial quenching of surface clusters ( Fig . S4 C , pH 7 . 4 vs . pH 5 . 0 images ) . Therefore , we tried to improve the method to detect can - didate endocytic events . To highlight sudden changes in fluorescence at pH 5 . 0 images , we computed a differential movie , i . e . , each image minus an average of the five previous images plus a constant . Such highlighted objects were then detected using MIA as candidate events and tested for criteria ( a – c ) as described in the previous paragraph . Segmentation and tracking of these candidate events were performed by generating a back - ground - subtracted movie consisting of images minus an average of five im - ages before vesicle appearance ( Fig . S4 C ) . After this step , the candidate event was kept if it could be tracked for more than three frames ( criterion d ) . This second detection method was more sensitive than the first one ( Fig . S4 D ) but generated more false positives ( 30 % for TfR - SEP , 50 % for TfR - pHuji , 58 % for  2AR - SEP , and up to 90 % for  2AR - pHuji ) , which made the analysis a lot more time consuming . Therefore , we used it solely to ana - lyze the coenrichment of receptors in CCVs . Once events were validated , event frequency was measured for each cell and normalized to the area of the cell visible on the TIRF image . Quantification of fluorescence intensities Fluorescence intensities plotted in Figs . 2 C and S2 ( pDisplay experiments ) are calculated as the mean intensity in a region of interest within the cell minus a mean background fluorescence taken from a region of interest out - side the cell . Exocytosis events ( Fig . 3 ) were detected by eye and the fluorescence minus a background ( i . e . , average of five images before the event ) was quantified in a 3 - pixel ( 450 - nm ) - radius circle . Fluorescence intensities in relation with scission events are calculated similar to Taylor et al . ( 2011 ) . In brief , each value represents the mean in - tensity in a 2 - pixel ( 300 - nm ) - radius circle to which the local background intensity is subtracted . This local background is estimated in an annulus ( 5 pixels outer radius and 2 pixels inner radius ) centered on the region to be quantified , as the mean intensity of pixel values between the 20th and 80th percentiles ( to exclude neighboring fluorescent objects ) . Quantifica - tion of fluorescence intensities in the other channel than the one used for detection was done using a set of x / y coordinates corrected for distortions caused by the Dual View system . This correction was calculated as a third order polynomial transformation using images of 0 . 2 - µm TetraSpeck beads ( Invitrogen ) taken before each experiment . Bleed - through from one channel to the other was not corrected . Protein enrichment in clusters or vesicles was assessed by computing randomized datasets as in Taylor et al . ( 2011 ) , reflecting the overall background fluorescence of the cell over which fluor - escence enrichment becomes significant . Events could be classified as ter - minal or nonterminal depending on whether the fluorescence in pH 7 . 4 images 36 s after detection were < 40 % ( terminal ) or > 60 % ( nonterminal ) of the fluorescence in images at pH 7 . 4 just before detection . We define objects ( either pH 7 . 4 clusters or pH 5 . 0 scission events ) as co - detected when they are independently detected in each channel < 2 frames and 5 pixels ( 750 nm ) apart . To determine the Euclidian distance between an object and its nearest neighbor in the other channel at a given frame , the x / y coordinates of one of the two datasets were corrected using the polynomial transformation described in the previous paragraph . Fluor - escence intensity of each dot on the scatter plots of Figs . 5 – 8 and S5 is calculated as the intensity of an object ( determined as described in the pre - vious paragraph ) at its time of detection . The lower detection limits of SEP and pHuji markers were estimated as the intensity of the least fluorescent detected object ( Figs . 5 – 8 and S5 , green and red lines ) . Any object falling below the red or green line is considered as containing only SEP or pHuji , respectively , and objects above both these lines as enriched in the other marker ( i . e . , containing both markers ) . Correlation between fluorescence intensities in the red and green channels is given as the Pearson’s linear correlation coefficient R . Online supplemental material Fig . S1 shows the in vitro pH sensitivity of proteins tested in this study and models of mutated residues in pHoran4 and pHuji relative to the chromo - phore . Fig .

S5 shows the detection of CCVs and differential sorting of TfR - SEP and pHuji -  2AR in the same cell . Table S1 shows the emission peak of FPs at different pH values . Table S2 gives the mutations of the pH - sensitive red FPs developed in this study . Videos 1 – 4 show record - ings of the cells transfected with TfR - SEP , TfR - pHtomato , TfR - pHoran4 , and as the HBS solution described using as pH buffers Hepes for solutions at pH 8 . 9 , 8 . 0 , 7 . 52 , and 6 . 96 , Pipes for solutions at pH 6 . 5 and 6 . 0 , and MES for solutions at pH 5 . 5 and 5 . 09 . For the ppH protocol , a theta pipette (  100 - µm tip size achieved using a vertical Narishige puller ; World Precision Instruments ) was placed close to the recorded cell . One way contained HBS ( pH 7 . 4 ; see previous paragraph for recipe ) and the other contained a solution where Hepes was replaced with MES ( MES buffered saline solution ) and buffered at pH 5 . 0 . Solution flow was alternated every 2 s using electrovalves ( Lee Company ) switching in synchrony with image acquisition . For experiments on  2AR internalization , isoproterenol ( Tocris Bioscience ) dissolved the day of the experiment was applied by exchanging both solutions in the application pipette with HBS solution and MES buffered saline solution containing 20 µM isoproterenol . TIRF imaging was performed on an inverted microscope ( IX71 ; Olympus ) equipped with an Apochromat N oil 60× objective ( NA 1 . 49 ) , a 1 . 6× magnifying lens , and an electron multiplying charge coupled device camera ( QuantEM : 512SC ; Roper Scientific ) . Samples were illuminated by a 473 - nm laser ( Cobolt ) for SEP imaging , as well as by a coaligned 561 - nm laser for red FP imaging . Emitted fluorescence was filtered using filters ( Chroma Technology Corp . ) : 595 / 50 m for pHoran4 imaging , 620 / 60 m for pHuji and pHTomato imaging , and 525 / 50 m for SEP / GFP imag - ing . Simultaneous dual color imaging was achieved using a DualView beam splitter ( Roper Scientific ) . To correct for x / y distortions between the two channels , images of fluorescently labeled beads ( Tetraspeck , 0 . 2 µm ; Invitrogen ) were taken before each experiment and used to align the two channels ( see Quantification of fluorescence intensities ) . The camera was controlled by MetaVue7 . 1 ( Roper Scientific ) . Semi - automated detection of endocytic events The detection , tracking , quantification , and validation of endocytic events was performed using scripts in two ways . First , to analyze cells transfected with single label TfR ( i . e . , single transfections and cotransfections with clc - GFP or dyn1 - GFP ) , we used the algorithm developed previously in Matlab 7 . 4 ( Mathworks ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) with minor modifications . This method of detection had been characterized as missing  30 % of all events but has a low percentage of false positives (  20 % ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) , making it possible to work with large datasets . For these experiments , a quantitative detection of all endocytic events was not essential and we favored a fast and efficient data analysis . As shown in Fig . S10 of Taylor et al . ( 2011 ) , the endocytic events not automatically detected are essentially similar to the de - tected ones . In brief , movies of cells acquired during the ppH protocol were divided in two or four parts : images of TfR - SEP ( or , alternatively , TfR - red FP ) at pH 5 . 0 and at pH 7 . 4 , and , when applicable , images of the other color at pH 5 . 0 and at pH 7 . 4 . Objects ( i . e . , TfR extracellular clusters , corre - sponding to CCPs in images at pH 7 . 4 and putative intracellular CCVs in images at pH 5 . 0 ) were detected and tracked using multidimensional image analysis ( MIA ; developed for Metamorph [ Ropert Scientific ] by J . B . Sibarita , Interdisciplinary Institute for Neuroscience , Bordeaux , France ) . Objects detected at pH 5 . 0 were considered bona fide endocytic events if ( a ) their intensity could be quantified correctly ( regions of interet around the center of the object entirely defined within the images ) , ( b ) they overlapped with a cluster detected in images at pH 7 . 4 ( minimum 20 % overlap for TfR endocytosis and 10 % for  2AR endocytosis ) , ( c ) their signal / noise ratio was greater than a given threshold ( five for TfR endocytosis and three for  2AR endocytosis ) , ( d ) they could be tracked for more than three frames ( i . e . , more than 8 s ) , and ( e ) they either appeared de novo or saw their in - tensity increase at least threefold during the course of their tracking ( crite - rion added as compared with Taylor et al . [ 2011 ] to compensate for partial quenching of extracellular clusters ) . The candidate events that passed these criteria were then visually inspected and validated as endocytic events by the user . There were 78 ± 3 % of events validated by the user with TfR - SEP , a proportion very similar to previous work ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . In contrast , 57 ± 4 , 55 ± 4 , and 24 ± 3 % of candidate events detected in TfR - pHuji , TfR - pHoran4 , and TfR - pHTomato were validated by the user , respectively . The increased number of false positives is most likely caused by increased noise as a result of incomplete quenching of the red FPs at pH 5 . 0 . Second , to detect endocytic events with two receptors , we found that only a small fraction of TfR - SEP and TfR - pHuji events was detected in both channels (  20 % ; Fig . S4 E ) using the method described in the previous paragraph . We noticed that only few events were indeed visible with one label only ( Fig . S4 , A and B ) . Most of them , however , should be consid - ered as true endocytic events in both channels but were only detected as such by the original detection method in one ( Fig . S4 C ) . The main reason for the occurrence of these false negatives was that the structure was not segmented properly by MIA ( not detected or fused to a neighboring structure ) on N o v e m be r 12 , 2014 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published November 10 , 2014 JCB • VOLUME 207 • NUMBER 3 • 2014 432 Kramer , R .

( A ) TIRF images of a HeLa cell transfected with pDisplay - pHuji at pH 7 . 4 , 5 . 0 , and then 7 . 4 plus NH 4 Cl ( 50 mM ) , which reveals intracellular vesicles that are normally acidic ( yellow arrowheads ) , whereas diffuse fluorescence of proteins on the plasma membrane remains unchanged . ( B ) Fluorescence ratio of cells transfected with the indicated pDisplay - FP , in NH 4 + - containing versus control solution ( n = 3 – 5 cells ) . The ratios do not differ from unity , showing that no acidic intracellular organelle contributes to pDisplay - FP fluorescence . ( C ) Images at pH 7 . 4 and then pH 5 . 0 of the same cell as in A after 2 - min incubation with digitonin ( 50 µg / ml ) . Note the presence of bright puncta , which suggest that intracellular organelles were also permeabilized by digitonin and hence at the same pH as the bath solution . At pH 5 . 0 , similar to untreated cells , pHuji fluorescence is largely , but not completely , decreased .

( C ) Example of a scission event wrongly detected with SEP only using the original algo - rithm , despite a large fluorescence increase in the red channel ( TfR - pHuji raw pH 5 . 0 ) . This false negative resulted from a high level of background fluores - cence before the time of detection that precluded the detection of the individual vesicle at time 0 . The principle of detection of the new algorithm is to subtract the five preceding images for each frame to detect local increases of fluorescence ( minus background ) regardless of the surrounding noise . The ob - tained images are then thresholded to segment and track the thus detected objects ( segmented ) .

The number of postsynaptic AMPARs is regulated by a variety of trafficking processes among which endocytosis plays a key role in the expression of synaptic long term depression . This phenomenon has been proposed as a cellular correlate for learning and memory but its molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown . An important reason for this lack of understanding results from the fact that current imaging methods do not allow for the direct visualisation of vesicle formation at endocytic zones in those cells . Scientific contribution : We developed an imaging protocol enabling the detection of single endocytic vesicles within 2 s of their internalisation in living hippocampal neurons . Using this technique , we demonstrate that optically stable clathrin coated structures can undergo several rounds of consititutive and stimulated endocytosis . We also report for the first time the kinetics of NMDA induced internalisation of AMPARs . We found that even though a subset of endocytic zones appear to be tightly coupled to postsynaptic densities where AMPARs are concentrated , these spatially organised structures do not represent preferential internalisation sites , neither in basal conditions nor under plasticity inducing conditions . Conclusions & Perspectives : This new imaging method enables a direct visualisation of the activity of postsynaptic endocytic zones with great spatial and temporal resolution . It thus opens the way to a detailed study of the molecular determinants regulating basal and induced AMPAR internalisation .

However , the inability to detect single endocytic events in living neurons has hampered studies of its dynamics . We have developed a method to directly visualise the formation of individual endocytic vesicles loaded with pHluorin tagged receptors with high temporal resolution in dendrites of cultured hippocampal neurons . We show that the constitutively recycling transferrin receptor is efficiently internalised at optically static clathrin coated structures . Moreover , the frequency of internalisation events containing the synaptically enriched AMPA - type GluA2 receptor increases after application of NMDA , but these events are not enriched around synapses . We therefore demonstrate that endocytosis is a highly dynamic process in living neurons that can be readily studied using our protocol . Introduction Endocytosis is a fundamental process in neuronal function . Ongoing endocytosis regulates the number of AMPA receptors ( AMPARs ) at the postsynaptic level , and blocking this process specifically in a postsynaptic cell blocks NMDA receptor ( NMDAR ) dependent long term depression ( LTD ) at hippocampal excitatory synapses ( Lüscher et al . , 1999 ; Morishita et al . , 2005 ) . In cultured neurons , application of NMDA greatly enhances the internalisation of AMPARs via expression mechanisms apparently shared with synaptic LTD ( Lee et al . , 1998 ; Beattie et al . , 2000 ; Lee et al . , 2002 ) . Molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating postsynaptic AMPAR trafficking have thus been studied in great detail ( Anggono and Huganir , 2012 ) but key questions remain unanswered , such as where and how receptors are being internalised following NMDA stimulation . This issue is particularly relevant considering the synaptic specificity of LTD . Two extreme possibilities can indeed be envisaged . On the one hand , receptor endocytosis could be tightly regulated around stimulated synapses and contribute to such specificity . On the other hand , receptors could diffuse rapidly in the neuronal plasma membrane ( Choquet and Triller , 2013 ) and be internalised away from the depressed synapses . In this latter scenario , endocytosis , despite being necessary , would not contribute to the synaptic specificity of LTD . In favour of the first model , endocytic zones , i . e . clathrin coated structures ( CCSs ) , have been visualised in dendritic spines around the postsynaptic density ( PSD ) of excitatory synapses ( Blanpied et al . , 2002 ; Lu et al . , 2007 ; Rácz et al . , 2004 ) . Moreover , disruption of the putative link maintaining CCSs next to PSDs alters early phases of AMPAR endocytosis , but not that of transferrin , a classical marker of constitutive endocytosis ( Lu et al . , 2007 ) . In favour of the second model , ultrastructural studies seldom identify clathrin coated invaginations within spine heads but rather at the base of spine necks or in dendritic shafts ( Cooney et al . , 2002 ; Tao - Cheng et al . , 2011 ) . To provide a clear view of the dynamics of AMPAR endocytosis V ISUALISING E NDOCYTOSIS I N N EURONS 165 and distinguish between these two , non - exclusive , models , it would be necessary to detect the activity of endocytic zones together with their modulation during synaptic plasticity in living neurons . So far , AMPAR internalisation has been mostly studied using antibody feeding experiments . In such assays , neurons subjected to various treatments , including NMDA application , are incubated with antibodies directed against an extracellular epitope of endogenous or overexpressed AMPARs for typically 5 to 20 min . The cells are then fixed and the amount and localisation of internalised receptors is specifically revealed ( Carroll et al . , 1999 ; Beattie et al . , 2000 ; Ehlers , 2000 ; Lee et al . , 2002 , 2004 ; Rocca et al . , 2008 ; Glebov et al . , 2015 etc . ) . Although sensitive and quantitative , this method has a poor temporal resolution and does not provide accurate information on where receptors have been internalised . To provide a dynamic view of receptor internalisation , other studies have used pH - sensitive superecliptic pHluorin ( SEP ) tagged receptors and imaged transfected living neurons in culture . By monitoring endosome acidification following endocytosis , ligand induced internalisation of GPCRs ( Kotowski et al . , 2011 ; Jullié et al . , 2014 ) and NMDA induced internalisation of AMPARs ( Ashby et al . , 2004 ; Lin and Huganir , 2007 ) have be detected . However , under those conditions , a large fraction of SEP tagged AMPARs remains visible in intracellular compartments which were recently shown to acidify during NMDA application ( Rathje et al . , 2013 ) . The need to deconvolve between intracellular acidification and endocytosis thus complicates the interpretation of such data . Moreover , monitoring overall cellular fluorescence does not allow the deduction of the moment and localisation of endocytic vesicle formation . Therefore , a more resolutive method is needed to map the activity of endocytic zones in neuronal dendrites . Clathrin coated vesicle formation has been studied in great depth in immortalised cell lines , mostly by observing the disappearance of fluorescent clathrin from CCSs which signals the departure of a coated vesicle from the plasma membrane ( Merrifield et al . , 2002 ; Rappoport and Simon , 2003 ; Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ; Yarar et al . , 2005 ) . However , CCSs are largely static in neurons after one week in culture preventing such analysis in mature , plasticity competent cells ( Blanpied et al . , 2002 ) . Another method to visualise endocytic vesicle formation in cell lines , based on the visualisation of cargo loaded vesicles rather than on clathrin coat dynamics , also exists ( Merrifield et al . , 2005 ) . It is based on the reversible extinction of SEP fluorescence by periodic application of acidic solution to isolate every 4 s the fluorescence of internalised receptors protected from this transient pH change . Hence this so - called pulsed pH protocol ( ppH ) can reveal , with a temporal resolution of 2 s , the formation of endocytic vesicles at both disappearing and apparently stable CCSs . In the present study , we adapted the ppH protocol to make it usable on cultured hippocampal neurons . After validating these methodological adaptations , we assessed the endocytic activity of individual CCSs . We show that endocytic vesicles form Results 166 repetitively at optically static CCSs throughout neuronal dendrites , including a subset of CCSs adjacent to postsynaptic densities ( PSDs ) . We then examined in detail the behaviour of three receptors internalised through CCSs : the transferrin receptor ( TfR ) , which is constitutively internalised , the β2 - adrenergic receptor ( β2AR ) , which is robustly internalised after ligand binding , and the synaptically enriched AMPAR subunit GluA2 , the internalisation of which is greatly enhanced following stimulation with NMDA . We show that during NMDA application , the frequency of AMPAR endocytic events increases transiently , but that their localisation is distributed along the entire dendrite . Our results therefore suggest that AMPAR removal from synapses cannot be explained by a specific upregulation of the activity of endocytic zones localised adjacent to PSDs . Results The ppH protocol reveals the activity of CCSs in neurons To reveal the formation of individual endocytic vesicles , we have imaged with total internal reflection fluorecence microscopy ( TIRF ) hippocampal neurons in culture ( 14 - 21 DIV ) co - transfected with TfR - SEP and clathrin fused to mCherry ( Clc - mCh ) and applied the ppH protocol . The TfR - SEP receptors visible at pH 7 . 4 were colocalised with Clc - mCh , but most of this signal disappeared at pH 5 . 5 , revealing intracellular vesicles ( Figure 1A ) . The appearance of a spot in an image taken at pH 5 . 5 therefore indicates the formation of a clathrin coated vesicle ( CCV ) that pinched off from the plasma membrane during the preceding 2 s interval when the extracellular medium was at pH 7 . 4 ( Figure 1B ) . Endocytic events could be readily detected throughout the dendritic tree at a frequency of 5 , 3 . 10 - 2 ± 1 , 8 . 10 - 2 ev . min - 1 . µm - 2 ( n = 4 ) , with minimal run - down during a 10 min recording ( Figure 1C ) , indicating that this protocol does not adversely affect neurons . We further tested the effect of the ppH protocol on neuronal physiology . First we co - applied fluorescent transferrin ( Tfn - A568 , 5 µg / ml ) during the ppH protocol . Tfn - A568 colocalised with CCSs where TfR - SEP is concentrated and endocytic events can be recorded ( Figure S1A and B ) . Moreover , Tfn - A568 was internalised in a similar manner , whether or not neurons were subjected to the ppH protocol ( Figure S1C , D ) . Second , we recorded currents induced by the application of acidic solution during the ppH protocol , which are due to the opening of acid sensing ion channels and blocked by 500 µM amiloride ( Xiong et al . , 2004 ; Jullié et al . , 2014 ) ( Figure S1E and F ) . Amiloride did not change the frequency of scission events ( Figure S1G and H ) , indicating that the depolarisation induced by application of acidic solution does not affect TfR internalisation . Therefore we conclude that the ppH protocol does not affect constitutive endocytosis in neurons . To avoid any possible effect of depolarisation on modulating receptor internalisation , amiloride was added in all experiments where low pH solution was used , unless otherwise stated . V ISUALISING E NDOCYTOSIS I N N EURONS 167 Remarkably , despite the intense endocytic activity recorded with the ppH , CCSs visualised with Clc - mCh were very stable ( Figure 1D ) , with occasional appearance and disappearance of CCSs in the evanescent field . On average , there was very little variation of fluorescence in CCSs at the time of vesicle scission ( Figure 1E , F ) , which indicates that scission events cannot be detected solely by variations of clathrin fluorescence , and that the ppH protocol is necessary . Events can be sorted into terminal and non - terminal depending on the fact that a clathrin cluster disappears or remains visible 30 s after vesicle formation ( Merrifield et al . , 2005 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . Consistent with the apparent stability of CCSs , the great majority of scission events was non - terminal ( 86 . 3 ± 3 . 5 % , n = 4 ; see Methods for a discussion on the quantification ) . Because CCSs are stable in time , we wondered whether they could undergo several rounds of endocytosis . In the course of 10 minute recordings , ~ 9 % of all segmented CCSs gave rise to at least one detectable endocytic event . The average lifetime of these so - called " productive " CCSs ( 188 ± 35 s , n = 1165 in 4 cells ) was longer than that of " non - productive " CCSs ( 54 ± 6 s , n = 12080 ; p = 0 . 0105 ) , some of which even outlasting the duration of our recording . About half of the detected events originated from CCSs that persisted for more than 2 minutes ( Figure 1E ) and 15 . 5 ± 3 . 4 % of the so - called " productive " CCSs yielded 2 to 6 vesicles , demonstrating that despite their apparent stability , CCSs are constantly producing endocytic vesicles . The median interval between two consecutive events in the same CCSs was 111 . 6 s ( Figure 1H ) . To further asses that the detected events were indeed nascent CCVs , we imaged cells co - transfected with TfR - SEP and dynamin1 fused to mCherry ( Dyn1 - mCh ) , a protein essential for membrane fission ( Ferguson et al . , 2009 ) . Similarly as in non - neuronal cells ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) , Dyn1 - mCh is partly co - localised with TfR - SEP in dendrites ( Figure 1I ) and was maximally recruited at the time of endocytic vesicle formation ( Figure 1J ) . We conclude that the ppH protocol allows the detection of endocytic vesicles at optically stable CCS in mature neurons .

V ISUALISING E NDOCYTOSIS I N N EURONS 169 Ligand - induced recruitment and endocytosis of β2 adrenergic receptors at dendritic CCSs Neurons are highly polarised cells with a number of well - defined compartments . Therefore receptors targeted to endocytosis could be concentrated , or endocytic vesicles produced , in a subset of CCSs , as shown in other cell types ( Puthenveedu and von Zastrow , 2006 ; Soohoo and Puthenveedu , 2013 ) . We first examined this issue by visualising the endocytosis of the β2 adrenergic receptor ( β2AR ) , a G - protein coupled receptor which is robustly internalised in neurons following agonist binding and recycled back to the plasma membrane ( Yudowski et al . , 2006 ; Jullié et al . , 2014 ) . Under basal conditions , SEP - β2AR had a homogenous distribution on the plasma membrane of transfected neurons . Oppositely , receptors clustered at CCSs shortly after agonist application ( Figure 2A ) . SEP - β2AR fluorescence at productive CCSs increased ~ 2 - folds in the presence of isoproterenol ( n = 14 CCSs before and n = 87 CCSs during agonist application , analysis performed in 1 cell as proof of concept but data is available for 5 cells in total ) and the frequency of endocytic events detected with the ppH protocol increased 2 . 42 ± 0 . 58 - folds in the presence of agonist ( Figure 2B , C ) . However , we did not observe any clear segregation of receptors in a subset of CCSs . In particular , receptors were seen to be concentrated in CCSs located throughout the dendrites , both in the shaft and in spines . A systematic analysis of this parameter however still remains to be performed . Moreover , similarly to what we had observed with TfR - SEP , multiple rounds of endocytosis could be detected in some CCSs ( Figure 2D ) . Therefore , our data suggest that all CCSs appear to be capable of concentrating ligand - bound SEP - β2AR and the ppH protocol didn ' t reveal a defined subset of CCSs from which vesicles are formed . Further analysis of our dataset will be required to confirm this result . Results 170 Figure 2 : Formation of endocytic vesicles loaded with SEP - β2AR after application of isoproterenol ( A ) Portion of a dendrite of a neuron ( 16 DIV ) transfected with SEP - β2AR and Clc - DsRed before ( top ) and during ( bottom ) application of 20 µM isoproterenol .

Note the 2 - fold increase in fluorescence at pH 7 . 4 while the fluorescence contained inside vesicles detected at pH 5 . 5 is similar before and during agonist application . The endocytic activity of CCSs is not spatially regulated under basal conditions Previous studies have shown that many CCSs reside close to excitatory synapses ( Blanpied et al . , 2002 ; Lu et al . , 2007 ; Petrini et al . , 2009 ) . However , whether CCSs are actually enriched around synapses , as opposed to the dendritic shaft , has not been documented . To assess this point quantitatively , we co - transfected neurons with Homer1c - tdTomato , a marker of post - synaptic densities ( PSDs ) and Clc - GFP . We imaged those neurons with TIRF microscopy and segmented the two signals ( Figure 2A ) so as to measure the distances between the segmented CCS and the centre of the PSD ( Figure 2B ) or vice - versa ( Figure 2C ) . Overall , the distribution of distances between each CCS and their nearest PSD was not different from randomly scattered CCS and only 27 . 0 ± 1 . 7 % of all CCSs in dendrites were adjacent to a PSD ( i . e . closer than 300 nm , Figure 2B , blue line ) . However , this fraction of CCSs was closer to PSDs than what could be expected by chance . This means that CCSs are neither excluded from the shaft nor enriched in spines , but those that are in close proximity to PSDs appear to be tightly coupled to them . Conversely , the distance between each PSD and their nearest CCS was significantly smaller than if randomly scattered and 86 . 6 ± 1 . 5 % of PSDs were found V ISUALISING E NDOCYTOSIS I N N EURONS 171 less than 300 nm from a CCS ( Figure 2C ) . Therefore , a subset of CCSs can be found adjacent to PSDs , as previously shown ( Lu et al . , 2007 ) , but most of them are scattered throughout the dendrites . To assess whether the activity of this particular subset of CCSs was spatially regulated , we used the ppH protocol in neurons cotransfected with TfR - SEP and Homer1c - tdTomato . Endocytic events were detected in all parts of the dendrites , both adjacent to and far from PSDs ( Figure 2D ) . Overall , only 20 . 3 ± 6 . 6 % of events were located less than 300 nm from a PSD ( consistent with ~ 30 % of CCSs being concentrated there ) and the distribution of distances between events and PSDs was not different from random . These results indicate that all CCSs in neuronal dendrites are endocytically active , and that the constitutive activity of CCSs adjacent to PSDs is not specifically regulated under basal conditions .

Results 172 Endocytosis of AMPARs is stimulated during NMDA application We next wanted to detect the endocytosis of AMPARs for its importance in synaptic LTD ( Lüscher et al . , 1999 ; Morishita et al . , 2005 ) . Many aspects of this physiological event can be recapitulated in cultured neurons by the application of NMDA ( Beattie et al . , 2000 ; Lee et al . , 2002 ) . However , NMDARs are strongly inhibited by protons and they are completely blocked at pH 5 . 5 , the pH required to quench SEP fluorescence entirely ( Traynelis et al . , 1995 ) . We reasoned that the ppH protocol may prevent the induction of AMPAR endocytosis due to an inhibition of NMDARs . We therefore looked for an alternative way to quench extracellular SEP fluorescence . Several membrane impermeant molecules have been used to quench the fluorescence of GFP and other fluorophores ( Harata et al . , 2006 ; Park et al . , 2012 ; Valentine et al . , 2012 ) . We found that Trypan Purple almost completely quenched extracellular TfR - SEP fluorescence in a reversible manner ( Figure S2A ) and that it did not affect neuronal excitability ( Figure S2B ) . Consequently , it can be used to reveal endocytic events in a similar way as the ppH protocol , simply by replacing low pH solution with a solution containing 5 mM Trypan ( Figure S2C and D ) . We named this protocol pulsed - Trypan , or ‘pTry’ . The frequency of detected endocytic events was not significantly different using either the pTry or ppH protocol in 5 minute recordings ( Figure S2E ) , even though we noticed that in longer recordings , the frequency of detected events started to decrease , presumably because Trypan accumulates on the surface of the cell . We conclude that the pulsed - Trypan protocol is suitable to probe the endocytosis of receptors labelled with SEP . We therefore went on and designed a paradigm to monitor the endocytosis of AMPARs and its modulation during NMDA application using the pulsed - Trypan protocol ( Figure 4A ) . The fluorescence of neurons transfected with SEP - GluA2 and unlabelled - GluA1 was distributed throughout the neuronal membrane , including spines and PSDs labelled with Homer1c - tdTomato . However , when Trypan was applied to these neurons , the fluorescence was only partially quenched , especially in the dendritic shaft . A similar result was obtained with a solution at pH 5 . 5 and is consistent with the presence of AMPARs in a non - acidic intracellular compartment ( also see ( Rathje et al . , 2013 ) ) . To reduce this residual background fluorescence , we bleached intracellular receptors with wide - field epifluorescent illumination for 10 - 30 s . During this step , neurons were bathed in pH 5 . 5 solution ( in the presence of amiloride ) to render SEP - tagged receptors located on the plasma membrane non - fluorescent , thus sparing them from bleaching . Neurons were then allowed to recover in normal solution for 10 minutes . Finally , they were subjected to the imaging paradigm presented in Figure 4A consisting of 3 minutes of pTry protocol ( baseline ) , 10 minutes of rest , 3 minutes of pTry using solutions containing 20 µM NMDA , 10 µM glycine and 0 . 3 mM Mg2 + ( stimulation ) , 10 minutes of rest , and 3 minutes of pTry ( washout ) . In these conditions , we detected endocytic events in dendritic shafts , occasionally at the base of spines and even more rarely in spine heads ( Figure 4B ) . The frequency of events increased during NMDA application V ISUALISING E NDOCYTOSIS I N N EURONS 173 ( although not significantly , p = 0 . 2878 in n = 5 cells ) , and came back to pre - stimulation values after 10 minutes ( washout ) . Taking advantage of the high temporal resolution of the pTry protocol , we could monitor the kinetics of this increase in frequency during the application of NMDA . We found that the detection of endocytic vesicles increased gradually within 1 to 2 minutes after the start of the stimulation ( Figure 4D ) . We then mapped endocytic events with regards to synapses but observed no preferential internalisation in the proximity of PSDs as compared to randomly scattered events in any of the conditions ( Figure 4E ) . To investigate whether the increased internalisation rate of AMPARs following the application of NMDA was due to a regulation of constitutive endocytosis , we applied the same paradigm to TfR - SEP expressing neurons , with the slight modification that photobleaching was not necessary in this case . Unlike SEP - GluA2 receptors , the frequency of endocytic events detected with TfR - SEP decreased during and after NMDA application ( Figure 4F ) . This decrease was continuous , including during stimulation ( Figure 4G ) . Finally , the location of internalisation events was not biased around PSDs neither under basal conditions , consistent with our results obtained with the ppH ( Figure 3 ) , nor during or after application of NMDA ( Figure 4H ) . We conclude from these experiments that NMDA stimulated internalisation of AMPARs is not regulated by an increased activity of the subset of CCSs located in the vicinity of synapses .

V ISUALISING E NDOCYTOSIS I N N EURONS 175 Discussion In order to investigate the spatio - temporal dynamics of clathrin mediated endocytosis in neuronal dendrites we have developed a new imaging method enabling the detection of single endocytic vesicles in living hippocampal neurons . The endocytic activity of CCS can be observed in mature neurons in culture The ppH protocol was originally designed in cell lines with the aim of gaining temporal resolution with regards to the precise timing of vesicle formation . While reaching this goal efficiently , it also unexpectedly revealed the existence of endocytic events occurring in the absence of a concomitant disappearance of clathrin . Despite this major difference with canonical endocytic events , these forming vesicles were shown to recruit with similar kinetics all the major characterised classes of proteins associated with CME ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . The analogy between those events and the long standing dilemma observed in mature neurons neurons , where CME is known to play a major role in synaptic plasticity even though clathrin itself appears to be static at the light microscopy level , led us to apply the ppH protocol in neurons . Using this method , we demonstrate that constitutive endocytosis occurs throughout the dendritic arborisation and that single , long lived clathrin coated structures can undergo several rounds of endocytosis while remaining optically stable . The events detected with the ppH protocol are indeed bona fide newly formed endocytic vesicles as confirmed by the recruitment of dynamin 1 2 s prior to detection ( the exact timing observed in cell lines , ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) ) as well as the increase in frequency of detected SEP - β2AR events in the presence of its ligand isoproterenol . Such endocytic activity of CCSs in neurons had largely remained undetected and it is possible that clathrin stability may be the rule in many cells with highly organised compartments such as focal adhesion sites ( Batchelder and Yarar , 2010 ) and microvilli ( Boulant et al . , 2011 ) in epithelial cells or costameres in muscle cells ( Vassilopoulos et al . , 2014 ) . The pulsed - pH protocol therefore is an important tool to visualise the activity of optically long lived endocytic zones . CCSs equally internalise receptors in all areas of the dendrites Even though spines and associated PSDs appear to be enriched in endocytic zones , as previously shown ( Lu et al . , 2007 ) , we found that the reverse observation does not hold true . CCSs , which greatly outnumber PSDs , are thus randomly scattered throughout the dendritic tree . Importantly , using TfR - SEP as a marker for constitutive endocytosis , we could detect endocytic events originating from CCSs located both in the shaft and in close proximity to PSDs . It could be argued that the use of TIRF illumination , which only excites fluorophores ~ 200 nm above the adhering plasma membrane , does not allow for the imaging of functionally important compartments of Results 176 the neuron . We could have therefore underestimated the number of vesicles forming in some parts of neuronal dendrites , and in particular around synapses . Nevertheless , we obtained an estimate of 85 % of PSDs ( imaged with classical epifluorescent illumination ) exhibiting an adjacent CCS ( imaged with TIRF illumination ) , in close agreement with previous estimates obtained with confocal imaging ( Lu et al . , 2007 ) . Therefore , we should be able to detect in our recording conditions at least a fraction of endocytic vesicles created in neuronal dendrites , with no bias towards missing synaptic and peri - synaptic events . NMDA induced AMPAR internalisation is not mediated by a modulation of CME NMDAR mediated internalisation of AMPARs has been proposed to be one of the mechanisms leading to synaptic LTD , a putative cellular correlate of learning and memory ( Malinow and Malenka , 2002 ) . Two models for the regulation of AMPAR internalisation have emerged from the literature on the subject . The presence of clathrin labelled endocytic zones in the majority of synapses of living neurons suggests that a sustained endocytic activity occurring within the spine head may regulate local AMPAR trafficking ( Blanpied et al . , 2002 ; Lu et al . , 2007 ) . On the other hand , ultrastructural studies seldom observe AMPAR labelled CCSs in synaptic profiles , although this proportion increases during LTD ( Cooney et al . , 2002 ; Tao - Cheng et al . , 2011 ) , suggesting that AMPARs are not preferentially endocytosed at these locations . Deciphering whether the activity of synaptic endocytic zones is spatially regulated could provide insight on the mechanisms underlying the synaptic specificity of LTD . Using a variant of the ppH protocol , we were able to visualise the formation of single AMPAR containing vesicles . We showed that the frequency of such endocytic events increased as soon as the cells were stimulated with NMDA . This kinetics profile is consistent with results obtained with antibody feeding assays in which 1 min of NMDAR activation was enough to trigger AMPAR endocytosis ( Carroll et al . , 1999 ; Ehlers , 2000 ) . Our results however provide evidence that internalisation itself is initiated as early as the stimulation starts , a point that could not be ascertained by fixing the cells 5 to 20 minutes after NMDA application as was the case in those studies . Also , the absence of colocalisation between AMPAR and TfR 5 minutes after the start of the antibody feeding assay has been proposed to show that these two receptors are differentially internalised ( Glebov et al . , 2015 ) . It should however be noted that the temporal resolution of this assay does not allow for such conclusions given that it does not pinpoint the site of vesicle formation . The lack of overlap between AMPARs and TfRs in endosomes could thus reflect a rapid sorting step rather than a differential internalisation from the plasma membrane . Notably , other groups have obtained contradictory results regarding the sorting of AMPARs throughout the endosomal system ( Beattie et al . , 2000 ; Ehlers , 2000 ; Lee et al . , 2004 ) . The ppH protocol should therefore prove a better tool to investigate this question . V ISUALISING E NDOCYTOSIS I N N EURONS 177 The rapid timecourse of NMDA induced internalisation of AMPAR is to be opposed to that observed for isoproterenol induced internalisation of SEP - β2AR . We indeed showed that the latter only started 2 minutes after arrival of the agonist , longer than our estimated time for solution exchange of 20 - 30 s . These different kinetic profiles may potentially reflect the necessity for β2ARs to concentrate to CCSs before being internalised . It is also possible that these receptors are maintained surface bound for some time before internalisation is triggered , hypothetically for signalling purposes ( Henry et al . , 2012 ; Shen et al . , 2014 ) . On the other hand , synapses are enriched in both AMPARs and CCSs . This organisation therefore reduces the need for an initial step of clusterisation . However , despite this spatial arrangement of AMPARs and CCSs around PSDs , we did not observe any preferential internalisation of either AMPARs or TfRs at these sites . We therefore conclude that the activity of synaptic endocytic zones is not regulated by NMDAR activation and that the increased internalisation rate of AMPARs is probably due to modifications of the receptor itself such as phosphorylation or unbinding from protein interactors ( Chung et al . , 2000 ; Lee et al . , 2002 ; Tomita et al . , 2004 ; Constals et al . , 2015 ) . Finally , in the more physiological context of synaptically induced LTD , a small fraction of synapses are being modified . The receptors associated to these depressed synapses could be targeted to their closest CCS , thus spatially limiting their internalisation . More precise protocols associating synaptic stimulation and endocytic vesicle formation will be needed to address this issue . Perspectives The results presented in this article in preparation provide insights on the regulation of CME in the somatodendritic compartment of mature neurons . Some aspects however remain to be investigated before further conclusions are drawn . First , we noticed a discrepancy between the apparent stability of the clathrin signal as observed by visual inspection and kymograph analysis and the high number of short lived structures detected by our segmentation algorithm despite the use of a gapclosing algorithm . We would therefore like to search for potential tracking errors to increase the robustness of our analysis . Second , a systematic analysis of the clustering of β2AR to CCSs such as performed in ( Shen et al . , 2014 ) would be necessary to confirm that the receptor indeed concentrates to all CCSs . A further analysis such as was done with the TfR could also provide insight on the localisation and repetition of vesicle formation at given CCSs . Third , it cannot be excluded that the decreased internalisation rate of TfR during NMDA application could be an artefact of our imaging paradigm . Oppositely , the increased internalisation rate of AMPARs could be due to chance since it relies on a small number of observations and falls short of statistical significance . Also , preliminary electrophysiological recordings indicated that Trypan purple can partially inhibit NMDAR induced currents , hinting to the possibility that the pTry protocol may prevent the induction of chemical LTD . We therefore need to complement our study with classical antibody - feeding assays to ensure that Trypan Purple does not affect this process . Moreover , our last set of experiments needs to be performed again in the Results 178 presence of APV , an NMDAR antagonist , in order to assess the involvement of NMDAR activation in inducing the effects we have observed . If our results are confirmed , it would however be interesting to investigate how NMDAR activation may downregulate constitutive CME at the cellular level . Finally , to investigate on a potential spatial regulation of CME , we have focused our attention on PSDs as labelled by Homer1c . Using this marker , we did not find any conclusive evidence that either receptor could be preferentially internalised at synapses . However , a visual inspection of endocytic events raised the impression that some vesicles formed at the base of spines . Ultrastructural studies have also shown that invaginated CCSs could be readily observed in those locations to a much higher frequency than in spine heads ( Cooney et al . , 2002 ) . Coming back to our dataset , it is interesting to note that on average , AMPAR filled vesicles seemed to form closer to PSDs 10 min after stimulation ( mean = 687 ± 218 nm ) as compared to baseline ( mean = 990 ± 157 nm , p = 0 . 1497 ) . When observing the distribution of distances from the nearest PSD ( Figure 4E ) we saw that AMPARs did not internalise less than 300 nm away from a PSD more than chance and concluded that there was no spatial regulation of CME at those sites . However , the cumulative plot of distances measured during the washout phase ( Figure 4E , light green curve ) is shifted towards smaller distances than random around 700 nm . Even though the low number of detections of AMPAR endocytic events probably does not allow for a robust conclusion on the matter , it is possible that this distance corresponds to the average distance between PSDs and the base of a spine neck . Hypothetically , this location could be a preferential site for the internalisation of AMPARs following NMDAR activation .

Experimental procedures Primary neuronal cultures and transfection Neurons were prepared and cultured following the Banker protocol ( Kaech and Banker , 2006 ) . In brief , dissociated hippocampal neurons from embryonic day 18 rat embryos were plated on 18 mm polylysine - coated glass coverslips at a density of 250 V ISUALISING E NDOCYTOSIS I N N EURONS 179 000 cells / ml in MEM containing 10 % horse serum ( Invitrogen ) for 3 h , then cultured in Neurobasal medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine and 10 % Neuromix ( PAA ) , B27 ( Gibco ) or SM1 supplement ( Stem Cell ) on a feeder layer of glial cells at 37°C in 5 % CO2 for 7 to 21 days . Neurons were transfected at 6 - 8 DIV with 1 - 4 µg total DNA , using Effectene ( Qiagen ) following the company protocol . For experiments with SEP - GluA2 under the control of the tetracyclin promoter ( tet - ON ) , doxycyclin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was added 2 days before imaging ( 2µg / mL final concentration ) . TfR - SEP , SEP - β2AR , Clc - mCh , Clc - DsRed and Homer1c - tdTomato plasmids were the same as described previously ( Jullié et al . , 2014 ; Merrifield et al . , 2005 ; Petrini et al . , 2009 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . SEP - GluA2 was obtained by inserting SEP after the signal peptide of rat GluA2 coding sequence using AgeI / NheI restriction sites . This SEP - GluA2 insert was cloned into the pBI - Tet - on vector ( Clontech ) by MluI and EcoRI . AP - GluA1 was generated by introducing an AP tag ( GGCCTGAACGACATCTTCGAGGCCCAGA - AGATCGAGTGGCACGAG ) on the N - terminal part of rat GluA1 after the signal peptide . The AP - GluA1 insert was cloned in a pSynAAV vector ( expression under the human Synapsin promoter ) between EcoRI / HindIII restriction sites . Neurons were transfected at 7 - 9 DIV except when expressing Dyn1 - mCh ( transfected at DIV 13 ) using Effectene ( Qiagen ) following the company protocol . Neurons transfected with SEP - GluA2 were systematically co - transfected with a transactivator plasmid ( Clontech ) to allow for the inducible expression of the protein by doxicycline as well as with AP - GluA1 to favour the heterodimerisation of the overexpressed AMPAR subunits . Fluorescence Imaging Imaging was performed at 35 °C on a TIRF microscope previously described ( Shen et al . , 2014 ) . Cells were perfused with HEPES buffered saline solution ( HBS ) with , in mM : 120 NaCl , 2 KCl , 2 MgCl 2 , 2 CaCl 2 , 3 Na 2 - Ascorbate , 5 D - glucose and 10 HEPES , and adjusted to pH 7 . 4 and 265 - 280 mosm . For the ppH protocol , MES buffered saline solutions ( MBS ) were prepared similarly by replacing HEPES with MES and adjusting the pH to 5 . 5 . ( Salts were from Sigma Aldrich unless otherwise stated ) . Solutions were supplemented with 0 . 5 µM TTX and 2 % v / v Neuromix ( PAA laboratories ) or B27 ( Gibco ) on the day of the experiment . For the pTry protocol , 5 mM Trypan purple ( Interchim ) were dissolved in HBS . Chemical LTD was induced by using an HBS solution containing 0 . 3 mM MgCl 2 supplemented with 20 µM NMDA ( Abcam ) and 10 µM Glycine . Patch - clamp recordings Recording pipettes ( resistance , 3 - 5 MΩ ) were filled with a solution containing the following ( in mM ) : 110 KCH 3 SO 3 , 2 KCl , 1 EGTA , 0 . 1 CaCl 2 , 10 HEPES , 4 Mg x ATP , 0 . 4 Na x GTP and 5 Na 2 Phosphocreatine , adjusted to pH 7 . 2 with KOH ( 250 - 260 mOsm ) . Cells were recorded in the same conditions as for fluorescence imaging and voltage clamped at - 60 mV with an EPC10 patch - clamp amplifier ( Heka ) . Current amplitudes were measured at their peak using the software Igor ( Wavemetrics ) . Results 180 Image analysis Semi - automatic detection of endocytic events was performed as described previously for cell lines ( Shen et al . , 2014 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . In neurons , the proportion of automatically detected events validated by the user by visual inspection ( ~ 50 % ) was smaller than for other cells ( ~ 80 % ) . Indeed , we saw a greater contribution of moving intracellular vesicles presumably because transport tracks in small dendrites are closer to the membrane than in larger cell bodies , and vesicles travelling along them become visible within the field of TIRF illumination . In addition , we saw a sizeable amount of exocytic events ( characterised by the sudden appearance of fluorescence at pH 7 . 4 ) , followed by the appearance of the same organelle at pH 5 . 5 . We have characterised this type of ‘kiss - and - run’ event previously ( Jullié et al . , 2014 ) . These events are independent of clathrin and dynamin , thus independent of clathrin mediated endocytosis , and were not included in this study . Fluorescence quantification of events was performed as in ( Shen et al . , 2014 ) with the minor modification that events were classified as terminal or non - terminal depending on whether 36 s after their detection , the clathrin fluorescence at their site of detection was less than 40 % ( terminal ) or more than 60 % ( non terminal ) its fluorescence 12 s prior to detection . The proportion of non - terminal events when quantified as in ( Shen et al . , 2014 ) based on the fluorescence of TfR - SEP instead of clathrin is even greater ( 92 . 4 ± 2 . 5 % ) . Lifetime measurements of CCSs was performed on images acquired at pH 5 . 5 to reduce the contribution of TfR - SEP surface clusters due to spectral bleedthrough from the green to the red channel . After segmentation of those images and tracking of the CCSs , a gap closing algorithm was applied to reconnect tracks if a CCS was detected within 8 seconds in a 300 nm radius from an arrested track . An endocytic event was considered as originating from a CCS if it was detected less than 750 nm away from its centre . Data representation Cumulative frequency plots were normalised to 100 for each cell at a chosen timepoint so as to pool the kinetics of several cells subjected to the same treatment in a single curve despite variability in their basal endocytic activity . This timepoint was chosen as being the end of baseline recordings ( 10 min for Figure 1C , 3 min for Figures 2C , 4D and 4G and 5 minutes for Figure S1G ) . The fluorescence of Tfn - A568 ( Life Technologies ) for Tfn uptake experiments was similarly normalised to 100 for each cell 1 min after the start of the recording ( Figure S1D ) . V ISUALISING E NDOCYTOSIS I N N EURONS 181 Cumulative distance plots were obtained by measuring the Euclidian distance between the centre of an object A ( a CCS , a PSD or an event ) and the closest pixel identified in segmented images as belonging to an object B ( a PSD or a CCS ) . Randomised data sets were obtained by generating 1000 cumulative plots of distances for n A randomly scattered objects , where n A is the number of objects A actually detected . Distributions falling within the 95 highest and lowest percentiles of this dataset were considered as not being different from chance . When indicated , statistical p - values were obtained using 2 - tail paired student t - tests except in for the comparison of CCS lifetimes and in Figure S2E for which a 2 - tail homoscedastic student t - test was used .

Among these proteins , the large GTPase dynamin is of particular importance for its well established role in mediating membrane scission resulting in the separation of the new born vesicle from the plasma membrane . Preventing the recruitment of dynamin to its site of action results in the arrest of endocytic pits at a deeply invaginated stage . On the other hand , functional perturbations of its catalytic activity have suggested that it may also regulate clathrin assembly at much earlier stages . Scientific contribution : We propose that inhibiting endocytosis by acutely interfering with dynamin recruitment will make it possible to decipher whether its presence is required at early stages of vesicle formation . In order to develop a potent , dynamin - derived photoactivatable inhibitor of endocytosis , we have produced and characterised a library of biomimetic peptides . By a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments , we show that multivalent peptides bind dynamin interactors with high avidity and that this correlates with an increased inhibitory activity in living cells . We also show as proof of principle that endocytosis can be acutely inhibited by UV - uncaging of non hydrolysable GTP and discuss possible caging strategies compatible with peptide synthesis . Conclusions & Perspectives : Taken together , our results highlight the importance of multimeric interactions between dynamin and its recruiting partners . Taking advantage of this characteristic , we plan on optimising further the inhibitory efficiency of our candidate peptides before studying the temporal pattern of recruitment of dynamin to endocytic sites using a photoactivatable version of the most potent one . Being able to acutely block endocytosis in a spatially restricted area may also help with deciphering the contribution of clathrin mediated endocytosis in defining the synaptic specificity of long term depression in neurons .

Clathrin and dynamin dependent endocytosis has been implicated in many fundamental cellular processes ranging from nutrient uptake to neurotransmission . In order to decipher the finer details of dynamin - driven vesicle formation , we are developing a photoactivatable blocker of endocytosis . Using a library of dynamin derived peptides , we found that the repetition of SH3 - binding motifs increases the affinity for amphiphysin , the major interactor of dynamin . When dialysed in living cells , these high affinity peptides effectively block endocytosis within minutes . We also set up a protocol for photoactivation using a caged version of the non - specific endocytosis blocker GTPγS and show that a one second light - pulse is enough to immediately and robustly inhibit vesicle formation . Introduction Clathrin mediated endocytosis ( CME ) is a fundamental process of all eukaryotic cells and is implicated in nutrient uptake , cell motility , cell signalling and neurotransmission . The first step in this process consists in the formation of cargo loaded vesicles budding off from the plasma membrane . The invagination of a clathrin coated pit ( CCP ) and the scission reaction forming a new clathrin coated vesicle ( CCV ) are tightly regulated by a stereotyped series of protein - protein interaction involving tens of accessory and regulatory proteins ( McMahon and Boucrot , 2011 ) . In metazoans , the protein mediating vesicle scission is dynamin , a large GTPase which can constrict and break the neck of forming vesicles by oligomerising into a ring - like structure ( Ferguson and De Camilli , 2012 ) . The C - terminal proline and arginine rich domain of dynamin ( dyn - PRD ) is a major interaction hub for Src - homology - 3 ( SH3 ) - domain containing endocytic accessory protein ( Meinecke et al . , 2013 ) . An important interaction partner of dynamin is the SH3 and BIN - Amphiphysin - Rvs ( BAR ) domain containing protein amphiphysin . Amphiphysin homo - dimerises into crescent shaped structures via its BAR domain providing it with a preferential binding affinity for curved membranes ( Peter , 2004 ; McMahon and Gallop , 2005 ) . Targeting this interaction appears to be a good option to spatially and temporally control the recruitment of dynamin to the neck of nascent vesicles . Inhibiting CME is widely used to understand the molecular mechanisms regulating this process and its roles in cell physiology ( von Kleist and Haucke , 2012 ) . Because CME relies heavily on key protein - protein interactions to proceed , truncated protein - domains or biomimetic peptides have been used to sequester one of the interacting partners away from its site of action . For example , peptides mimicking part of amphiphysin or β - arrestin , which bind to clathrin adaptor protein β2 subunit of the AP - 2 complex ( Praefcke et al . , 2004 ; Edeling et al . , 2006 ) , have been used to inhibit C AGED P EPTIDES T O B LOCK E NDOCYTOSIS 191 endocytosis in neurons ( Jockusch et al . , 2005 ; Hosoi et al . , 2009 ; Wu et al . , 2009 ) . Also , expressing amphiphysin ' s SH3 domain in COS - 7 cells ( Wigge et al . , 1997 ) or injecting it in giant reticulospinal synapses ( Shupliakov , 1997 ) blocks endocytic vesicle formation . Similarly , injection of a 15 amino - acid long peptide sequence derived from the dyn - PRD and binding to amphiphysin in neurons blocked vesicle formation in the pre - ( Shupliakov , 1997 ; Jockusch et al . , 2005 ; Yamashita et al . , 2005 ) and post - synaptic compartments ( Lüscher et al . , 1999 ; Kittler et al . , 2000 ; Morishita et al . , 2005 ; Linden , 2012 ; Glebov et al . , 2015 ) . Finally , screenings for small organic molecules interfering with either clathrin or dynamin function have identified pitstops , which interfere with clathrin binding ( von Kleist et al . , 2011 ) and dynasore ( Macia et al . , 2006 ) or its derivatives , such as Dyngo 4a ( McCluskey et al . , 2013 ) , which block the GTPase activity of dynamin . These small organic molecules however also have other cellular targets ( Park et al . , 2013 ) . Interestingly , interfering with different molecules leads to a blockade of endocytosis at various stages of CCP invagination . Such observations provide insight on the temporal requirement for the protein being interfered with . For example , cells treated with Pitstops display a variety of endocytic pit profiles , consistent with clathrin playing a role at all stages in the pathway ( von Kleist et al . , 2011 ) . Conversely , interfering with dynamin ' s GTPase activity or recruitment leads to an accumulation of constricted pits , consistent with its role in membrane fission ( Shupliakov , 1997 ; Macia et al . , 2006 ) . However , photoinactivation of dynamin by fluorophore assisted light inactivation ( FALI ) , acting within seconds rather than minutes or hours , prevented the proper localisation of clathrin and induced the formation of large vacuoles in drosophila nerve terminals ( Kasprowicz et al . , 2014 ) . These results therefore support the existence of an early role of dynamin in CCP assembly . This idea of a dual role of dynamin is supported by advanced imaging techniques showing that dynamin is present at CCPs early in their maturation process ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ; Aguet et al . , 2013 ) . It is also consistent with the effects of overexpressed GTPase deficient mutants of dynamin on cargo uptake , which suggest a GTP dependent regulation of CCP constriction by dynamin before scission occurs ( Sever et al . , 2000 ) . In order to gain insight on this controversy , we worked towards the development of a dynamin derived photoactivatable blocker of endocytosis . By acutely perturbing the interaction between endogenous dynamin and its partner amphiphysin without inactivating it entirely , we may be able to assess at which stage ( s ) of the endocytic pathway the presence of dynamin is required . We report here the design , synthesis and characterisation of optimised blockers of endocytosis derived from the dyn - PRD sequence . We demonstrate by a combination of biophysical and live cell assays that the presence of multiple SH3 - interaction sites on those peptides increases both their affinity or avidity for amphiphysin and their efficiency in inhibiting CCV formation in living cells . We also show preliminary data indicating that temporal control of endocytosis can be achieved in combination with our experimental paradigm . Using a Results 192 caged version of the non - hydrolysable nucleotide GTPγS , commonly used to non - specifically block endocytosis ( Jockusch et al . , 2005 ; Yamashita et al . , 2005 ) , we were able to robustly inhibit the formation of CCVs with a 1 s pulse of UV light . When put in combination , these advances should lead to the development of a novel tool for a detailed understanding of dynamin function in CME . Results The D15 peptide as a template for the design of a photoactivatable blocker of endocytosis The C - terminal PRD of dynamin has been extensively studied in order to dissect its patterns and its sequences of interaction with the many SH3 - domain containing proteins involved in endocytosis such as amphiphysin , endophilin , intersectin or SNX9 ( Gout et al . , 1993 ; Simpson et al . , 1999 ; Solomaha et al . , 2005 ; Meinecke et al . , 2013 ; Neumann and Schmid , 2013 ) . Consensus SH3 binding motifs can be categorised into 3 classes : simple PXXP motifs or PXXP motifs flanked by positively charged amino - acids in the N - or C - direction so as to form Class I + XXPXXP motifs and Class II PXXPX + motifs , where P are prolines , X can be any amino - acid and + stand for either lysine ( K ) or arginine ( R ) ( Zarrinpar et al . , 2003 ) . In vitro studies have mapped the dynamin - amphiphysin interaction at a single site within the dyn - PRD and revealed the importance of two overlapping Class II interaction motifs so as to form a PQVPSRPNR motif ( Grabs et al . , 1997 ) . This finding led to the design of the D15 peptide ( PPPQVPSRPNRAPPG ) which endocytosis blocking activity has been widely demonstrated in living neurons ( Shupliakov , 1997 ; Lüscher et al . , 1999 ; Kittler et al . , 2000 ; Jockusch et al . , 2005 ; Morishita et al . , 2005 ; Hosoi et al . , 2009 ; Wu et al . , 2009 ; Linden , 2012 ; Glebov et al . , 2015 ) . Its high specificity for amphiphysin as well as its efficacy in inhibiting endocytosis as reported in the literature therefore made us consider it as a template for the design of a photoactivatable blocker . We however reasoned that its rather low affinity for its target amphiphysin , reported K D ≈ 100 µM as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry ( Jockusch et al . , 2005 ) , may be an obstacle to obtaining a potent blocker after photoactivation . Indeed , in order to efficiently compete against the endogenous dynamin - amphiphysin interaction , D15 is commonly used at 1 - 2 mM in a dialysing solution ( Lüscher et al . , 1999 ; Jockusch et al . , 2005 ; Hosoi et al . , 2009 ) . Considering that experimental yields of photoactivation are usually rather low ( a few percent only ( Ellis - Davies , 2007 ) ) , we prospected that a photoactivatable D15 may have to be used at 10 mM or more . On top of raising practical difficulties such as heavy loads of chemical synthesis and potential solubility issues , using such high concentrations of a compound in cells may induce off - target effects . We therefore started this study by searching for an optimised endocytosis blocker . C AGED P EPTIDES T O B LOCK E NDOCYTOSIS 193 Rational design of optimised blockers of endocytosis To increase the affinity of D15 derived peptides for the SH3 domain of amphiphysin 1 , we followed three strategies , illustrated in Figure 1 : a mutation strategy , an elongation strategy and a dimerisation strategy . First , the mutation strategy builds up on the screening of a combinatorial library of peptides by ( Grabs et al . , 1997 ) who found that amphiphysin would preferentially bind to a non - canonical PXRPXRR motif over the PXRPXRX motif found in D15 . Moreover , ( Landgraf et al . , 2004 ) showed by whole interactome scanning experiments that a putative protein fragment containing such a PXRPXRR motif was the best polyproline based interactor of amphiphysin 1 and endophilin 1 among the entire human genome . Second , the elongation strategy is based on the evidence that isolated amphiphysin 1 SH3 domains ( amph - SH3 ) bind with high affinity to the extreme 44 amino - acid long C - terminal fragment of dyn1 - PRD ( K D ≈ 10 - 25 nM according to ( Solomaha et al . , 2005 ) ) . This fragment contains the D15 sequence as well as two other consensus SH3 - binding sites . These extra binding sites may be responsible for the observed increased affinity of this fragment for amph - SH3 . Third , the dimerisation strategy relied on the concept that multimeric interactions are a common feature of the protein - protein interactions regulating CME . Just as clathrin lattice expansion ( Schmid et al . , 2006 ) and accessory protein recruitment ( Olesen et al . , 2008 ) have been proposed to rely on a competition between high affinity and high avidity interactions , we reasoned that the binding of dynamin to amphiphysin may be facilitated by the fact that both form multimers once recruited to the neck of forming vesicles . Therefore , a dimeric peptide may more efficiently compete with the endogenous interaction than a monomeric one . This idea is supported by the in vitro demonstration that Grb2 , a protein containing 2 SH3 domains , binds more efficiently to a dimeric polyproline peptide than to its monomeric homolog ( Cussac et al . , 1999 ; de Mol et al . , 2013 ) . To date , dimeric peptides have however never been used to interfere with endocytosis in living cells . We thus synthesised a library of peptides according to these three strategies by solid phase peptide synthesis . All peptides were obtained with satisfying yields and high purity ( Figure S1 , Table S1 ) . For the mutation strategy , we synthesised D15 and the peptide identified by ( Landgraf et al . , 2004 ) which we named AL14 ( for amphiphysin ligand , 14 amino - acids long ) . For the elongation strategy , we synthesised a series of truncation fragments : D44 , C - D25 and N - D30 , where the number corresponds to the length of the peptide in amino - acids , and N - or C - to the direction of the extension relative to the D15 sequence . For the dimerisation strategy , we synthesised a library of 6 dimeric peptides varying in linker length and orientation : N - P3 - [ D15 ] 2 , N - P2 - [ D15 ] 2 , N - P1 - [ D15 ] 2 , C - P3 - [ D15 ] 2 , C - P2 - [ D15 ] 2 and C - P1 - [ D15 ] 2 , where N - or C - represents by which end the two monomers are being linked and P1 , P2 or P3 refers to the number of PEG spacing motifs used to vary the length of the linker .

RXXPXXP Class I interaction motifs and PXXPXR Class II interaction motifs are highlighted ( B ) Sequence alignment between D15 and AL14 . The two extra arginines may increase the affinity of AL14 for amphiphysin as compared to D15 . ( C ) The elongation strategy consists in testing various truncations of dyn1 - PRD around the original D15 sequence . Additional Class I and Class II interaction motifs may participate in improving the affinity / avidity of the resulting peptides for amphiphysin . ( D ) Several models of spatial arrangements of amphiphysin can be envisaged from structural data . ( Left ) proposed " inhibited conformation " of SH3 domains lying close to positively charged areas of a BAR dimer as modelled in Rao et al . , 2010 . ( Right ) putative " active conformation " induced by membrane binding ( grey ) inspired from a proposed model of spatial arrangement for endophilin SH3 domains ( Mim et al . , 2012 ) ( E ) The dimerisation strategy consists in duplicating the D15 motif to potentially increase its avidity for dimers of amphiphysin . Dimeric peptides may be linked via their N - or C - terminus and the length of the linker between the monomers may be varied for further optimisation using 1 , 2 or 3 PEG motifs ( ~ 25 Å each ) per monomer . Tyrosines ( Y , green ) were added to all our synthesised peptides for estimation of peptide concentration by UV ( 280 nm wavelength ) absorbance . C AGED P EPTIDES T O B LOCK E NDOCYTOSIS 195 Elongated and dimerci peptides bind to SH3 domain containing proteins in vitro We first tested by affinity - based isolation assays ( pulldowns ) whether these optimisation strategies could qualitatively improve the binding of the peptides to amphiphysin or other proteins involved in endocytosis . We found that AL14 did not isolate any detectable amount of protein suggesting that the mutation strategy is not enough to improve the peptide ' s binding to amphiphysin ( Figure 2A ) . On the other hand , dynamin derived peptides issuing from the elongation and dimerisation strategies , namely D44 and N - P3 - [ D15 ] 2 , could isolate proteins that the D15 peptide could not to detectable levels in the same conditions ( Figure 2B and C ) . The bands obtained with D44 and N - P3 - [ D15 ] 2 included a clear staining around 70 - 75 kDa , the awaited molecular weight for amphiphysin . Also , the band patterns observed could be robustly reproduced in various trials and were strikingly similar for both optimised peptides , suggesting a common mode of binding . In order to identify the proteins isolated by these assays , we performed a proteomic analysis of the bands obtained with D44 and N - P3 - [ D15 ] 2 . This analysis revealed that N - P3 - [ D15 ] 2 could co - precipitate SH3 containing proteins involved in endocytosis such as intersectin , amphiphysin and endophilin ( Figure 2D ) . Most of these proteins are known partners of dynamin , which indicates that the newly designed peptides preserve some specificity of the protein they are derived from . The three other SH3 - domain containing proteins isolated in this assay that do not fall in that category could either be hitherto unidentified interacting partners of dynamin , non - specific targets of the peptides or co - precipitates due to indirect interactions . For instance , SH3KBP1 / CIN85 is a known partner of endophilin involved in ligand induced receptor endocytosis ( Petrelli et al . , 2002 ) . Interestingly , many proteins known to be involved in CME , such as clathrin itself , subunits of the adaptor protein AP - 2 and Eps15R , but also actin and tubulin , were co - purified with this dimeric peptide . This observation is in accordance with the acknowledged complexity of the CME interactome as well as its interplay with the cytoskeleton ( Schmid and McMahon , 2007 ) . Unfortunately , the proteomics analysis of the D44 derived bands did not produce any conclusive results and needs to be performed again . However , considering the similarities between both band patterns , we can expect that this analysis will produce comparable results as with N - P3 - [ D15 ] 2 . We therefore went on to defining the apparent affinities of these peptides . Results 196 Figure 2 : Optimised peptides isolate CME related proteins from rat brain lysates ( A - C ) Silver stained gels comparing affinity isolation results from rat brain lysates using beads coated with ( A ) D15 or AL14 , ( B ) D15 or D44 and ( C ) N - P3 - [ D15 ] 2 and compared to control biotin coated beads . ( D ) Proteomics analysis of the bands obtained with N - P3 - [ D15 ] 2 from the affinity isolation performed in C . Enrichement ( red bars ) is obtained by comparing material isolated with the peptide vs . with biotinylated beads . Analysis of the results indicates that this peptide can isolate dynamin interaction partners ( green ) including amphiphysin as well as other SH3 domain containing proteins ( blue ) . Other proteins involved in CME were probably isolated as coprecipitates and demontrate the ability of the peptide to isolate proteins of the CME machinery from a cellular environment . C AGED P EPTIDES T O B LOCK E NDOCYTOSIS 197 Optimised peptides show a modest increase in affinity for isolated amph - SH3 domains Relative affinities of D44 , N - P2 - [ D15 ] 2 and N - P3 - [ D15 ] 2 as compared to D15 for isolated amph - SH3 domains were determined by surface plasmon resonance ( SPR ) ( Figure 3A - C ) . Curve fitting analysis enabled the determination of affinity constants for these three peptides and are reported in Table 1 . Notably , the K D of D15 for amph - SH3 was found in both trials to be close to 100 µM as previously described in the literature ( Jockusch et al . , 2005 ) . However , D44 only displayed a three - fold increased affinity for amph - SH3 so that it remained in the high micro - molar range . This result differs from the reported K D of this peptide sequence ( Solomaha et al . , 2005 ) . Similarly , dimeric peptides only displayed an apparent two to five - fold increase in affinity as compared to D15 . Considering that , by design , these peptide consist in a dimer of D15 , the increased apparent affinity may simply result from the doubling in concentration of that sequence on the SPR chip . Accordingly , the obtained K D for N - P2 - [ D15 ] 2 is not different from that of D15 and the affinity of C - P3 - [ D15 ] 2 for amph - SH3 as measured by SPR is , as for D44 , only two to three times that of D15 .

( D ) Curve fitting analysis of datapoints obtained by Fluorescence Polarisation during a direct titration assay using FITC - labelled peptides . Results 198 In order to avoid potential local concentration effects originating from the 2 - D display of peptides inherent to the SPR technique , we tried to determine the affinity constant of D44 by fluorescence polarisation ( FP ) ( Figure 3D ) . However , the obtained value was close to that measured by SPR ( Table 1 ) . Following our idea that these peptides may strongly bind to amphiphysin due to multimeric interactions , we conclude that our model using isolated amph - SH3 domains may not be suitable to explain the gain in affinity observed in affinity isolation assays .

In order to monitor the effect of the peptides on a cell’s endocytic activity , we set up an assay involving the detection of single CCVs with high temporal resolution together with cell dialysis though a patch pipette containing a blocker of interest . The principle of this assay is illustrated in Figure 4A and B . The endocytic activity of the cells was monitored using the pulsed - pH protocol ( ppH ) . It was designed in NIH - 3T3 cells to detect the formation of CCVs with a temporal resolution of ~ 2 s ( Merrifield et al . , 2005 ; Perrais and Merrifield , 2005 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . It relies on detecting the accessibility of a pH - sensitive cargo protein to the sequential applications of a mildly acidic extracellular solution . Cells are transfected with the transferrin receptor fused to the pH - sensitive super - ecliptic pHluorin ( TfR - SEP ) , a cargo known to be constitutively internalised by CME . Cells are then imaged by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( TIRFM ) every 2 s in synchrony with the alternative switching of the extracellular solution from pH 7 . 4 to pH 5 . 5 . When the cells are bathed in pH 7 . 4 solution , receptors at the cell surface are fluorescent . However , when in the presence of pH 5 . 5 solution , SEP molecules at the cell surface do not emit fluorescence , and receptors contained in newly formed CCVs that have not yet C AGED P EPTIDES T O B LOCK E NDOCYTOSIS 199 acidified become visible in isolation . Newly formed CCVs can thus be automatically detected by analysing the images taken at pH 5 . 5 ( see Methods ) , knowing that scission itself has occurred within the 2 s interval at pH 7 . 4 preceding their detection . Importantly , the endocytic activity of the cells can be followed quantitatively by monitoring the frequency of appearance of endocytic vesicles . It was reported that this frequency does not vary for at least 20 minutes in unperturbed cells ( Merrifield et al . , 2005 ; Lampe et al . , 2014 ; Shen et al . , 2014 ) . We verified that this was still the case in our recording conditions , where serum was omitted to allow for patch - clamp recordings ( Figure 4C , grey curve ) . We also assessed the quantitative nature of our assay by showing that bath application of Dyngo - 4a , a potent blocker of dynamin’s GTPase activity ( McCluskey et al . , 2013 ) , arrested the formation of CCVs within minutes ( Figure 4C , pink curve ) . Figure 4 : Simultaneous imaging and cell dialysis quantitatively monitors CCV formation in the presence or absence of endocytosis blockers ( A ) ( Left ) A cell patched with a thin glass pipette containing a blocker of interest seen in transmitted light ; ( Middle ) TIRFM image of the same cell expressing TfR - SEP taken at pH 7 . 4 ; ( Right ) TIRFM image taken 2 s later at pH 5 . 5 where non acidic intracellular organelles can be seen in isolation ( B ) Principle of the assay : The endocytic activity of the cell is being monitored for 15 minutes using the pulsed - pH protocol . For the first 5 minutes , the cell is left unperturbed ( cell attached configuration ) . Then , the blocker of interest is dialysed inside the cell for the remaining 10 minutes ( whole cell configuration ) . ( C ) Cumulated frequency of endocytic events detected with the ppH protocol in various conditions , normalised to basal endocytic activity ( black curve ) . Dialysing cells with a control intracellular solution containing no blocker induces a minimal rundown of endocytosis ( green curve , n = 60 ) as compared to unpatched cells ( grey curve , n = 12 ) . On the contrary , dialysis of 0 . 4 mM GTPγS ( purple curve , n = 2 ) or bath application of 50 µM Dyngo 4a ( pink curve , n = 4 ) induces an immediate and potent inhibition of CCV formation as detected by the ppH protocol . Cell dialysis with the optimised peptides was performed using the patch - clamp technique . A thin glass pipette , filled with the peptide of interest diluted in a solution containing the salts and nucleotides necessary for cell viability , is brought in Results 200 contact with the cell membrane ( Figure 4B ) . This pipette can be sealed onto the plasma membrane without perturbing the cell . In this so - called “cell - attached” configuration , we monitored the basal endocytic activity of NIH - 3T3 cells using the ppH protocol for 5 minutes . Then , the seal was broken so that the peptide containing solution was in direct contact with the cell interior and the peptide could be dialysed in . Again , we monitored the endocytic activity using the ppH protocol in this new “whole - cell” configuration . To asses that cell dialysis itself did not induce a rundown of endocytosis , we monitored the rate of CCV formation in the absence of any blocker . Endocytosis was minimally affected as compared to cells subjected to the ppH protocol alone ( Figure 4C , green curve ) . On the other hand , replacing GTP by its non - hydrolysable homolog GTPγS in the patch - pipette resulted in an almost total arrest of CCV formation within minutes ( Figure 4C , purple curve ) . We could therefore use this assay to compare the effect of the various D15 derived peptides on blocking endocytosis . High concentrations of D15 block endocytosis within minutes We first tested whether the peptides could reach the adherent cell membrane , where endocytosis would be monitored by TIRFM , within the time course of the assay . We tagged a D15 sequence with a red fluorophore ( Rhodamine - D15 ) and observed its kinetics of appearance in the TIRF field of view ( Figure 5A ) . In cell attached configuration , this membrane impermeable peptide cannot enter the cell . Accordingly , no fluorescence was observed during the first 3 minutes of recording . On the contrary , within one minute of whole cell configuration , red fluorescence could already be observed and had almost reached signal saturation by the end of the assay . We then tested whether our homemade peptides could be reliably used in cells by comparing the blocking efficiency of a homemade D15 sequence vs . a commercially available one . The rates of CCV formation as measured by our assay were strikingly similar using either D15 at 2 mM in the patch pipette ( Figure 5B , dotted and dashed lines ) . This demonstrates our synthesis and purification procedures are compatible with in cellulo experiments and that the assay can provide reproducible results . We then tested for the dose dependent effect of D15 on inhibiting CCV formation by using it at either 1 mM or 100 µM . We observed that there was a saturation effect such that while there was a clear increase in inhibition from 100 µM to 1 mM , there was no apparent difference when increasing the concentration of D15 further . Interestingly , this maximal effect of D15 equilibrated at an intermediate rate of CCV formation as compared to control and GTPγS treated cells , indicating only a partial inhibition of endocytosis ( Figure 5B , blue curves ) . We reasoned that dialysis of the peptides inside the cell may be rate limiting and that cumulative measures may be biased by such considerations . We thus measured the rate of CCV formation between 8 and 10 minutes of whole cell dialysis and compared it to the basal endocytic activity of the cell monitored in cell attached configuration . We found that used at 1 mM , D15 inhibited endocytosis to about 60 % as compared to basal conditions ( 61 . 8 ± 3 . 9 % , n = 22 ) . When used at 100 µM however , it only inhibited ~ 40 C AGED P EPTIDES T O B LOCK E NDOCYTOSIS 201 % of CCV formation ( 41 . 0 ± 5 . 0 % , n = 13 ) , slightly above the decrease observed without any peptide ( 32 . 7 ± 4 . 3 % , n = 60 ) ( Figure 5C ) .

The mutated D15 ( AL14 ) does not inhibit endocytosis The first optimisation strategy consisted in increasing the number of arginine residues in a sequence homologous to D15 in order to increase its affinity for the negatively charged SH3 domains of amphiphysin . Although AL14 lacked the ability to isolate amphiphysin from brain lysates in vitro , we decided to test its efficacy in our assay in living cells . Because our aim is to produce a photoactivatable blocker of endocytosis that can be used at smaller concentrations than D15 , we tested its efficacy at 100 µM in the patch pipette . However , in those conditions , AL14 failed in exhibiting any inhibitory activity on endocytosis ( Figure 6 ) . Results 202 Figure 6 : AL14 does not affect endocytosis in living cells Cumulated frequency of endocytic events detected with the ppH protocol in cells dialysed with 100 µM AL14 . Black and green curves represent basal endocytic activity and control rundown respectively as in Figure 4 . Purple curve : AL14 , 100 µM ( n = 4 ) Elongated and dimerised peptides potently inhibit endocytosis We tested the efficacy of two elongated and two dimeric peptides in cells , namely the D44 , N - D30 , C - P3 - [ D15 ] 2 and N - P3 - [ D15 ] 2 , used at 100 µM in the patch - pipette . Even at this lower concentration , D44 appeared to be almost as efficient in inhibiting CCV formation as D15 used 10 times more concentrated . When quantifying its inhibitory efficiency by measuring the rate of CCV formation in the last 2 minutes of the recording to take the time of cell dialysis into account , it had blocked endocytosis to the same extent as D15 used at 1 mM ( 58 . 6 ± 9 . 6 % inhibition , Figure 7A and 7C , bright red ) . To test whether this effect was saturable , we used D44 at 1 mM in the patch pipette . In these conditions , endocytosis was potently inhibited and the rate of CCV formation had dropped to almost 20 % of its basal value ( 79 . 4 ± 5 . 2 % inhibition , Figure 7A and 7C , dark red ) . D44 is therefore more potent in inhibiting endocytosis than D15 . Finally , 100µM of the N - D30 elongated peptide or either of the dimeric peptides were enough to block endocytosis to more than 50 % of its basal rate ( Figure 7A and 7C , N - D30 : 54 . 3 ± 6 . 2 % inhibition , pink ; Figure 7B and 7C , N - P3 - [ D15 ] 2 : 50 . 7 ± 5 . 2 % inhibition , orange ; C - P3 - [ D15 ] 2 : 53 . 5 ± 8 . 8 % inhibition , yellow ) . It cannot be excluded that the modest increase in inhibition observed with the dimeric peptides as compared to monomeric D15 may be due to an apparent concentration of monomers of 200 µM rather than the effect of a putative increase in its avidity for amphiphysin . However , the results obtained with D44 and even its truncation N - D30 support our hypothesis that increasing the number of local SH3 - interaction motifs greatly enhances the efficiency of the peptides in interfering with dynamin . C AGED P EPTIDES T O B LOCK E NDOCYTOSIS 203 Further characterisation and optimisation of the dimeric peptides will therefore be needed to distinguish whether the dimerisation strategy could enable us to mimic the efficiency of the D44 sequence . It could also be interesting to investigate whether any additional affinity could be gained by testing the C - D25 truncation to explore the contribution in binding to amphiphysin of the amino - acids lying at the C - terminus end of dyn - PRD . Figure 7 : Two optimisation strategies increase the blocking efficiency of dyn - PRD derived peptides A and B Black , green and blue curves represent basal endocytic activity , control rundown and effect of D15 1 mM respectively as in Figure 4 .

( C ) After 8 min of cell dialysis , 1 mM D44 inhibits CCV formation by ~ 80 % as compared to basal conditions , almost reaching the efficiency of GTPγS ( 88 . 9 ± 7 . 1 % ) . 100 µM of either the elongated or the dimeric peptides inhibit 50 % - 60 % of forming CCVs , demonstrating the efficiency of both optimisation strategies . Results 204 Combining the monitoring assay with photoactivation As a first step before making one of the peptides tested so far photoactivatable , we set up a photoactivation paradigm to be used in combination with our monitoring assay . To this aim , we used a caged GTPγS compound on which a non - hydrolysable thiol functional group is shielded by a UV - labile cage ( DMNPE - GTPγS ) ( Figure 8A ) . We aligned the tip of a 200 µm optical fiber with the tip of the perfusion pipette responsible for the local switch in extracellular solution used to perform the ppH protocol . Cells were monitored with the ppH protocol and dialysed with an intracellular solution containing 4 mM DMNPE - GTPγS . A 500 ms pulse of 365 nm light performed 5 minutes after the start of cell dialysis resulted in a noticeable reduction in the rate of CCV formation ( Figure 8B , pink curve ) . A 1 s pulse of UV light even more robustly induced an arrest of CCV formation ( Figure 8B , purple curve ) . Furthermore , after only 500 ms of illumination , endocytosis seemed to resume after a few minutes whereas the blockade appeared to be longer lasting when the cells were illuminated for 1 s . These results support our primary aim to use photoactivation as a tool to probe for the temporal requirement of dynamin at CCPs without waiting for a state of equilibrium limited by cell dialysis .

Discussion C AGED P EPTIDES T O B LOCK E NDOCYTOSIS 205 The goal of the study which developments are presented here , is to produce a photoactivatable blocker of endocytosis to investigate on the contribution of the dynamin - amphiphysin interaction in regulating CME . To this aim , we have produced and characterised in vitro and in vivo a series of peptides derived from the PRD of dynamin . We found , in agreement with other studies ( Jockusch et al . , 2005 ) that the commonly used D15 sequence has a rather low affinity for the isolated SH3 domain of amphiphysin ( K D in the range of 100 µM ) . For that reason , D15 has to be used in vivo at high concentrations and only partially inhibits CCV formation within 10 minutes of cell dialysis as quantified by our assay . We therefore designed a peptide library in which we either mutated elongated or dimerised the D15 peptide sequence . Our results indicate that both the elongation and dimerisation strategies were efficient in increasing the avidity of those peptides for amphiphysin and that the elongation strategy greatly enhanced the endocytosis blocking efficiency in living cells as compared to the D15 sequence . The mutation strategy failed in optimising the D15 sequence We cannot explain as of yet the reason why AL14 did not at least display the same endocytic activity as D15 considering that it harbours a similar double overlapping Class II interaction motif forming the PXRPXR motif responsible for its specificity towards amphiphysin binding ( Grabs et al . , 1997 ) . Perhaps the overall charge of the peptide , increased by the number of arginine residues , makes it difficult to dialyse inside the cytoplasm so that it never reaches the adherent surface of the cell where our measurements are performed . Similar difficulties had been observed when trying to dialyse cells with arginine - rich TAT tagged peptides ( personal communication ) . Elongated peptides have an increased avidity for amphiphysin 1 The first peptide tested for the elongation strategy D44 is derived from a 44 amino - acid long stretch of dyn - PRD containing the D15 sequence . Surprisingly , it only exhibited a two to three - fold greater affinity for the isolated amph - SH3 domain than D15 as measured by SPR and FP . Although it cannot account for our in cellulo results alone , this measurable increase may be due to the contribution of extra positive charges on the D44 sequence . It has indeed been reported that the two arginines of the PSRPNR motif of D15 were responsible for the specificity of the binding to amph - SH3 ( Grabs et al . , 1997 ) . This was later proposed to be due to the presence of an unusual negatively charged surface revealed in the crystal structure of amph - SH3 but not in the SH3 domains of other proteins ( Owen et al . , 1998 ) . Hypothetically , the presence of an extra positive charge 3 amino - acids down from the D15 sequence in the C - terminal direction ( see Figure 1 ) may increase the affinity of the interaction with amphiphysin . Results 206 Although we have not tested for this hypothesis yet , we could study the contribution of the C terminal amino - acids by characterising the C - D25 truncation of our library ( Figure 1 ) . Being able to use C - D25 instead of D44 while maintaining the same blocking efficiency in cells would be advantageous in terms of caging possibilities ( see below ) but also simply in terms of synthesis workload . Not only are longer peptides more difficult to produce due to the increased occurrence of undesired truncation products , the sequence of D44 is particularly tricky to synthesise . It is indeed quite rich in hydrophobic amino - acids such as alanine and valine , but also in arginines , an amino - acid requiring a bulky side chain protection group . Accordingly , we had to introduce a lot of double coupling steps in the synthesis strategy as appropriate in such conditions ( Grillo - Bosch et al . , 2011 ) , making the synthesis of D44 quite tedious ( see materials and methods for details ) . Nevertheless , the very modest increase in affinity of D44 over D15 observed by our SPR experiments neither compared with the robust band pattern obtained by affinity - based isolation assays nor with its efficiency in inhibiting CCV formation in living cells . This observation suggests that affinity alone cannot explain the totality of our results . In our in cellulo assay , D44 could be used at a 10 times lower concentration than D15 while still resulting in the same inhibition . Such an improvement should translate in an affinity constant in the lower micro - molar range if not less . Such a low K D of D44 had been reported in ( Solomaha et al . , 2005 ) as measured by SPR . The discrepancy between their measurement and ours may result from the fact that we used amph - SH3 domains fused to SUMO while they used GST fusions . GST , though commonly used in such assays , is known to homo - dimerise ( Fabrini et al . , 2009 ) . Considering the presence of several SH3 interaction motifs present in the D44 sequence , it is possible that the apparent affinity of D44 for artificially dimerised targets would be much greater than for isolated ones . In order to test for this hypothesis , we are currently trying to determine the K D of D44 against GST - Amph - SH3 domains or full length amphiphysin . Consistent with the possibility that D44 potently interferes with the endocytic machinery in living cells via avidity effects , we found that the 100 µM of its N - D30 truncation inhibited CCV formation to almost the same extent as 100 µM D44 . This result hints to the possibility that the Class II consensus domain lying N - terminally of D15 may be key to the observed inhibitory activity of D44 . This result is in agreement with reported in vitro affinity assays showing that truncating dyn - PRD from its C - terminal side does not affect the binding to GST - amph - SH3 until reaching the PSRPNR motif ( Grabs et al . , 1997 ) . Multimeric interactions may be important for dynamin ' s action in living cells The dimerisation strategy was undertaken following the idea that both amphiphysin and dynamin form homo - dimers as their basic unit of interaction . Dynamin does so via its stalk domains ( Faelber et al . , 2012 ) while amphiphysin does so via its BAR C AGED P EPTIDES T O B LOCK E NDOCYTOSIS 207 domains ( Peter , 2004 ) . In a cellular environment , whether two amph - SH3 domains are optimally placed on an amphiphysin dimer to face two dyn - PRDs on a dynamin dimer is unknown . Indeed , the crystal structures of both the BAR and the SH3 domains of amphiphysin have been reported but they were solved separately ( Peter , 2004 ; Owen et al . , 1998 ) . The precise localisation of amph - SH3 domains with regards to the BAR dimer thus remains elusive . Moreover , the crystal structure of dynamin was solved in different conformations but always without its unstructured PRD ( Chappie et al . , 2010 , 2011 ; Faelber et al . , 2012 ; Sundborger et al . , 2014 ) . It is therefore difficult to predict where the residues composing the D15 sequence would be found in a dynamin dimer , even less so in a fully oligomerised dynamin ring . As illustrated in Figure 1 , two putative spatial arrangements of amphiphysin SH3 domains may confer it an increased avidity for dynamin . First , in a closed configuration , two SH3 domains could sit at each end of a BAR dimer , around 10 nm appart , and inhibit membrane binding until the arrival of dynamin , as has been proposed for syndapin 1 ( Rao et al . , 2010 ) . Second , in an open conformation , SH3 domains could be found on the edges of two different BAR dimers to be in direct contact , as has been proposed for endophilin ( Mim et al . , 2012 ) . This configuration would only be possible once the neck of the vesicle is tight enough for a scaffold to form around it , therefore providing an interesting explanation for the timely burst of dynamin recruitment observed right before scission . As was observed for D44 , the discrepancy between our various in vitro assays using dimeric peptides may support such a hypothesis in which multimeric interactions between dynamin and amphiphysin are at play . Our failure to measure a sizeably increased affinity of dimeric peptides for amph - SH3 over D15 ( N - P3 - [ D15 ] 2 : K D = 22 . 8 ± 1 . 8 , N - P2 - [ D15 ] 2 : K D = 43 . 3 ± 1 . 6 ) while observing a clear enrichment in CME related proteins by affinity isolation and proteomics analysis could indeed be explained by the possibility that endogenous amphiphysin forms dimers when interacting with the endocytic machinery . The dimeric nature of the peptides may therefore participate in the strong binding to endogenous amphiphysin by avidity effects in a cellular environment , a configuration that cannot be mimicked using isolated SH3 domains . Whether dimeric peptides have an increased efficiency over D15 in inhibiting endocytosis in living cells is still difficult to assess using our current data . A few limitations about the assay may be taken into account when considering this issue . First , the fact that the N - P3 - [ D15 ] 2 and C - P3 - [ D15 ] 2 dimeric peptides had similar efficiencies in cellulo regardless of their orientation may suggest that a linker consisting of 6 peg motifs is long enough for the D15 monomers to tumble in a variety of orientations . This may raise the possibility of further optimising the avidity of such peptides by finding a linker length where each monomer would fit the distance between two endogenous amph - SH3 domains . Following this idea , we are currently testing by affinity isolation and western blotting the dimeric peptide library . Preliminary results seem to show that peptides with shorter linkers appear to bind amphiphysin 1 better than longer ones ( data not shown ) . Results 208 Second , we observed that in some instances ( 10 . 2 % of all cells considered in this study ) , the endocytic activity of a cell remained apparently unperturbed despite being dialysed with a blocker . These " failures " could occur with any of the peptides used but would affect the average measure of datasets of smaller size more than that of large ones . Undoubtedly , no objective criterion would justify a priori the removal of these data points . For the sake of the discussion , it can however be interesting to note , that when removed a posteriori for an apparent lack of response , the inhibitory activity of C - P3 - d [ D15 ] 2 rises from 53 . 5 ± 8 . 8 % to 65 . 7 ± 4 . 7 % ( + 12 . 2 % ) , equalling the efficiency of D15 used at 1 mM , for which the apparent blocking efficiency remained almost unchanged by the removal of " failures " ( + 3 . 4 % inhibition ) . If seen as such , similarly to D44 , dimeric peptides could potentially be used ten times less concentrated than D15 while exhibiting a similar inhibitory activity ( Figure 9 ) . Figure 9 : Removing cells with " failed " dialysis from the dataset reveals the efficiency of the optimised peptides Same Legend as in Figure 7 but using a dataset that excludes failures . In both ( A ) and ( B ) , blue curve : D15 , 1 mM ( n = 20 instead of 22 ) ; Changes in ( A ) , bright red curve : D44 , 100 µM ( n = 5 instead of 6 ) ; Changes in ( B ) , orange curve : N - P3 - [ D15 ] 2 , 100 µM ( n = 8 instead of 11 ) and yellow curve : C - P3 - [ D15 ] 2 , 100 µM ( n = 6 instead of 8 ) . C The quantification of the inhibitory activity of peptides is only illustrated here for the peptides that contained failures in their datasets . The grey dashed line recalls the values that were obtained using the full dataset ( presented in Figure 7C ) . Third , even though we do not know the reason for those “failures” , it should be noted that it may ( or may not ) be linked to the quality of the intracellular solution used . Indeed , several compositions of intracellular solution have been used throughout this study ( see Materials and Methods for details ) and all of them did not exhibit the same stability on average . Should it be a coincidence or not , no “failures” were observed after the intracellular solution had been supplemented with ascorbate , a potent anti - oxidant . We tried to compare as many peptides as possible in these optimal conditions C AGED P EPTIDES T O B LOCK E NDOCYTOSIS 209 and confirmed the efficiency of the elongation strategy ( Figure 10 ) . We however have not yet tested the dimeric peptides under these conditions making a direct comparison of the results difficult . Figure 10 : Probing the efficiency of peptides in an optimised intracellular solution Same Legend as in Figure 7A and C but using a dataset that excludes cells recorded in the absence of ascorbate in the intracellular solution . D15 100 µM ( light blue ) and N - D30 100 µM ( pink ) datasets are the same as already presented in Figure 5 and Figure 7 respectively ; D15 1 mM ( blue , n = 6 instead of 22 ) ; D44 1 mM ( red , n = 10 instead of 15 ) . Finally , it should be noted that our peptide libraries were derived from the PRD sequence of dynamin 1 . Dynamin 1 and amphiphysin 1 are brain enriched isoforms while dynamin 2 and amphiphysin 2 are predominantly found in other tissues . Accordingly , the inhibitory activity of D15 has been widely reported in neurons ( Hosoi et al . , 2009 ; Jockusch et al . , 2005 ; Kittler et al . , 2000 ; Lüscher et al . , 1999 ; Shupliakov , 1997 ; Wu et al . , 2009 ) . To our knowledge , D15 had never been used in another cell type . Dynamin 2 also displays an overlapping PXRPXR SH3 binding motif but in vitro determination of its affinity for amphiphysin was performed using amphiphysin 1 SH3 domains ( Solomaha et al . , 2005 ) . Although NIH - 3T3 cells express both dynamin isoforms ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) like many commonly used cell lines ( Liu et al . , 2008 ) , we cannot exclude that the dynamin 1 derived D15 would be less efficient in amphiphysin 2 expressing fibroblasts than it is in neurons . Also , it is possible that CME in fibroblasts is less dependent on the dynamin - amphiphysin interaction than neuronal CME is . Moreover , our efforts to optimise the blocking efficiency of D15 - derived peptides may be hindered by this consideration . Indeed , in this region , the sequence of dynamin 1 is quite shorter than that of dynamin 2 ( e . g . D44 would translate into a Dyn2 - derived 63 - mer peptide ) . Therefore , the Class II interaction motif of its N - D30 truncation , potentially confering it avidity for amph - SH3 , and the extra arginine found in its C - D25 truncation , Results 210 potentially increasing its affinity , would both be found further away from the original D15 motif . The increased distance of these binding sites may reduce the efficiency of the multimeric interactions probably at play when using our elongated peptides . Caging possibilities Obviously , further characterisation of both libraries of peptides used in this study will have to be performed in order to select the best candidate for photoactivation . We propose to render the final optimised peptide photoactivatable by caging its interaction site with amphiphysin . Several caging strategies can be envisaged to this end and the feasibility of these strategies should be taken into account when deciding which blocker will be used . Considering the importance of the two arginine residues contained in the D15 sequence , the PSRPNR motif will be our site of focus when synthesising the caged peptides . Unfortunately , caging of the functional group of one of these residues doesn ' t seem conceivable . Indeed , prolines ( which drive the affinity for SH3 domains ) have no reactive side chain to easily incorporate a cage on , and arginines ( which drive the specificity for amphiphysin ) appear to be quite difficult to cage or use . Indeed , to our knowledge , caged arginines have only been reported once and the strategy has not been reused since ( Wood et al . , 1998 ) . We will thus consider other approaches . First , we could shield the positive charges by linking negatively charged glutamates or phosphates to the sequence via a cleavable linker ( electrostatic caging ) . This strategy has already been validated for the local delivery of protease - sensitive molecules to tumors ( Jiang et al . , 2004 ) . Second , we could prevent the interaction by mere steric hindrance by caging the peptide backbone . Finally , the serine residue could potentially be caged , but with no guarantee that it would have as strong an impact as caging a proline or an arginine would certainly have had . As already mentioned , these strategies rely on caging key properties of the D15 sequence in conferring it its specificity for amphiphysin as reported in the literature . However , we have not yet elucidated the reason for D44’s efficiency as compared to D15 . Therefore , focusing our caging strategy on the PSRPNR stretch alone may not be enough to cage such a long compound . If the C - D25 peptide could be used and our hypothesis that an additional arginine lying N - terminally of the D15 sequence is important for its interaction with amphiphysin , electrostatic caging may be efficient on this truncation . On N - D30 and D44 however , both strategies may prove insufficient . On the other hand , caging strategies that would be efficient on the D15 sequence should all prove as efficient on its dimeric version . With this in mind , we have already synthesised a glutamate - shielded monomeric D15 peptide ( E6 - D15 ) but have no biophysical or in cellulo data using it yet . However , since two caging groups will be present per molecule in the dimeric versions , we will have to check that the yields of photoactivation do not drop and prevent an efficient block of endocytosis . C AGED P EPTIDES T O B LOCK E NDOCYTOSIS 211 Temporal vs . spatial control As presented in the introduction , the development of a dyn - PRD derived photoactivatable blocker of endocytosis may provide interesting information on the temporal requirements for dynamin at CCPs . However , we can start getting a glimpse on this issue using uncaged peptides by using our assay as it is . We could indeed observe in dynamin - mCherry transfected cells whether dynamin is recruited at CCPs in cells dialysed with D15 or one of its more potent variants . We predict that if dynamin indeed requires amphiphysin to be recruited to CCPs , the presence of a peptide may prevent its presence at CCPs by sequestering amphiphysin in the cytosol . On the other hand , if dynamin is recruited by an earlier event , it may accumulate at arrested CCPs , waiting for the arrival of amphiphysin to switch from a regulatory to a catalytic activity directly coupled to scission ( Ferguson and De Camilli , 2012 ; Mettlen et al . , 2009 ; Roux , 2014 ) . Once obtained , it will be interesting to compare the timecourse of action of the dynamin derived photoactivatable blocker with that of DMNPE - GTPγS . Indeed , GTPγS affects the GTPase activity of dynamin whereas D15 based blockers most probably interfere with its recruitment . As we have shown , uncaging of GTPγS instantly modulates the rate of CCV formation , given the 4 s temporal resolution of our detection assay . Interestingly , because we can use a 1 s pulse of UV light to obtain this effect , we could use photoactivation to test for the speed of this effect below the 4 s resolution imposed by the ppH protocol . Indeed , the pulse of UV light could be applied as we have done so far 1 s before but also 100 ms before , 100 ms after or 1 s after the image taken at pH 7 . 4 during which a CCV detected at pH 5 . 5 has been formed . For example , if more than 2 s are required for GTPγS to dislodge a GTP molecule from dynamin and start exhibiting any effect , we may be able to visualise it by comparing the change of slope obtained by uncaging before an image taken at pH 7 . 4 with that obtained by uncaging afterwards . Moreover , we can speculate that there will probably be a much more significant delay between photoactivation and effect of the dynamin derived peptides . This delay will provide information on how long forming CCPs can proceed normally before requiring dynamin . This delay could also be compared with that obtained using photoactivatable peptides interfering with interactions involving AP - 2 ( Nevola et al . , 2013 ) which is present at CCPs throughout their entire lifetime . Finally , obtaining a specific blocker of endocytosis can not only provide temporal information on the function of dynamin but also prove useful to study spatial aspects of CME . In the assay described in this study , UV illumination was applied over the entire cell . However , it could be conceivable to uncage locally using laser illumination . This could open the way to studying in detail the involvement of CME at the leading edge of migrating cells or specifically at focal adhesion points for example . Also , considering the complex morphology of neurons , being able to inhibit CME in a spatially restricted area could help unravel unknown mechanisms regulating neurotransmission . Results 212 In conclusion , we expect that the development of a photoactivatable blocker of dynamin dependent endocytosis will prove useful for a variety of applications focusing on the spatio - temporal dynamics of endocytosis .

C AGED P EPTIDES T O B LOCK E NDOCYTOSIS 213 Procedure : Monomeric peptides were synthesised at 0 . 05 mmol scale on Fmoc - NOVA PEG rink amide AM LL resin . Dimerc peptides on PAL NovaSyn TG resin ( Novabiochem ) . Amino - acids were assembled by automated SPPS on a CEM micro - waves Liberty - 1 synthesiser ( Saclay , France ) except for C - terminally linked dimeric peptides . Coupling of PEG motifs and N - terminal derivatisations were also performed manually . For manual synthesis , Fmoc protecting groups were cleaved with 4 - methylpiperidine in DMF ( 1 : 5 v / v , 1x1 min + 2x7 min ) except for the final coupling of PEG motifs on N - terminally linked dimeric ligands for which the deprotection was performed using 4 - methylpiperidine in NMP ( 1 : 5 v / v , 1x1min + 4x5min ) . Couplings of Fmoc - protected amino acid were carried out in the presence of HBTU / HOBt and DIPEA ( 5 : 5 : 10 eq , for 1h30 min ) . C - terminally linked dimeric ligands were obtained by generating two points of chain elongation with a Fmoc - Lys ( Fmoc ) - OH amino acid , whereas N - terminally linked dimeric ligands were obtained by coupling a 7 : 3 mixture of Fmoc - Lys ( n3 ) - OH and pentynoic acid followed by copper ( I ) - catalyzed azide - alkyne cycloaddition in DMF / 4 - methylpiperidine ( 8 : 2 ) with CuI ( 5 eq ) , ascorbic acid ( 10 eq ) and aminogunanidine ( 10 eq ) . For automated synthesis , Fmoc protecting groups were cleaved with 4 - methylpiperidine in DMF ( 1 : 5 v / v ) containing 0 . 1M HOBt using a combination of short ( 35 W , 75°C , 30s ) and a long cycle ( 35 W , 70°C , 180s ) . Couplings of Fmoc - protected amino acid ( 0 . 2 M ) were carried out in the presence of HBTU ( 0 . 25 M ) and DIPEA ( 1M ) using standard coupling cycles ( 20 W , 70°C , 300s , except for Fmoc - Arg ( Pbf ) - OH ( 0 W , RT , 1500s followed by 20 W , 70°C , 300s ) . The synthesis of D44 required a non - standard procedure inspired from ( Grillo - Bosch et al . , 2011 ) . We evaluated a priori the most difficult couplings and introduced a systematic double coupling on Y1 , A2 , L3 , G5 ( N - terminus amino acids ) V37 , P38 , I40 and T41 ( bulky amino acids ) . Other double couplings were then introduced empirically in the following positions : P7 , S11 , S16 , P22 , P23 , A33 , P34 , G36 , D43 and P44 . An acetylation step was systematically introduced after each amino acid coupling in order to eliminate truncation products . N - free peptide resins where derivatised with Acetyl groups , biotin or fluorophores for the various applications . Acetylated peptides were used in living cells and for SPR experiments . Biotinylated peptides were used for affinity isolation from rat brain lysates and SPR experiments . Fluorophore - coupled peptides were used for fluorescence polarisation assays . Acetylation was performed using 7 mL of a solution of 0 . 15M acetic anhydride and 0 . 15M pyridine in DMF for 1h30 min . Biotinylation was performed by first coupling Fmoc - TTDS - OH ( 3 eq ) then biotin ( 3 eq ) . Both couplings were mediated by HBTU / HOBt and DIPEA ( 3 : 3 : 6 eq , for 1h30 min ) . FITC ( 2 eq ) was dissolved in a minimal amount of pyridine / DMF / DCM 12 : 7 : 5 ( v / v / v ) , added to the resin and left to react overnight with mild orbital shaking . Texas red ( 2 . 5 mg , 1 . 1 eq ) was dissolved in 750 µL anhydrous DMF and added to the resin under Argon in the abscence of light for 10 minutes . 3 3µL of DIPEA were then added and left to react for another 30 min . Rhodamin - D15 was obtained by derivatising the N - free peptide with Fmoc - Ahx - OH followed by addition of ROX - Osu ( 1 . 2 eq ) in DMF in the presence of DIPEA ( 1h ) . Peptides were cleaved from the resin for 3 h using TFA / H 2 O / TIPS ( 95 : 2 . 5 : 2 . 5 ) with mild orbital shaking and Results 214 precipitated with cold diethyl ether . Crude peptides were resuspended in H 2 O containing a few drops of DMF and purified in a Waters 1525 semi - preparative RP - HPLC system equipped with a UV / Vis detector and a YMC C18 , ODS - A 5 / 120 , 250 × 20 mm . Purification was performed using a standard gradient of 5 % MeCN containing 0 . 1 % TFA for 5 min followed by an appropriate gradient of MeCN containing 0 . 1 % TFA in H 2 O for 40 min ( 1 mL . min - 1 ) . UV detection was performed at 220 and 280 nm . All peptides were obtained at more than 90 % purity as judged by analytical RP - HPLC with the exception of N - P3 - [ D15 ] 2 ( 84 . 8 % purity ) . Masses were determined by MALDI - TOF spectroscopy in an UltraFlex III TOF - TOF ( Bruker Daltonics ) . Peptide concentrations were determined by absorbance measurements at 280 nm in a UV - visible spectrophotometer ( UV - 1800 , Shimadzu ) ( ε ( Y ) = 1490 M - 1 . cm - 1 ) . Peptides were lyophilised and stored at - 80°C until use . The commercially available D15 was obtained from Tocris Biosciences ( Bristol , UK ) . Plasmid construction SUMO - Amph1 - SH3 was generated by subcloning murine Ampiphysin1 SH3 domain ( residues 607 - 686 ) from pAmph1 - mCherry ( gift from C . Merrifield ) using BamHI and XhoI restriction sites into a modified pET - SUMO bacterial expression vector ( Life Technologies ) incorporating a TEV cleavage site and a multiple cloning site following the SUMO tag . Protein production The recombinant SH3 domain was produced in BL21 - CodonPlus ( DE3 ) - RIPL E coli cells by autoinduction at 16 °C and purified as previously described by affinity ( Ni - NTA resin ) and size exclusion chromatographies as previously described ( Sainlos et al . , 2011 ) . The protein was stored at - 80 °C in the fluorescence polarisation and surface plasmon resonance experimental buffer ( 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer , pH 7 . 4 at 21 °C , sodium chloride 150 mM and 0 . 01 % Tween - 20 ) until use . Affinity isolation assays Frozen adult Sprague - Dawley rat brains ( 2 x ~ 1 . 5 g ) were thawed in 20 mL ice cold modified RIPA buffer ( 50 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % SDS , 0 . 5 % sodium deoxycholate , 1 % NP - 40 , 1 mM EDTA ) containing a protease inhibitor mixture ( 1 : 1 , 000 ; Protease Inhibitor Cocktail set III ; Calbiochem ) for about 5 min and cut into small pieces . The tissues were homogenised using a glass / teflon homogeniser . Homogenates were centrifuged at 7 , 500 g for 25 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris . The supernatant was aliquoted and stored at - 80 °C until the affinity - based isolation ( pull - down ) experiments were performed . C AGED P EPTIDES T O B LOCK E NDOCYTOSIS 215 Streptavidin - coated beads ( Dynabeads M - 280 , Life Technologies ) were washed three times and incubated for 15 min at room temperature ( RT ) in modified RIPA buffer supplemented with 0 . 1 % BSA . Rat brain lysates were incubated with biotinylated ligands for 10 min at RT before addition of the beads and further incubation for 5 min at RT . Beads were washed 5 times in RIPA buffer and transferred into new eppendorf tubes . For elution , acetylated ligands were added in excess to the bead suspension and incubated for 5 min at RT . The supernatant was kept for proteomics analysis and electrophoresis followed by silver staining after addition of fresh 6x sample buffer ( ProteoSilver Silver Stain Kit , Sigma - Aldrich ) . Proteomics analysis The proteomic analysis was conducted by the CGFB Proteome core facility . Proteins exhibiting a two - fold increase enrichment as compared to biotin control only were considered for further analysis . Obtained data were compared to the rattus norvegicus proteome . Surface plasmon resonance SPR experiments were performed at 25 °C with a Biacore™ X100 apparatus ( Biacore™ , GE Healthcare Life Sciences , Uppsala , Sweden ) . The experiments were performed on biotin CAPture kit sensor chips ( Biacore™ ) . 50 - 90 RU of biotinylated peptides were immobilised by injecting solutions prepared at 5 - 10 nM in the running buffer used for the binding experiments ( 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer , pH 7 . 4 at 21 °C , sodium chloride 150 mM and 0 . 01 % Tween - 20 ) . One flow - cell was left blank and used as a reference . For the single cycle kinetics experiments , the captured target and analyte samples were prepared in the running buffer and injected at 5 and 30 μl / min respectively . The capture of streptavidin and regeneration of the functionalised surface was achieved following the manufacturer recommended protocols . The sensorgrams were double - referenced using Biacore X100 Evaluation software ( Biacore™ ) . No points were removed prior to data fitting . Spikes still present after the double - referencing process had no influence on the analysis . The fast association and dissociation rate constants prevented reliable kinetic analysis . The curves were thus exploited using equilibrium analysis to obtain the dissociation equilibrium constants in GraphPad Prism ( GraphPad Software v5 . 03 for Windows ) by fitting the data with the one - site binding hyperbola formula where Y is the response ( in RU ) , B max is the maximal binding , K D is the affinity constant to be determined and X is the protein concentration . Results 216 Fluorescence polarisation Fluorescence Polarisation assays where performed at 25°C in 96 - well half area polystyrene NBS black plates using a Polarstar Omega microplate reader ( BMG labtech ) . Samples were excited at 485 ± 5 nm and Emited polarised fluorescence was measured at 520 ± 5 nm . Target mP value was set to 50 mP according to the manufacturer ' s recommendations . Stocks of SUMO - amph - SH3 were serially diluted in 10 mM phosphate buffer , NaCl 150mM , pH 7 . 4 containing 0 . 05 % tween - 20 in low binding 1 . 5 mL tubes . Samples were slightly vortexed after dilution . FITC - labelled peptides were then added to 10 nM final concentration . Samples were also slightly vortexed after peptide addition . Obtained curves were fitted using one - site binding formula from GraphPad Prism described above . Fluorescence imaging Imaging was performed at 34 - 37°C on an Olympus microscope ( Olympus IX71 ) equipped with an inverted Apochromat 60x oil objective of numerical aperture 1 . 49 in combination with a 1 . 6x magnifying lens ; or with a 100x objective of numerical aperture 1 . 49 ( Olympus ) . SEP transfected samples were excited in TIRF illumination with a 473 nm laser source ( Cobolt ) . Rhodamine - D15 was excited by a coaligned 561 nm laser when applicable . Emitted fluorescence was filtered using 525 / 50 m for SEP and 620 / 60 m for Rhodamin filters ( Chroma Technology Corp . ) . Simultaneous dual color imaging was achieved using a DualView beam splitter ( Roper Scientific ) . Images were acquired by an electron multiplying charge coupled device camera ( EMCCD QuantEM : 512SC , Roper Scientific ) controlled by the software MetaVue 7 . 1 ( Molecular Devices ) . Fast solution exchange was controlled by electrovalves ( Lee company ) connected to a theta glass pipette ( ∼ 100 - µ m tip size achieved using a vertical Narishige puller ; World Precision Instruments ) placed above the recorded cell . Cells were thus alternatively perfused with Hepes or MES buffered saline solutions ( HBS / MBS ) containing ( in mM ) : 135 NaCl , 5 KCl , 0 . 4 MgCl 2 , 1 . 8 CaCl 2 , 1 D - glucose and 20 Hepes or MES . pH was adjusted to 7 . 4 or 5 . 5 using NaOH and osmolarity to 310 – 315 mOsmol / l . Uncaging of DMNPE - GTPγS ( custom order to Jena Bioscience , Germany ) was achieved using a 365 nm LED light source coupled to an optical fiber ( 200 µm diameter ) which tip was aligned with the tip of the theta glass pipette responsible for fast solution exchange . Cell dialysis and patch - clamp recordings Cells were patched with pipettes made of borosilicate glass ( GC150F , Harvard Apparatus ) and pulled with a vertical Narishige puller ( World Precision Instruments ) . The composition of the solution contained in the patch pipette changed in the course of this study with the aim of obtaining always more stable control recordings . All solutions tested contained at least ( in mM ) : 130 - 140 KCH 3 SO 3 , 1 EGTA , 0 . 1 CaCl 2 , 10 - 20 Hepes , 4 ATP ( sodium or magnesium salt ) , 0 . 4 Na x GTP ( except when stated otherwise ) and 5 C AGED P EPTIDES T O B LOCK E NDOCYTOSIS 217 phosphocreatine . pH was adjusted to 7 . 2 using KOH and osmolarity to ~ 300 mOsm / L . Chloride ions either came from 2 mM KCl , 10 mM NaCl or 4 mM MgCl 2 in various trials . 3 mM Na - Ascorbate were added to the intracellular solution about half - way through the project . All salts were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich . Cells were voltage - clamped at - 60 mV with an EPC - 10 amplifier ( Heka ) with series resistance and cell capacitance estimation every 4 s . The digital triggers of the amplifier were also used to drive the electrovalves for pH changes and the UV illumination . Cell viability and dialysis efficiency were made sure of by monitoring three parameters throughout the recording using the Pulse software : pipette capacitance should remain approximately stable , series resistance should remain below 10 MΩ and leak current should remain above - 100 pA . If either of these criteria was not respected , the recording was not considered for analysis . Image analysis and data representation The detection , tracking , and quantification of endocytic events was performed using scripts developed previously in Matlab 7 . 4 ( Mathworks ; ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) ) . Importantly , this method of detection had been characterised as missing ∼ 30 % of all events but with a low percentage of false positives ( ∼ 20 % ) ( Shen et al . , 2014 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) , making it ideal for comparative studies over large datasets . Briefly , images were segmented using multidimensional image analysis ( MIA ; developed for Metamorph [ Ropert Scientific ] by J . B . Sibarita , Interdisciplinary Institute for Neuroscience , Bordeaux , France ) . Objects appearing in pH 5 . 5 images were then considered bona fide CCVs if they were visible for more than 3 frames ( 8 to 12 s ) , if their signal to noise ratio was high enough , and if a cluster pre - existed where they appeared for at least 5 frames ( 20 to 24 s ) in pH 7 . 4 images ( for more details , see ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) ) . Detections were then plotted against time to produce the cumulative frequency plots presented here . For each recording , the frequency of events in both cell attached and whole cell recordings were normalised to the basal frequency of the cell as monitored in cell attached configuration . In other words , the curves were normalised so that the number of detections at the 70 th frame of cell attached recording ( 280 s ) would be set to 100 . In this way , several cells submitted to the same treatment could be pooled into a single curve despite a great variability in their basal endocytic activity . For clarity purposes , the basal endocytic activity curves of each dataset were not represented in the figures of the main text . For reference , only that of the data set obtained from cells dialysed in the absence of blocker were illustrated ( black curves ) . Also , SEM were omitted . Complete representations of each of the datasets used in this study can be found in Figure S2 . Lack of cell attached recordings for the data set presented in Figure 8 prevented the faithful monitoring of basal endocytic activity . Consequently , normalisation was performed at 2 min of whole cell recording . The inhibition efficiency of the blocker was then calculated as Results 218 where F is the frequency of events in the indicated time interval and the subscript is the recording in which it is being measured ( CA : cell attached , WC : whole cell ) .

Cauvin , PhD student , and A . Echard , director of the " Membrane Traffic and Cell Division Lab " at the Pasteur Institute in Paris . I present here an abstract of the work performed by C . Cauvin on the recruitment of OCRL by the Rab35 GTPase at early stages of endosomal trafficking after vesicle formation and its implication on the intracellular trafficking of the cation - independent mannose 6 - phosphate receptor by a disregulation of PIP 2 homeostasis . Scientific contribution : This project was an opportunity to use the ppH protocol in order to dissect the precise timing of recruitment of Rab35 , OCRLb and two regulators of the Rab35 GTPase with respect to the scission of CCVs from the PM . HeLa cells were transfected with TfR - SEP or TfR - pHuji together with Rab35 - mCherry , its effector OCRLb - mCherry , its GEF DENND1A - EGFP or its GAP Epi64B - mCherry . We show that Rab35 and OCRLb are recruited simultaneously after vesicle formation , immediately following the recruitment of Rab35 ' s activator DENND1A and the disappearance of its inhibitor EPI64B . Conclusions & Perspectives : This work should lead to a scientific publication ( article in preparation ) . The characterisation of this molecular switch highlights the need for novel imaging techniques to unravel unknown protein - protein interaction networks .

Our laboratory has recently shown that the Rab35 GTPase recruits and directly interacts with the PIP 2 5 ' - phosphatase OCRL in late cytokinesis bridges connecting the daughter cells . This is essential for a normal abscission by preventing local PIP 2 and actin accumulation in the intercellular bridge ( Kouranti et al . , 2006 ; Dambournet et al . , 2011 ; Chesneau et al . , 2012 ) . Mutations in OCRL are responsible for the Oculo - Cerebro - Renal Syndrome of Lowe , a rare genetic disease characterised by renal proximal tubular dysfunction , which likely results from defects in the endosomal pathway ( Vicinanza et al . , 2011 ) . How OCRL is localised to endosomes remains a key question . Since the Rab35 GTPase is located on the endosomal system ( Kouranti et al . , 2006 ) we hypothesised that Rab35 may recruit OCRL on endosomes to prevent actin accumulation at their surface , by analogy with our results during cytokinesis . This may be regulted by a balance between its GAP Epi64B ( Chesneau et al . , 2012 ) and its GEF DENND1A ( Allaire et al . , 2010 ) . Remarkably , the levels of lysosomal enzymes in the plasma and urine are increased in Lowe patients , suggesting defects in the intracellular T HE R AB 35 M OLECULAR S WITCH 229 trafficking of the cation - independent mannose 6 - phosphate receptor ( CI - MPR ) ( Ungewickell and Majerus , 1999 ; Norden et al . , 2008 ; Vicinanza et al . , 2011 ) . Consistent with our hypothesis , we found that 1 ) OCRL and Rab35 colocalised on CI - MPR - positive vesicles , 2 ) depletion of either Rab35 or OCRL yielded to an accumulation of CI - MPR to peripheral early endosomes associated with PIP 2 - binding proteins and actin - nucleating complexes , and 3 ) depletion of either Rab35 or OCRL delayed CI - MPR trafficking from endosomes to TGN . Interestingly , TIRF microscopy revealed that Rab35 and OCRL were recruited simultaneously in clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCV ) precisely after their scission from the plasma membrane . We found that Rab35 indeed recruits OCRL at this stage in order to hydrolyse PIP 2 and to prevent F - actin accumulation on newly - born endosomes . This study suggests that Rab35 critically controls the timing of OCRL recruitment on clathrin - coated endosomes , and promotes PIP 2 hydrolysis and consequently normal trafficking in the endosomal system . Personal contribution : I have acquired , processed and analysed data to determine the recruitment profiles of proteins involved in the Rab35 molecular switch together with Clothilde Cauvin . The obtained results are presented in Figure 1 . Figure 1 : Recruitment profiles of proteins involved in the Rab35 molecular switch Normalised average fluorescence of endocytic events detected in cells cotransfected with TfR - SEP and Rab35 - mCherry ( n = 9 cells , red curve ) overlaid with that of cells cotransfected with ( Left ) TfR - SEP and OCRLb - mCherry ( n = 7 , green curve ) , ( Middle ) TfR - pHuji and DENND1A ( n = 4 , blue curve ) or ( Right ) TfR - SEP and Epi64B ( n = 7 , purple curve ) . Note that Rab35 builds up at CCPs a little before scission ( i . e . 2 s before detection at time 0 ) whereas OCRLb does not . Epi64B , Rab35 ' s GAP , is maximally recruited at this time . This may suggest that Rab35 accumulates before scission in its GDP bound state and therefore does not recruit its effector OCRLb . At the time of scission however , Rab35 ' s GEF DENND1A is maximally recruited . Conincidently , Epi64B gradually disappears and the slope of Rab35 recruitment changes . Rab35 may thus be predominantly in its GTP bound state from this step onwards . Consistently , OCRLb is rapidly recruited just at the time of vesicle formation and peaks simultaneously with Rab35 14 - 18 s after scission . Results 230 References : Allaire , P . D . , Marat , A .

Both mechanistically and functionally speaking , studying CME is a demanding field for those trying to elucidate its modes of action . Considering its complexity , direct visualisation of the various steps of this process using microscopy techniques has been a method of choice in the field . By combining functional perturbations of the system , using genetic or chemical manipulations , and imaging as a readout , the scientific community have deciphered key mechanisms regulating initiation , maturation , and scission of newly forming endocytic vesicles . Neurobiology is an exciting discipline in which endocytosis plays key cellular functions . Besides its well studied role in synaptic vesicle recycling , it is implicated in regulating the strength of synaptic transmission by controlling the number of AMPARs present at the PSD of excitatory neurons . However , neurons display a number of characteristics making the use of conventional imaging and perturbation techniques difficult to apply in those cells . First , CCSs are optically static at the postsynaptic level . Second , the high compartmentalisation of dendrites and spines suggests a local specialisation of CCSs . And third , the finely tuned encoding of neural activity may require a temporal regulation of receptor internalisation . Taking these observations into consideration , we decided to use the only existing imaging method that enables the unambiguous mapping of vesicle formation within a few seconds of cargo internalisation , namely the pulsed - pH protocol . A number of applications and variations around this technique were presented in the Methodological developments and Results sections of this manuscript . In particular , I showed that it could be used to demonstrate the differential sorting of two receptors , though both concentrated at CCSs , at the level of vesicle formation . I also used it to visualise the endocytic activity of static CCSs in hippocampal neurons . I thus provide preliminary data about the spatial and temporal regulation of NMDA induced internalisation of AMPARs , a phenomenon proposed to support cognitive processes such as learning and memory at the cellular and molecular level . Finally , I made use of its quantitative nature to validate the inhibitory efficiency of candidate peptides with the aim of developing of photoactivatable inhibitor of endocytosis . Taken together , these results provide insights on the mechanisms and regulation of CME in various cellular models . I have provided in - depth discussions of Discussion and Perspectives 232 these results in each of the dedicated articles , published and in preparation , presented in the Results section . In the present section , I shall thus try to discuss transversal aspects of such regulation as well as propose some perspectives about what remains to be investigated based on the results obtained so far . A DVANTAGES O F T HE PP H P ROTOCOL As argued a number of times in this manuscript , we consider that the ppH protocol is the most appropriate method to visualise endocytosis . It indeed reports on the formation of a new vesicle and not on the state or presence of endocytic proteins associated with vesicle formation . This particularity allows for a direct assessment of cargo internalisation regardless of assumptions drawn from the canonical model of vesicle formation . Studying whether other modes of endocytosis exist can therefore be achieved with no bias regarding the function of known proteins or the timing with which the process is believed to take place . A . Plaques , pits , buds and vesicles The presence of clathrin in the TIRF illumination field is often taken as a correlate for the presence of an endocytic zone . These punctae are together referred to as CCSs , standing for clathrin coated structures . These structures can be broken down into clathrin plaques , clathrin coated pits ( CCPs ) and clathrin coated vesicles ( CCVs ) . It has been proposed , by one group in particular , that pits and plaques form differently such that pits would grow by continuous polymerisation of clathrin around invaginating membranes while plaques would consist of flat clathrin lattices that would altogether detach from the adherent surface of the glass coverslip ( Saffarian et al . , 2009 ) . On the basis of data acquired with the ppH protocol , we argue that pits and plaques , as observed by electron microscopy or by studying clathrin lifetimes and intensities , may be what we visualise as terminal or non - terminal events respectively . This proposition may be in contradiction with two observations made by the group mentionned above . First , they argue that plaques do not occur in BSC1 cells . When applying the ppH protocol to this cell line , we however measured an average of 65 . 1 ± 3 . 0 % of non - terminal events ( i . e . a value close to the 68 . 1 ± 3 . 0 % of non - terminal events found in NIH - 3T3 cells which they found display at least 70 % of plaques ) . Second , they argue that plaques can internalise while remaining as flat structures whereas ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) showed that terminal and non - terminal events recruit all major proteins involved in CME with similar kinetics except for coat - associated proteins . A DVANTAGES O F T HE PP H P ROTOCOL 233 This implies that BAR - domain containing proteins in particular are also recruited to non - terminal events which may not be consistent with the inward movement of a flat plaque . However , this view is consistent with a number of other observations and could explain some of our own results . Non - terminal events could for example consist of vesicles budding from the edges of flat plaques . Such appositions of lattices and invaginated pits are commonly observed by electron microscopy in a variety of cell lines ( Fujimoto et al . , 2000 ; Traub , 2009 ; Collins et al . , 2011 ) . In this model , the pits , whether or not connected to a plaque , would mediate cargo internalisation , whereas the plaques would not be involved in endocytosis per se . They could constitute reservoirs of coat elements for the formation of CCPs by polymerisation and depolymerisation on their sides . Also , our data about the differential endocytosis of β2AR and TfR would be consistent with a role for clathrin coated plaques in maintaining some receptors surface bound . For example , excluding signalling receptors from vesicles may play a role in regulating the duration for which they can signal . Release from the plaque and into an adjacent pit for uptake could then be triggered by the arrival of intracellular CLASPs binding to ubiquitylated cargo ( Henry et al . , 2012 ) . Finally , the plaque / pit model may be the canonical endocytic structure found in the postsynapse . This view could provide an explanation for the static behaviour of CCSs in this compartment despite being endocytically active as demonstrated in this work . It would also be consistent with results obtained by immuno - gold labelling of clathrin , AP - 2 and dynamin which showed that endocytic proteins are concentrated on the side of spine heads even in the absence of any invagination ( Rácz et al . , 2004 ) . Other structures may similarly require the presence of clathrin at the plasma membrane independently of its endocytic function , such as focal adhesion sites ( Batchelder and Yarar , 2010 ) , epithelial microvilli ( Boulant et al . , 2011 ) or costameres in muscle cells ( Vassilopoulos et al . , 2014 ) . By distinguishing between the presence of clathrin and the formation of an endocytic vesicle , the ppH protocol can shed new light on the regulation of such processes . B . Pinpointing cargo internalisation An important question regarding the possible specialisation of CCSs for AMPARs in neurons is whether this specialisation is spatial or functional . In other words , whether synaptic CCSs internalise AMPARs because they are adequately localised in spine heads where the receptor is enriched or because they are molecularly distinct from other CCPs , conferring them the ability to interact with AMPARs . Some groups have addressed this issue by observing the distribution of AMPAR or TfR containing endosomes by immunocytochemistry . By detecting an overlap between the two ( Ehlers , 2000 ; Lee et al . , 2001 ) , or the lack thereof ( Beattie et al . , 2000 ; Glebov et al . , 2015 ) , they conclude that the two receptors are identically or differentially internalised Discussion and Perspectives 234 or sorted through the endosomal system . As highlighted in the discussion of the related article in the previous section , this assay does not have the required temporal resolution to distinguish between internalisation and sorting . It is thus possible that the discrepancies observed by the different groups arise from differing protocols such as the fact that they quantify the degree of colocalisation under basal or NMDA stimulated conditions or at various timepoints after stimulation . Our results using the ppH protocol to map AMPAR and TfR internalisation do not indicate a preferential uptake of either receptor in the vicinity of synapses , neither before , during nor after stimulation . They therefore do not support the hypothesis of a spatial specificity of CME around PSDs . However , they do not directly demonstrate nor reject whether AMPARs could be internalised in molecularly specific CCPs . It could be interesting to use pHuji and SEP tagged receptors to investigate whether the internalisation of both receptors can be visualised simultaneously . This experiment may prove difficult to perform in combination with NMDA stimulation since it requires the use of the pTry protocol , which may not quench pHuji fluorescence . It could however provide an answer to this long standing question under basal conditions by using the ppH protocol . I MAGING E NDOGENOUS E NDOCYTOSIS The ppH protocol and its pTry variant have overcome a number of issues limiting the validity of the classical " CCS lifetime measurement analysis " . However , an obvious potential limitation still remains : they require the overexpression of cargo . A . Limitations of cargo overexpression Overexpression of TfR may be acceptable to study many aspects of constitutive CME ( concentration at CCPs , protein recruitment etc . ) but it was shown to increase CCS lifetimes ( Loerke et al . , 2009 ) . Whether this means that it altogether slows the kinetics of vesicle formation or whether it merely increases the proportion of non - terminal events cannot be deduced as long as no assay enables the visualisation of endocytic vesicles filled with endogenous cargo . Also , overexpression of a given cargo may interfere with the recruitment of other cargos binding to the same adaptor ( Warren et al . , 1998 ; Schmid and McMahon , 2007 ) . Since TfR and β2AR bind to AP - 2 and β - arrestin respectively , and because both receptors were overexpressed , this consideration should not have been problematic in our study reporting their differential internalisation in CCVs . Indeed , the rate of TfR - I MAGING E NDOGENOUS E NDOCYTOSIS 235 pHuji loaded vesicle formation was not altered as SEP - β2AR internalisation increased upon application of isoproterenol ( Shen et al . , 2014 ) . Nevertheless , it may limit the applicability of this dual imaging technique when considering pairs of receptors binding to the same adaptor . This could be the case for example if we look at the internalisation of TfRs and AMPARs since GluA2 also binds AP - 2 ( Lee et al . , 2002 ; Kastning et al . , 2007 ) . Moreover , even though the AP - 2 binding motifs of these two receptors are different ( TfR harbours a canonical YXXΦ motif ( YTRF ) while GluA2 harbours an atypical KRMK basic motif ) , both bind AP - 2 via its µ2 subunit . On the other hand , if these two receptors do compete for internalisation in CCPs , it may provide an explanation for the reduced internalisation rate of TfR that we observed during NMDA application . As AMPARs would be destabilised from synapses and diffuse to CCPs , TfR would be excluded from those pits and be less internalised than under basal conditions even if the endocytic activity of the pits themselves remains unchanged . This purely speculative hypothesis may be difficult to investigate while the ppH protocol still requires the overexpression of cargos to monitor vesicle formation since the conditions for competition may differ depending on the extent of overexpression . B . Perspectives for the visualisation of endogenous cargo internalisation As illustrated in the Methodological developments section , I have made several attempts to visualise the internalisation of endogenous cargos by testing a few adaptations of the ppH protocol . Disappointingly , neither the quenching of Q - dots with BCG ( inspired from ( Valentine et al . , 2012 ) ) nor the quenching of Tfn - Alexa488 with BPB ( inspired from ( Harata et al . , 2006 ) ) or trypan purple was enough to distinguish the formation of endocytic vesicles from the PM . Another alternative could have been to use Alexa488 - labelled antibodies directed against TfR . Indeed , it is posible that our failure to quench labelled Tfn was due to a limited accessibility of the fluorophore upon ligand binding to the receptor . Also , such a technique could be universally applied to visualise the internalisation of any receptor with known antibodies targeted against them . However , the propensity of antibodies to crosslink their targets ( thus potentially inducing artificial cargo clustering ) and their relatively large size ( possibly limiting cargo loading in vesicles ) argued against our testing this alternative . Using the newly developed monovalent antibody fragments ( Fab ) targeted against TfR could potentially circumvent these issues ( Niewoehner et al . , 2014 ) . An ideal tool for the purpose of visualising endogenous cargo internalisation would be a Tfn - SEP fusion protein . Such a tool would combine the high affinity and specificity of Tfn for constitutive endocytosis and the efficiency of SEP quenching by low Discussion and Perspectives 236 pH solutions . However , recombinant Tfn is particularly difficult to obtain . The production of full - length Tfn by classical expression in a bacterial system has indeed not yet been reported ( Mason et al . , 1993 ; Steinlein and Ikeda , 1993 ) . To circumvent this issue , we could use unnatural ligands of TfR such as aptamers . Single strand DNA based aptamers targeting murine ( Chen et al . , 2008 ) or human ( Wilner et al . , 2012 ) TfR have been identified . These probes have already been used to visualise TfR recycling by super - resolution microscopy ( Opazo et al . , 2012 ) and should in theory be easily fused to SEP considering their encodable nature . With the increasing need for ever smaller probes , more and more aptamers targeting a variety of receptors are being discovered . If applicable , this strategy could thus become quite versatile . P HOTOACTIVATION I N N EURONS The motivation for the development of a photoactivatable inhibitor of endocytosis was two - fold . First , as presented in the article in preparation , acute disruption of the protein - protein interactions involving dynamin may provide unprecedented insight on the proposed dual role of dynamin at CCPs . This strategy could also be extended to other interactions , such as between the α - and β - ear domains of the AP2 complex and many proteins involved in CME ( Praefcke et al . , 2004 ) . Peptides competing with these interactions indeed effectively block CME ( see Table 1 , p . 103 ) . Interestingly , as described in the Introduction ( Chapter 4 , § C . 2 . ) , ( Nevola et al . , 2013 ) have synthesised an azobenzene ‘stapled’ peptide , making it reversibly photo - activatable by light . Although this tool is indeed able to acutely block CME after illumination , no further characterisation has yet been performed . Using the ppH protocol , we should be able to measure the delay between photoactivation and block of CME , characterising further the temporal significance of the AP - 2 / β - arrestin interaction . Second , this tool will make it possible to acutely block endocytosis at specific times and locations , in particular in neurons . We have seen all along this manuscript that endocytosis is involved in two very important processes in neurons : synaptic vesicle recycling and the retrieval of postsynaptic receptors during LTD . Whereas the first is essentially occurring within the presynaptic terminal and tightly regulated in time , the spatio - temporal regulation of the second is much less clear . P HOTOACTIVATION I N N EURONS 237 A . Presynaptic spatio - temporal regulation In presynaptic terminals endocytosis of SV components invariably follows their exocytosis . To explain the much greater speed of this process compared to other cells , it has been proposed that coat components are preassembled in synaptic terminals ( Mueller et al . , 2004 ; Hua et al . , 2011 ) . We could envisage testing this hypothesis by photoactivating an endocytosis blocker just after stimulation . If part of the components are preassembled at the plasma membrane , preventing their recruitment right after SV exocytosis may not necessarily block all subsequent endocytosis . On the other hand , if they are being sequestered in the terminal by photoactivated peptide instead of being rapidly recruited upon stimulation , this should translate into an immediate block of SV recycling . Notably , recent evidences suggest that clathrin mediated endocytosis may not be the primary recycling pathway in presynaptic terminals ( Kononenko et al . , 2014 ; Watanabe et al . , 2014 ) . Using dynamin - derived peptides rather that interfering with AP - 2 or clathrin dependent interactions may therefore be necessary to study the precise kinetics of endocytic protein recruitment for SV retrieval from the PM . B . Postsynaptic spatio - temporal regulation As discussed in the second article of the Results section , combining the pTry protocol to bath applications of NMDA did not reveal any preferential site of AMPAR internalisation . Our data therefore does not support the idea that spatial regulation of CME may play a role in defining the synaptic specificity of LTD . In a physiological context however , NMDARs are activated by glutamate in a given spine and synaptic depression only occurs in a small set of spines around the active synapse . Locally uncaging an endocytosis blocker in activated spines may help dissect whether the synaptically localised endocytic zones of these synapses participate more to AMPAR internalisation than surrounding CCSs . Photoactivation may also answer questions about the time - window during which endocytosis is required for the expression of LTD . Antibody feeding assays following TfRs and AMPARs through the endosomal system provide contradictory results about their differential or concomitant internalisation ( Beattie et al . , 2000 ; Ehlers , 2000 ; Lee et al . , 2004 ; Glebov et al . , 2015 ) but all observe that AMPARs are rapidly routed for recycling to the PM after a few tens of minutes . This may suggest that AMPAR endocytosis is only upregulated in a short time - window following NMDAR activation . In contradiction with this hypothesis , ( Linden , 2012 ) elegantly showed using a double patch technique , that dynasore and the D15 peptide both prevented the maintenance of electrically induced LTD when perfused up to 1 h after stimulation in Discussion and Perspectives 238 cerebellar Purkinje cells . This result therefore suggest that the maintenance of LTD requires a persistent endocytic activity . In this set of experiments , ( Linden , 2012 ) shows that blocking endocytosis late after LTD induction results in a return to basal synaptic strength levels within ~ 45 min . This gradual increase in AMPAR EPSC amplitude most probably results from the accumulation of AMPARs at the cell surface as they can no longer internalise ( Lüscher et al . , 1999 ) . However , dialysis of the D15 peptide , especially in the furthest and thinnest dendrites , may be rate limiting to study the kinetics of this recovery . Letting a caged peptide dialyse inside the cell before inducing LTD and uncaging at chosen time points may therefore result in more immediate effects . 239 Conclusion This manuscript provided an in depth account of the work performed throughout my PhD on the study of the spatio - termporal regulation of endocytosis . I described the motivations for this work , lying in the complex molecular networks at play during plasticity induced receptor internalisation in the brain . I reported three methodological contributions to optically visualise and perturb vesicle formation . I hope these tools will prove useful to the scientific community to unravel new regulatory mechanisms when combined with other novel technologies and ideas . 240 References Aarts , M . , Liu , Y . , Liu , L . , Besshoh , S . , Arundine , M . , Gurd , J .

INTRODUCTION L ' endocytose est un mécanisme fondamental des cellules eukaryotes via lequel elles peuvent réguler la composition biochimique de leur membrane plasmique et internaliser des nutriments ou pathogènes . Elle est également est impliqué dans un grand nombre de processus physiologiques allant de l ' adérence et la migration cellulaire à la régulation de la tansmission synaptique en passant par la signalisation intracellulaire , la réponse immunitaire et la dégradation ou le recyclage de protéines ( McMahon et Boucrot , 2011 ) . Il existe plusieurs voies d ' endocytose , la plus étudiée d ' entre toutes étant connue sous le nom d ' endocytose médiée par la clathrine ( EDC ) . A . 1 . Méchanismes moléculaires de l ' EDC l ' EDC nécessite la formation de vésicules issues d ' une invagination progressive de la membrane plasmique . Ces vésicules , se forment en quelques minutes grâce à l ' action concertée de nombreuses protéines ( Figure 5 , p . 39 ) . - La clathrine forme le manteau recouvrant les zones d ' endocytose . Elle peut s ' oligomériser pour former des trimères en forme de triskels qui peuvent ensuite oligomériser à nouveau jusqu ' à l ' obtention de plaques ou de cages sphériques d ' environ 150 nm , caractérisées par une structure en nids d ' abeille ( Figure 6 , p . 39 ; Figure 11 , p . 44 ) . Bien que le domaine terminal de la clathrine constitue une véritable platerforme d ' interaction pour de nombreuses protéines impliquées dans l ' endocytose , celle - ci ne peut se lier directement ni à la membrane plasmique , où elle initie le processus d ' endocytose , ni au cargo à internaliser , tels que des récepteurs membranaires ( Schmid and McMahon , 2007 ) . - Le complexe AP - 2 est formé de 4 sous - unités , deux larges sous - unités α et β , une moyenne μ et une petite σ , et sert d ' adaptateur reliant à la fois la clathrine , la membrane plasmique et un grand nombre de cargos ( Figure 7 , p . 40 ) . Notemment , AP - 2 270 est la protéine adaptatice permettant l ' internalisation du récepteur à la transferrine ( R - Tf ) , un réceptuer exclusivement endocyté par l ' EDC souvent utilisé comme cargo modèle pour étudier cette voie d ' endocytose . Il existe d ' autres protéines adaptatrices permettant d ' internaliser spécifiquement certains cargos , comme par exemple la β - arrestine , recrutée aux puits d ' endocytose suite à la stimulation de récepteurs couplés aux protéines G ( RCPG ) tels que le récepteur beta2 - adrénergique ( R - β2A ) ( Figure 10 , p . 43 ) . AP - 2 est localisé à tous les site d ' EDC et constitue , au même tire que la clathrine elle même , une plateforme d ' interactions pour un grand nombre de protéines ( Collins et al . , 2002 ; Schmid et al . , 2006 ) . - Les protéines à domaine BAR sont impliquées dans l ' initiation et l ' avancement des changements morphologiques imposés sur la membrane plasmique au cours du processus d ' endocytose . Celle - ci doit en effet passer d ' une topologie quasiement plate à un puits sphérique fortement invaginé ( Figure 9 , p 41 ) . Les protéine à domaine BAR forment des dimères dont la forme concave leur permettent de sentir et d ' induire le courbure de la membrane ( Gallic et al . , 2012 ; Takei et al . , 1996 ; Suarez et al . , 2014 ) . Le recrutment séquentiel de plusieurs protéines à domaine BAR de courbures différentes aux sites d ' endocytose ainsi que la capacité de certaines d ' entre elles à insérer des hélices amphipatiques dans les membrane pour les déformer encore plus sont deux processus qui ont été proposés pour expliquer l ' avancement progressif de l ' invagination des puits d ' endocytose ( Qualmann et al . , 2011 ) ( Figure 12 , p . 45 ; Figure 13 , p . 46 ) . - La dynamine est la protéine permettant la scission membranaire . Cette GTPase de 100 kDa est organisée en domaines distincts ( Ferguson et De Camilli , 2012 ) : le domaine G lie et hydrolyse le GTP , le BSE subit d ' importants réarangements conformationnels lorsque la dynamine hydrolyse le GTP , le domaine stalk ( ' tige ' ) permet à la dynamine de dimériser , le domaine PH la lie à la membrane plasmique et le domain riche en proline ( DRP ) intéragit avec des protéines contenant des domaines SH3 tels que les protéines à domaine BAR endophiline et amphiphysine ( Figure 8 , p . 41 ; Figure 14 , p . 47 ; Figure 15 , p . 49 ) . Fonctionnellement parlant , la dynamine est recrutée au cou de vésicules en formation via les intéractions entre son domaine DRP et des protéine à domaine SH3 . Elle s ' oligomérise alors en forme d ' anneau autour du cou de la vésicule . Dans cette configuration , un domaine G d ' un dimère de dynamine ( i ) peut intéragir avec le domaine G d ' un dimère de dynamine ( i + 1 ) . Cette interaction va entrainer une augmentation de l ' activité enzymatique des domaines G résultant en l ' hydrolyse de GTP . Cette réaction va induire d ' importants changements de conformation dans le domaine BSE de la dynamine tels que l ' annau va glisser sur lui même jusqu ' à constrire le cou de la vésicule de plus en plus . Cette constriction va entrainer une fragilité au niveau des lipides de la membrane à l ' endroit où la cage de clathrine s ' arrête et l ' anneau de dynamine commence , résultant en la scision de la membrane et la formation d ' une vésicule ( résumé dans ( Roux , 2014 ) ) . 271 Pour visualiser la formation de vésicules d ' endocytose , la méthode la plus classique consiste à observer par microscopie de fluorescence la dynamique d ' un unique puits recourvert de clathrine dans une cellule marquée avec de la clathrine fluorescente . Puisque , canoniquement , l ' EDC commence par le recrutement de clathrine à la membrane plasmique et s ' achève par le déshabillage de la vésicule de son manteau de clathrine et d ' AP - 2 , la disparition du signal de clathrine est considéré comme découlant de la formation d ' une nouvelle vésicule ( Figure 18 , p . 53 ) . Cependant , ce mode de visualisation est indirect puisqu ' il ne détecte pas à proprement parler la formation de la vésicule mais bien la dynamique du manteau de clathrine . Il a donc été suggéré que parfois , la clathrine pourrait se désoligomériser sans qu ' une vésicule ne soit créée , ou bien au contraire , que certaines vésicules pourraient être formée sans qu ' aucune modification ne soit visible à l ' échelle optique du point de vue de la structure de clathrine observée . Pour contourner ces limitations , une autre méthode appelée ppH a récemment été développée pour observer la formation de vésicules d ' endocytose de manière directe et quantitative . Ce protocol isole la fluorescence de vésicules , chargées en R - Tf marqué avec un fluorophore sensible au pH , de la fluorescence des récepteurs de surface grace à une application séquentielle rapide de solution à pH acid aux alentours de la cellule observée ( Figure 20 , p . 55 ; Figure 51 , p . 118 ) . Ce protocol sera détaillé de manière plus approfondie dans la partie Matériels et Méthodes . A . 2 . Neurotransmission et plasticité Le cerveau est composé de cellules gliales et de neurones . Les neurones sont le siège d ' une intense communication de cellule à cellule dont la régulation contrôle nos mouvements , notre perception de l ' environnement , nos émotions , nos capacités cognitives et notre comportement . Le point de contact entre deux neurones où se transmet l ' information électrochimique codant pour ces processus s ' appelle une synapse . Une synapse chimique excitatrice est composée d ' un bouton de neurone présynaptique et d ' une épine dendritique d ' un neurone postsynaptique ( Figure 23 , p . 60 ; Figure 24 , p . 62 ) . La transmission synaptique se fait en trois étapes : 1 ) Le bouton présynaptique est rempli de vésicules synaptiques ( VS ) . Ces vésicules , chargées en neurotransmetteur tels que le glutamate , sont exocytées en réponse à l ' arrivée d ' un potentiel d ' action qui va dépolariser le bouton et permettre l ' ouverture de cannaux calciques . Le placement méticuleux des VS près de ces cannaux et la présence d ' un censeur de calcium sur chacune des vésicules permet un déclenchement extrèmement rapide ( ~ 1 ms ) de leur exocytose ( Figure 32 , p . 75 ) . 2 ) Le glutamate relargé par exocytose des VS diffuse dans la fente synaptique séparant les neurones pré - et postsynaptiques . 272 3 ) Le glutamate se lie à des récepturs postsynaptiques se trouvant à la surface des épines dendritiques ce qui va entrainer une dépolarisation du neurone postsynaptique et permettre la transmission du signal électrique . Les épines dendritiques sont moléculairement très complexes et hautement organisées . A la tête de l ' épine se trouve la densité postsynaptique ( DPS ) où sont concentrés de nombreux récepteurs , tels que les récepteurs au glutamate de type AMPA ( R - AMPA ) et de type NMDA ( R - NMDA ) , des protéines d ' échaffaudage , telles que PSD - 95 et Homer , ainsi que de l ' actine et ses nombreux régulateurs ( Figure 26 , p . 66 ) . Les R - AMPA sont responsables de la transmission excitatrice rapide des neurones . Ce récepteur , constitué de 4 sous - unités ( de GluA1 à GluA4 , Figure 27 , p . 67 ) , est perméable au sodium et s ' ouvre en présence de glutamate . Le nombre de R - AMPA à la DPS détermine la force de la synapse tel que plus de R - AMPA induiront de plus grands courants synaptiques que peu de R - AMPA . La force d ' une synapse peut - être modulée physiologiquement par un phénomène connu sous le nom de plasticité synaptique . Cette plasticité peut - être bidirectionnelle telle que la synapse peut - être potentiée , c ' est à dire augmentée , ou bien déprimée , c ' est à dire diminuée . De telles modifications de la force d ' une synapse peuvent durer sur différentes échelles de temps allant de quelques secondes à plusieurs jours . En particulier , la potentiation à long terme ( PLT ) et la dépression à long terme ( DLT ) sont particulièrement étudiés pour leur implication dans la formation et le maintien de la mémoire ( Figure 29 , p . 70 ; Figure 30 , p . 71 ) . Ces deux processus dépendent fortement du nombre de R - AMPA à la DPS et sont régulés par de nombreux mécanismes cellulaires dont l ' exo - et l ' endocytose . A . 3 . L ' endocytose dans les neurones : les questions biologiques Le bouton présynaptique est le siège d ' une intense activité d ' exo - et d ' endocytose . L ' exocytose de VS est l ' un des processus de traffic membranaire les plus étudiés ( Südhof , 2013 ) . En revanche , l ' étude des méchanismes responsables de l ' endocytose permettant le recyclage de VS après leur exocytose est un intense sujet de recherche et de débat à l ' heure actuel . Alors que l ' EDC est reconnue comme indispensable pour un recyclage normal de VS , de nombreux autres mécanismes ont été proposés tels que le kiss - and - run ( Zhang et al . , 2009 ) , l ' endocytose bulk ( ' en vrac ' ) ( Smith et al . , 2008 ) et l ' endocytose ultra - rapide ( Watanabe et al . , 2013 ) . Du côté postsynaptique , peu d ' études se sont intéressées au mode d ' endocytose régulant le traffic des R - AMPA et il est conventionnellement accepté que celle - ci se fait via l ' EDC ( Carroll et al . , 1999 ; Lee et al . , 2002 ; Kastning et al . 2007 ; mais voir Glebov et al . , 2015 ) . Bien que les mécanismes moléculaires régulant la DLT sont à ce jour mal connus , il est largement accepté que dans les neurones d ' hippocampe , la DLT peut être initiée par l ' entrée de calcium dans le neurone postsynpatique suite à 273 l ' activation de R - NMDA et résulter en l ' endocytose de R - AMPA provoquant la diminution de la force synaptique charactéristique de la DLT ( Malinow et Malenka , 2002 ) . En effet , inhiber l ' endocytose spécifiquement dans un neurone postsynaptique empêche le maintient de la DLT ( Lüscher et al . , 1999 ; Figure 47 , p . 104 ) et activer les R - NMDA chimiquement par application de son agoniste NMDA et de son co - agoniste glycine induit l ' internalisation de R - AMPA ( Beattie et al . , 2000 ; Lee et al . , 2004 ; Lin et Huganir , 2007 ; Rathje et al . , 2013 ; Figure 36B , p . 84 ) ainsi qu ' une altération de la transmission synaptique ( Lee et al . 1998 ) . Concernant l ' organisation spatiale des zones d ' endocytose dans les dendrites postsynaptiques , des structures de clathrine peuvent être observées par microscopie optique ou électronique en étroite proximité des synapses ( Lüscher et al . , 2000 ; Blanpied et al . , 2002 ; Cooney et al . , 2002 ; Tao - Cheng et al . 2011 ; Figure 37 , p . 85 ) . Cependant , dans des neurones vivants , ces structures apparaissent optiquement statiques ( Figure 36A , p . 84 ) et il devient donc impossible de visualiser la formation de vésicules d ' endocytose en observant la disparition d ' un signal de clathrine fluorescente comme il est courant de faire dans d ' autres types cellulaires . A . 4 . L ' endocytose dans les neurones : un défi technique Combinée à de nombreuses études fonctionnelles , la possibilité de visualiser la formation de vésicules d ' endocytose à partir de zones recourvertes de clathrine uniques dans des lignées cellulaires a grandement participé à notre compréhension des mécanismes moléculaires régulant ce processus et décrits en § A . 1 . de ce résumé . A l ' inverse , puisque le marquage de zones d ' endocytose par la clathrine ne révèle pas l ' activité d ' endocytose des neurones , les neurobiologistes sont limités à des méthodes de faible résolution spatiale et temporelle pour observer l ' augmentation de l ' internalisation des R - AMPA suite à la stimulation des R - NMDA pendant la DLT . - La microscopie électronique ou la microscopie de super - résolution permettent d ' observer avec une excellent résolution spatiale les profiles de zones d ' endocytose mais ne donnent presque aucune information sur les cinétiques d ' internalisation des récepteurs observés . - Les tests d ' internalisation d ' anticorps sont très utilisés pour regarder à l ' internalisation de R - AMPA . Ils consistent à fixer un anticorps marqué reconnaissant les R - AMPA sur des neurones vivants , les laisser se faire endocyter avec les R - AMPA suite à l ' induction de la DLT , fixer les cellules et détecter la fraction d ' anticorps internalisée ( Figure 36B , p . 84 ) . Bien que ces tests permettent d ' observer de manière plus ou moins quantitative l ' internalisation de R - AMPA , leur résolution temporelle est limitée par le temps nécessaire pour induire la DLT puis fixer les cellules et leur résolution temporelle permet d ' observer la destination endosomale des R - AMPA mais pas le lieu précis de leur internalisation depuis une zone recouverte de clathrine à la membrane plasmique . 274 - Le développement d ' un protéine verte sensible au pH appelée SEP ( Sankaranarayanan et al . , 2000 ) a révolutionné l ' étude dynamique des processus de traffic membranaire . Elle a très vite été utilisée pour observer l ' exocytose de VS aux boutons présynaptiques . En effet , les endosomes et vésicules intracellulaires sont à un pH inférieur à 6 alors que le milieu extracellulaire est à pH neutre . Ainsi , lorsque la SEP passe de l ' intérieur d ' une vésicule à l ' extérieur de la cellule par exocytose , elle devient brusquement fluorescente de manière facilement détectable . A l ' inverse , les vésicules d ' endocytose nouvellement formées depuis la membrane plasmique sont acidifiées avant de fusionner avec des endosomes intracellulaires . La disparition progressive de la fluorescence de la SEP après sa brusque augmentation dûe à l ' exocytose des VS est donc attribuée à de l ' endocytose ( Figure 41 , p . 92 ) . En postsynaptique , une diminution de fluorescence de SEP fusionnée à une sous - unité de R - AMPA ( SEP - GluA2 ) peut également être observée suite à l ' activation de R - NMDA ( Figure 42 , p . 93 ) . Cette méthode permet donc de visualiser la cinétique d ' internalisation des R - AMPA avec un bonne résolution temporelle mais ne détecte pas de vésicules d ' endocytose uniques et présente donc une faible résolution spatiale . De plus , la diminution du signal SEP est une mesure indirecte de l ' endocytose puisqu ' elle mesure l ' acidification de l ' environnement du récepteur . Or , une étude récente suggère que l ' activation des R - NMDA pourrait engendrer une acidification intracellulaire des neurones , rendant difficile la décorrélation entre la diminution de fluorescence dûe à l ' endocytose des R - AMPA et celle dûe à l ' acidification de la cellule ( Rathje et al . , 2013 ) .  Dans cette introduction , j ' ai abordé succintement les mécanismes moléculaires régulant l ' EDC telle qu ' elle est décrite dans des lignées cellulaires . J ' ai également expliqué comment l ' endocytose pouvait fonctionnellement réguler la transmission synaptique dans les neurones en influençant sur le nombre de R - AMPA à la surface des dendrites via un processus connu sous le nom de DLT . Cependant l ' étude des mécanismes moléculaire impliqués dans l ' endocytose neuronale est limitée par le fait que la clathrine apparait statique dans ces cellules et ne peut être visualisée avec la résolution spatiale et temporelle nécessaire à la bonne compréhension de la régulation de ce processus .  275 B . OBJECTIFS L ' objectif de ma thèse a été de développer de nouveaux outils pour étudier la régulation moléculaire et cellulaire de l ' EDC dans les cellules vivantes avec un intérêt particuler pour comprendre l ' organisation spatiale et temporelle du traffic des R - AMPA à la postsynapse , en conditions basale et après induction de la DLT . De nombreuses questions existent encore sur le sujet : Les mécanismes moléculaires régissant l ' endocytose neuronale sont - ils les mêmes que le modèle cannonique de l ' endocytose décrit dans d ' autres types cellulaires ? L ' augmentation de l ' internalisation des R - AMPA au cours de la DLT provient - elle d ' une activation spécifique des zones d’endocytose proches des synapses déprimées ? Si oui , cette régulation fait - elle suite au protocole d’induction de la DLT ? Et est - elle transitoire ou bien de longue durée ? Puisque contrairement à d ' autres types cellulaires , il n ' existe à ce jour aucune méthode directe pour visualiser l ' endocytose dans les dendrites de neurones , j ' ai divisé mon travail en trois probélmatiques secondaires : - Afin d ' élucider si certaines zones d ' endocytose pouvaient être spécialisées dans l ' internalisation de certains récepteurs j ' ai cherché à pouvoir visualiser simultanément l ' endocytose de 2 récepteurs différents . Pour cela , j ' ai charactérisé une nouvelle protéine rouge sensible au pH et montré qu ' elle pouvait être utilisée en combinaison avec la SEP pour étudier le tri différentiel de récepteurs . - J ' ai ensuite développé une nouvelle méthode d ' imagerie permettant de détecter la formation de vésicules d ' endocytose uniques dans les neurones vivants . En adaptant la méthode du ppH pour le rendre applicable à ces cellules particulières , j ' ai pu suivre pour la première fois la cinétique d ' internalisation des R - AMPA en condition de DLT par application de NMDA . - Enfin , je suis passée de la visualisation à la perturbation aigüe de l ' endocytose . Tenant compte de la grande organisation spatiale des dendrites et épines ainsi que du codage temporel précis de la transmission synaptique , il serait intéressant de pouvoir inhiber l ' endocytose de manière spatiallement ( par exemple dans une épine unique ) et temporellement ( par exemple pendant ou après indution de la DLT ) contrôlée . J ' ai donc travaillé au développement d ' inhibiteurs de l ' endocytose photoactivables . 276 C . MATERIELS ET METHODES J ' ai décrit dans l ' introduction que la méthode classique de visualisation de formation de vésicules d ' endocytose , où l ' on détecte de la disparition du manteau de clathrine , n ' est pas applicable en neurones de par le fait que la clathrine est optiquement stable dans ces cellules . J ' ai donc choisi d ' utiliser une méthode de visualisation directe de l ' endocytose appelée ppH , qui détecte directement l ' internalisation d ' un récepteur cargo avec une résolution temporelle de 2 s ( Merrifield et al . , 2005 ; Perrais et Merrifield , 2005 ) , pour atteindre mes objectifs . De plus , la complexité morphologique des neurones et les modifications engendrées par leur activité électrique sur des échelles de temps variables incitent à pouvoir perturber ce phénomène de manière locale et aigüe . Les développements technologiques que j ' ai réalisés au cours de ma thèse ont donc principalement consisté en l ' exploration de nouvelles variantes du ppH en combinaison avec diverses techniques telles que le patch - clamp et la photoactivation . C . 1 . Le protocol ppH Le principe de ce protocole est d ' isoler la fluorescence d ' un marquage intracellulaire de celle d ' un marquage extracellulaire . Pour cela , Perrais et Merrifield ont taggué le R - Tf , constitutivement internalisé par l ' EDC , à la SEP , une variante sensible au pH de la protéine fluorescente verte GFP . Les cellule transfectée avec cette protéine fusion sont alors observée par microscopie TIRF , une technique de microscpie permettant d ' illuminer la cellule uniquement à l ' interface entre la lamelle de verre sur laquelle sont ensemencées les cellules et le milieu aqueux dans lequel elles sont maintenues ( Figure 52 , p . 119 ; Figure 53 , p . 119 ) . Ainsi , il est possible d ' observer des protéines fluorescente situées aux environs de la membrane plasmique avec un excellent rapport signal sur bruit ( Figure 39 , p . 89 ) . Au pH physiologique de 7 . 4 , les R - Tf sont visibles en points fluorescents concentrés aux puits de clathrine sur toute la surface adhérente de la cellule . Cependant , si le milieu extracellulaire est échangé pour une solution au pH légèrement acide de 5 . 5 à l ' aide d ' une pipette d ' application placée proche de la cellule enregistrée , les R - Tf se trouvant à a surface ne seront plus fluorescent ( car la SEP sera éteinte par les protons de la solution acide ) et il sera possible de distingue la fluorescence de R - Tf se trouvant dans des vésicules intracellulaires non acides . Ces vésicules correspondent à des vésicules nouvellement formées qui se sont isolées du milieu extracellulaire alors que celui - ci était encore à pH 7 . 4 ( § A . 1 . p . 127 ) . Ainsi , si le pH de la solution extracellulaire est modulé de pH 7 . 4 à pH 5 . 5 alternativement , il devient possible de détecter la formation de vésicules d ' endocytose dans le temps . Le protocol ppH fait exactement cela , en couplant l ' échange de solution avec la prise d ' image de fluorescence toutes les 2 s ( Figure 51 , p . 118 ) . 277 C . 2 . Le patch - clamp La technique du patch - clamp est très utilisée par les neurobiologistes pour enregistrer l ' activité électrique des neurones . Pour cela , ils placent une électrode en contact avec la membrane plasmique via une pipette de verre remplie d ' une solution dont la composition ionique est proche de celle du cytoplasme . Un avantage dérivé de cette technique est qu ' il devient donc possible de contôler en partie la composition du cytoplasme des cellules en modifiant la composition de la solution contenue dans la pipette . Cette technique a été utilisée pour introduire des inhibiteur d ' endocytose dans des neurones uniques . Notemment , un peptide de 15 acides - aminés appelé D15 imitant une partie du DRP de la dynamine et affectant son recrutement par l ' amphiphysine au cou de vésicules en formation , a ainsi été utilisé en pré - et en postsynaptique pour inhiber l ' EDC en quelques minutes ( Shupliakov , 1997 ; Lüscher et al . , 1999 ; Kittler et al . , 2000 ; Jockusch et al . , 2005 ; Morishita et al . , 2005 ; Wu et al . , 2009 ; Hosoi et al . , 2009 ; Glebov et al . , 2015 ; Linden , 2012 ; Table 1 , p . 103 ; Figure 47 , p . 104 ) . J ' ai combiné le patch - clamp avec le ppH afin de pouvoir comparer l ' efficacité d ' inhibition du D15 avec d ' autres peptides . Pour cela , j ' ai dialisé ces peptides dans des cellules unique tout en suivant le déclin de la fréquence d ' endocytose induite par ces inhibiteurs à l ' aide du ppH . C . 3 . La photoactivation La photoactivation permet de rendre active une molécule initialement inactive par application de lumière . Le troisième sous - objectif de ma thèse visait à rendre le D15 ou un autre peptide issu de cette séquence photoactivable . J ' ai donc mis en place les conditions techniques pour pouvoir combiner ppH , patch - clamp et photoactivation sur un même microscope . Pour ce faire , j ' ai installé une fibre optique transmettant l ' UV ( 365 nm ) le long de la pipette de changement de solution utilisée pour le ppH . J ' ai ensuite effectué des expériences préliminaires au cours desquelles j ' ai dialisé les cellules non pas avec un D15 photoactivable mais avec un inhibiteur non spécifique de l ' endocytose photoactivable : le DMNPE - GTP - γS . 278 D . RESULTATS D . 1 . pHuji : un protéine rouge fluorescente sensible au pH pour détecter l ' exo - et l ' endocytose . Article en anglais p . 143 à p . 161 Contexte : La pHluorine superecliptique ( SEP ) est un protéine verte sensible au pH très largement utilisée pour étudier les phénomène d ' exo - et d ' endocytose . Elle a notemment été utilisée en combinaison avec des marqueurs fluorescents rouges pour étudier la dynamique de protéines impliquées dans ces processus . Cependant , il serait intéressant d ' également disposer d ' une protéine rouge sensible au pH afin de détecter l ' exo - et l ' endocytose tout en rendant possible l ' imagerie 2 couleurs avec d ' autres biosenseurs bien caractérisés émettant dans le vert car dérivés de la GFP ( green fluorescent protein , ou ' protéine fluorescente verte ' ) . A ce jour , aucune des protéines sensibles au pH émettant dans le rouge ayant été décrites n ' est suffésemment sensible pour étudier l ' encoytose de récepteurs . Contribution scientifique : Nous avons collaboré avec le Pr . R . Campbell de l ' Université d’Alberta , au Canada , pour caractériser une nouvelle protéine rouge sensible au pH que nous avons appelé pHuji . Nous avons montré qu’elle est ~ 7 fois plus sensible au pH que pHTomato , un senseur de pH récemment publié ( Li et Tsien , 2012 ) . De plus , son pic d’émission est plus rouge que le mutant M163K de mOrange , connu pour sa sensibilité au pH ( Shaner et al . 2004 , 2008 ) . Cela fait donc de pHuji le meilleur senseur de pH compatible avec la SEP , ou autres dérivés de la GFP , pour l’imagerie 2 couleurs . Nous avons démontré que le pK a d ' un senseur de pH n ' étais pas le seul critère affectant sa sensibilité au pH mais que le coefficient de Hill ( n H ) , charactérisant la pente de la fluorescence en fonction du pH , influençait également sur cette sensibilité . pHuji a un n H de 1 . 10 alors que la SEP a un n H de 1 . 90 et pHTomato de 0 . 51 . Nous avons alors montré que la grande sensibilité au pH de pHuji permettait de détecter des évènements d ' endocytose uniques grâce à la technique du ppH . Bien que la sensibilité au pH de pHuji soit plus faible que celle de la SEP , ce qui nous a conduit à développer un algorithme de détection plus sensible , nous avons pu montrer que les évènements détectés avec R - Tf - pHuji étaient de réels évènements d ' endocytose se formant à des puits recouverts de clathrine et capables de recruter la dynamine . Nous avons alors pu montrer dans des cellules cotransfectées avec R - β2A - SEP , internalisés suite à l ' application d ' un agoniste , et R - Tf - pHuji , internalisé constitutivement , que ces deux récepteurs sont triés différentiellement au moment de la formation des vésicules . 279 Conclusion et Perspectives : Ce travail a révélé un nouveau niveau de contrôle pour le tri du cargo dans l’EDC . Il a donné le jour à une publication scientifique dans l ' édition de Novembre 2014 du Journal of Cell Biology . Il est donc maintenant possible de regarder à l ' endocytose simultanée de 2 types de réceptuers différents . pHuji pourra donc peut - être un jour être utilisé pour étudier si les R - AMPA sont internalisés avec les R - Tf ou bien à des sites spécifiques dans les neurones . D . 2 . Visualisation de la dynamique des zones d ' endocytose dans les dendrites neuronales Article en préparation en anglais p . 162 à p . 187 Contexte : Les récepteurs au glutamate de type AMPA ( R - AMPA ) médient la transmission synaptique rapide aux synapses excitatrices du système nerveaux central . Le nombre de R - AMPA à la densité postsynaptique ( DPS ) est régulé par un grand nombre de processus cellulaires dont l ' endocytose joue un rôle central , notamment dans l ' expression de la dépression synaptique à long tèrme ( DLT ) . Ce phénomène a été proposé comme étant un possible corrélat cellulaire de la mémoire et de l ' apprentissage mais ses méchanismes moléculaires restent largement mal connus . Une raison important pour ce manque de connaissances vient du fait que les méthodes d ' imagerie actuelles ne permettent pas de visualiser directement la formation de vésicules aux zones d ' endocytose dans ces cellules . Par exemple , bien que souvent suggéré dans la littérature , il n ' a jamais été montré si l ' endocytose des R - AMPA se fait préférentiellement au niveau des synapses ou bien si celle - ci est distribuée dans l ' ensemble du neurone après diffusion des récepteurs . Contribution scientifique : J ' ai utilisé le protocol ppH pour détecter la formation de vésicules d ' endocytose avec une résolution temporelle de 2 s dans des neurones d ' hippocampe en culture transfectés avec R - Tf - SEP . Ceci a permis de révéler pour la première fois l ' activité d ' endocytose aux zones recouvertes de clathrines optiquement statiques dans des neurones vivants . Cependant l ' application de solution acide provoque , toutes les 2 s , l’activation de canaux ASIC dans les neurones . J’ai trouvé que l’amiloride , utilisé à 500 µM , permet de bloquer ces canaux sans perturber la fréquence d’endocytose des cellules . J ' ai alors montré qu ' une même structure de clathrine était capable de produire plusieurs vésicules les unes à la suite des autres sans que sa fluorescence ne soit modifiée . Le temps moyen entre 2 évènements d ' endocytose à un même puits de clathrine est d ' environ 2 minutes . Puis j ' ai utilisé ce protocol pour 280 visualiser la cinétique d ' internalisation du R - β2A - SEP induite par stimulation de ce récepteur . Je me suis ensuite intéressée à l ' étude de l ' endocytose des R - AMPA en condition de DLT . Cependant , puisque cette internalisation nécessite l ' activation des R - NMDA et que ceux - ci sont inhibés par des solutions de faible pH , j’ai d ' abord mis au point une variante du ppH où la solution acide est remplacée par une solution de Trypan ( 5 mM ) . Ce protocole sans changement de pH permet de détecter l’endocytose de R - Tf - SEP dans les neurones aussi bien que le ppH pour une durée de 5 à 10 minutes car le Trypan peut absorber la fluorescence émise par la SEP . En utilisant cette nouvelle méthode d ' imagerie , j ' ai pu montrer que l ' augmentation de la fréquence d ' internalisation des R - AMPA induite par l ' application de NMDA était temporellement régulée telle qu ' elle n ' avait lieu que pendant la stimulation des neurones . En effet , l ' endocytose des R - AMPA revient à un niveau basal quelques minutes après stimulation malgré le maintien de la diminution de la force de la transmission synaptique . En revanche , j ' ai trouvé que les synapses ne représentent pas des sites d ' internalisation préférentiels pour ces récepteurs . Cela suggère donc que l ' endocytose n ' est pas spatialement régulée aux environs des synapses bien que celles - ci soient enrichies en marqueurs de l ' endocytose tels que la clathrine . Conclusion et Perspectives : Ces travaux montrent qu ' il est maintenant possible de visualiser l ' activité des zones de clathrine postsynaptiques avec une grande résolution spatiale et temporelle . Celà ouvre donc la voie à une compréhension détaillée des mécanismes moléculaires régulant l ' endocytose basale et induite des R - AMPA . D . 3 . Vers le développement d ' un inhibiteur de l ' endocytose photoactivable Article en préparation en anglais p . 188 à p . 226 Contexte : La formation de vésicules d ' endocytose est étroitement régulée par un réseau complexe d ' interactions protéines - protéines . Parmis ces protéines , il est bien établi que la GTPase dynamine joue un rôle particulièrement important puisqu ' elle génère la scission membranaire résultant en la formation d ' une vésicule d ' endocytose à partir de la mambrane plasmique . Si le recrutmeent de la dynamine est perturbé , cela induit un arrêt des puits d ' endocytose à une étape fortement invaginée , c ' est à dire à une étape tardive dans la formation des vésicules ( Shupliakov et al . , 1997 ) . D ' un autre côté , des perturbations fonctionnelles de l ' activité enzymatique de la dynamine suggèrent que 281 celle - ci puisse réguler l ' oligomérisation de la clathrine à des étapes précoces de l ' endocytose ( Sever et al . , 2000 ) . Contribution scientifique : J ' ai cherché à développer et charactériser un bloqueur de l’endocytose photoactivable afin de perturber l’EDC de manière instantanée et locale dans des cellules vivantes . Nous proposons qu ' en étant capable de perturber le recrutement de la dynamine de manère aigüe , il sera possible de déchiffrer si sa présence est nécessaire à des étapes précoces de la formation des vésicules ou non . Afin de développer un inhibiteur de l ' endocytose efficace , nous avons synthétisé et charactérisé une librairie de peptides biomimétiques issus du domaine riche en proline de la dynamine . Nous avons travaillé à partir d ' un inhibiteur peptidique de l ' endocytose , connu sous le nom de D15 mais seulement partiellement efficace , en modifiant sa séquence , sa longueur ou sa valence . En comparant des expériences réalisées en cellules et in vitro en collaboration avec des chimistes de l ' institut , nous avons trouvé que le fait de multiplier le nombre de sites d ' interactions entre les peptides inhibiteurs et leur cible amphiphysine augmentait à la fois leur avidité pour cette protéine et leur efficacité d ' inhibition de l ' endocytose en cellules . Cette optimisation nous permet de travailler à des concentrations 10 fois moins élevées en peptide qu ' avec le D15 , ce qui sera un avantage une fois que nous aurons rendu l ' un d ' eux photoactivable . Dans cette optique , j ' ai mis en place sur notre microscope les conditions nécessaires pour combiner visualisation de l ' endocytose et photoactivation . J ' ai trouvé que l ' application d ' 1 s de lumière UV sur une cellule unique dialysée avec 4 mM de DMNPE - GTP - gammaS permet de photoactiver suffisamment de GTP - gammaS libre pour inhiber instantanément l ' endocytose . Cette inhibition est totale pendant plus de 30 s suivant l ' application de lumière UV et induit un fort recrutement de dynamine à la membrane plasmique . Conclusion et Perspectives : Ces résultats préliminaires soulignent l ' importance des interaction multimériques entre la dynamine et ses partenaires de recrutement en cellules . De plus , la photoactivation de GTPgammaS nous informe sur des aspects temporels des mécanismes moléculaires régulant la formation de vésicules d ' endocytose par la dynamine . A plus long terme , la photoactivation d ' inhibiteurs spécifiques de l ' endocytose dans un compartiment restreint tel que la synpase permettra d ' élucider la contribution de l ' EDC dans l ' établissement de la spécificité synaptique de la DLT observée dans les neurones . 282 D . 4 . Recrutement spatiotemporel de la phosphatase OCRL impliquée dans le syndrome de Lowe par la GTPase Rab35 Résumé d ' abstract soumis en anglais p . 227 à p . 230 Contexte : J ' ai participé a une collaboration avec Clothilde Cauvin , étudiante en thèse , et Arnaud Echard , directeur du laboratoire " Traffic Membranaire et Division Cellulaire " à l ' Institut Pasteur à Paris . J ' ai réalisé quelques expériences pour complémenter le travail de thèse de Clothilde Cauvin sur le recrutement de la phosphatase OCRL par la GTPase Rab35 après la formation de vésicules d ' endocytose , et son implication sur le traffic intracellulaire du récepteur cation - indépendant du mannose - 6 - phosphate suite à une dérégulation de l ' homéostasie du PIP 2 , un lipide de la membrane plasmique jouant un rôle central dans l ' EDC . Contribution scientifiqe : Ce projet a permis de disséquer la séquence temporelle de recrutement de Rab35 , OCRLb et deux régulateurs de Rab35 par rapport à la scission de vésicules d ' endocytose depuis la membrane plasmique en utilisant le protocol ppH . Nous avons transfecté des cellules HeLa avec R - Tf - SEP ou R - Tf - pHuji ainsi que Rab35 - mCherry , son effecteur OCRLb - mCherry , sa GEF activatrice DENND1A - EGFP ou sa GAP inhibitrice Epi64B - mCherry . Nous avons montré que Rab35 et OCRLb son recrutés simultanément après formation de la vésicule , et que ce pic de recrutement fait suite au recrutement de DENND1A et à la disparition de EPI64B . Conclusion et Perspectives : Ce travail montre l ' importance de nouvelles méthodes de microscopie optique telles que le ppH ou le développement de pHuji pour éucider de nouveaux réseaux d ' interactions protéines - protéines encore inconnus . 283 E . CONCLUSION ET PERSPECTIVES Le travail présenté dans cette thèse a été motivé par le besoin sans cesse renouvelé de développer de nouvelles techniques d ' imagerie à haute résolution spatiale et temporelle pour étudier la régulaion de l ' EDC . Que ce soit pour en comprendre les mécanismes moléculaires ou pour étudier son organisation spatiale dans des cellules aussi complexes que les neurones , j ' ai montré que l ' utilisation du ppH et le développement de nouvelles variantes de ce protocol a permis de nouvelles avancées . Ce protocol a l ' avantage de pouvoir différencier la présence de clathrine de la formation de vésicules d ' endocytose et suggère que de nouvelles étapes de régulation sont encore à découvrir dans ce processus . Il reste encore plusieurs limitations à contourner comme par exemple le problème de la surexpression du cargo fusionné à SEP ou pHuji . Il serait intéressant dans un futur proche de pouvoir étudier l ' endocytose de cargos endogènes sans perdre en résolution spatiale et temporelle , par exemple en regardant à l ' endocytode de ligands , d ' anticorps dirigés contre les récepteurs ou encore de récepteurs marqués à leur locus génétique endogène . Enfin , il pourrait être intéressant de combiner les trois approches développées dans la présente étude , par exemple , en visualisant simultanément l ' endocytose de 2 récetpeurs dans les neurones , ou bien en utilisant des inhibiteurs d ' endocytose photoactivables spécifiquement en pré - ou en postsynaptique . 284 A C ONCLUDING M ETAPHORE Figure 1000 : Me writting this manuscript . . . and onwards ?
