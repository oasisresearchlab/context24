ubiquitously expressed actin filament （F−actin）−binding protein that stabilizes F−actin networks and promotes actin polymerization by activating the actin− related protein 2／3（Arp2／3）complex． Overexpression of cortactin in cancer cells stimulate cell migration， invasion， and experimental metastasis；however， the underlying mechanism in cortactin involvement in tumor progression is not fully understood． Recently， a direct interaction between zonula occludens−1（ZO−1）and cortactin in epithelial cells was reported． The present study aimed to further clarify the signi− ficance of the interaction between cortactin and ZO−1 in cancer progression． Cortactin expression and localization in colorectal human cancer tissues were evaluated by immuno− histochemistry and immunofluorescence． Co−immuno− precipitation and immunofluorescence analysis revealed cortactin and ZO−1 interaction and localization in cancer cells． In our study， the localization of cortactin is a crucial marker for lymph node metastasis in colorectal cancer． We show how the localization of cortactin effects cancer development． A molecular interaction between cortactin and ZO−1 in migrating or polarized cancer cells was revealed． This is the first report to show the interaction of cortactin and ZO−1 in colorectal cancer progression． We conclude that localization of cortactin in cancer cells and interaction between ZO−1 and cortactin are crucial for cancer progression． Introduction Cortactin is an actin filament（F−actin）−binding protein that localize at the cortical regions of cells and is a pro］皿inent substrate for Src−family protein tyrosine kinases in response Correspondence to：Dr Hiroshi Hirakawa， Department of Tumor and Diagnostic Pathology， Atomic Bomb Disease Institute， Nagasaki University

product of a putative oncogene， EMS1， and has been irnplicated in both cell adhesion and cell signaling （3）．Cortactin is encoded by the Cτ7フV gene and maps to chromosome l lq13（4）． The N−ter血nal half of the protein includes the N−terminal acidic region（NTA）， the binding site f（）ractin−related protein 3（Arp3）（a component of the Arp2／3 complex）followed by 65 tandem repeats of 37 amino acids responsible for F−actin binding（5）． The C−teminal half is composed of anα一helix domain of unknown function， f（）llowed by a proline−serine−threonine−rich region（PST）and Src homo− logy 3（SH3）domain（6）． Gene amplification of Cπ2V and overexpression of cortactin have been reported in various cancers including colorectal cancer（7−11）． Cortactin binds to and potentiates the activity of A】q）2／3 （12−14），which drives the remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton （15）．Remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is essential for cell migration， cell adhesion， and cell polarization as well as for tumor cell invasion and metastasis． Indeed， cells over− expressing cortactin show enhanced cel migration and invasion （16，17）and increased metastatic potential in mice（18）． Zonula occludens−1（ZO−1）is an Factin−binding protein， containing three amino−terminal PSD95／dlg／ZO−1（PDZ） domains， followed by an SH3 domain， a guanylate kinase （GK）domain， and a proline−rich region in this order forming the N−terminus（19，20）． In polarized epithelial cells， ZO−1 exclusively localizes to a tight junction（TJ）and directly binds to claudin at the first PDZ domain（21）， occludin at the GK domain（22）， and F−actin at the C−terminal half and connects claudin to the actin cytoskeleton（22，23）． The cortactin SH3 domains have been shown to bind to the proline−rich region of ZO−1（24）． However， very little is known about the function of ZO−1／cortactin complex． In the present study， we show an association between cortactin localization in human colorectal cancer cells and lymph node metastasis． We also show interaction between ZO−1 and cortactin at TJ． The association of ZO−1 and cortactin may direct1・y play important roles in the formation and／or regulation of cell−cell adhesion and tumor progression．

ZO−1（1：250；LifeSpan Biosciences）antibodies were used． Ce〃cLtlture． LS 123（human colon cancer）cells， kindly provided by Dr T． Nakayama（Atomic Bomb Disease Institute， Nagasaki， Japan）， were grown in minimal essential medium （MEM， Gibco Invitrogen， Carlsbad， CA， USA）supplemented with penicillin／streptomycin plus lO％fetal calf serum（FCS） at 37°C in 5％CO2． Cells of 30％confluence and 100％ confluence in a 10−cm plastic dish were used for immuno− precipitation study． Cell with 70％confluency were used for immunocytochemical analysis． Immunohistochemistry． We randomly chose samples from surgical specimens that were subjected to pathological diagnoses in our institution from 2005 to 2008． Forty colo− rectal cancer cases were studied． In previous reports， cortactin expression was related to depth of invasion（10）． To reveal the association of cortactin expression with cancer cell metastasis， we randomly selected T2 stage according to the TNM classification system． All investigations were approved by our institutional review board， and informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to the study． We prepared 4−−ptm−thick sections from fomlalin−fixed， paraffin−embedded tissue blocks and subjected them to immunohistochemical analyses with an avidin−biotin complex detection system （Vectastain；Vector Laboratories， Burlingame， CA， USA）． To facilitate antigen retrieval， the sections were incubated in Tris−ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid（EDTA）buffer（pH 9．0） at 121℃for 15 min． Images were captured with a Nikon Digital Sight Fi l camera（Nikon， Tokyo， Japan）． A diamino− benzidine（DAB）kit（Histofine；Nichirei， Tokyo， Japan）was used for the detection of immunoreactions． The control sections were incubated with isotype−matched immuno− globulin（Ig）G． 0．1％Nonidet P−40， and l tablet of Complete protease inhibitor cocktail（Roche Diagnostics， Indianapolis， IN）and incubated on ice fbr 30 min． Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15，000rpm for 20 min． The supernatant was precleared by incubating with Protein A／G PIus Agarose beads（Thermo Scientific）for l h at 4℃． Four hundred microliters（200μg of total protein）of precleared extracts were incubated with 2−5μlof

immuno− precipitates were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate−poly− acrylamide gel electrophoresis（SDS−PAGE）and the proteins were then transferred to lmmobilon−P membranes（Millipore， Billerica， MA， USA）． The membranes were blocked with 5％non−fat dry milk in phosphate−buffered saline（PBS） contailling O．05％Tween−20 and then incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti−ZO−1 antibody（1：100）， anti−B−catenin（1／500） or anti−cortactin antibody（1：100）． Reactivity was detected by the using horseradish peroxidase−conjugated secondary antibodies and chemiluminescence（ECL， Amersham Pharma−

with O．25％Triton X−100， and processed for immunofluorescence analysis as described below． 肋ηz朋（Z伽orescence analysiぷ． After incubation with primary antibodies， the sections were further incubated with secondary antibodies（Alexa 488 conjugated affinipure goat anti−mouse IgG and Alexa 555 cor巾gated affinipure goat anti−rabbit IgG）obtained from Molecular Probes（Eugene， OR， USA）． Slides were then mounted with Vectashield mounting medium containing 4，6−diamidino−2−phenylindole（DAPI）nuclear counterstain（Vector Laboratories）． The fluorescence images were examined using an MD2500 microscope（Leica Micro− systems， Tokyo， Japan）with x40 and x 1000bjective lens． The pictures were captured with a Leica DC500 camera（Leica Microsystems）． iηmunoprecipitation analysis． Cells were incubated in ice−cold lysis buffer consisting 50 mM Tris−Cl（pH 7．6），150 mM NaCl， Localization of cortactin in normal colon epithe伽m and colorectal cαncer． Immunoreactivity of cortactin was found at the apical border of normal colon epithelium where it colocalized with ZO−1． In colorectal cancer， the localization of cortactin was often separated from ZO−1． In cancer cells， immunoreactivity of cortactin was not only found at the apical region but also often observed at the cell periphery（Fig．1）． Locαljzα加η〈ゾZO−1 and E−cadherin． Apical localization of ZO−1（Fig．2A）and basolateral localization of E−cadherin

cells． Higher interactioll of ZO−1 and cortactin was also found in 100％confluent cells and lower interaction of these molecules in 30％confluent cells． In contrast， lower interaction of ZO−l and B−catenin was found in 100％confluent cells and lower interaction of these molecules was obtained in 30％confluent cells． In this study， we were not able to co−immunoprecipitate cortactin and B−catenin（Fig．4）． Immunocytochemistry． Immunocytochemistry studies were conducted to reveal the underlying mechanisms involved in the difference between the interaction of ZO−1／cortactin and ZO−1／B−catenin within 30％confluent cells and 100％ confluent cells． In migrating cells， cortactin was fbund at the leading edge of cancer cells． In polarized cells， which had TJ， cortactin was observed at cell−cell junction． Double immunofluorescence study showed colocalization of ZO−l and cortactin at the TJ． Colocalization of ZO−l and B−catellill was fbund at primordial cell−cell junction， where tight junction protein occludin was not obtained（Fig．5）． Discussion of colorectal cancer is consistent with previous findings． Furtheimore， the present results indicate that the overexpression of cortactin and the locaUzation of cortactin complex are critical factors for progression of cancer． Cancer metastasis involves a series of events that include dissociation of malignant cells from a primary site， migration， intravasation into circulatory system， and adhesion to the vascular endothelium followed by extravasation， invasion， and growth at distant sites（26）． It is possible that polarization and depolarization of cancer cells often occur in cancer progression． Thus， in this study， we analyzed 30％confluent cells， which are considered as migrating， and 100％confluent cells， which are considered as polarized growth． In initial stages during the formation of cell−cell junctions of epithelial cells， primordial spot−1ike cell−cell junction is first formed at the tips of the cellular protrusions radiating from adjacent cells（27−30）． Cadherin and ZO−l colocalize to the primordial junction where occludin is not concentrated（28）． As cellular polarization proceeds， occludin gradually accumulates at the spot−1ike junction to form TJ， and cadherin is sorted from occludin and ZO−1 from adherence junction． Consistent with these studies， we found ZO−1 and B−catenin at primordial cell−cell junction． In polarized cells， that were observed in 100％con刊uence， cortactin was localized at the cell−cell junction with ZO−1．These results are consistent with previous studies（24β1）． Based on these findings we propose that dissociation of ZO−1 and cortactin in cancer cells is critical fOr cancer cell rrligration． ZO−1 accumulation at the leading edge of migrating cells was not observed in the present experiments． In contrast to these results， several investigators have reported the existence of ZO−1 in the leading edge of fibroblasts migrating in a wound alld cancer cells， where it has been suggested to initiate integrin−dependent adhesion complexes（32，33）． Further studies are needed to clarify the role of ZO−1 in cancer cell adhesion and rnigration． In conclusion， the present results showed an association between the localization of cortactin and cancer development． In our previous study， we reported the association between loss of polarity and cancer cell development（25）． Together， these findings indicate that the loss of cell−cell adhesion and cell polarity， which is commonly observed in advanced cancer， may be directly involved in cell signaling． Further studies are needed oll cell adhesion and signaling fbr cancer development， In this study， we demonstrated that the localization of cortactin at cell periphery was significantly associated with lymph node involvement． We evaluated whether cortactin effects the development of colorectal cancer． Results indicate that the association of ZO−1 and cortactin plays an important role in regulating cell adhesion and spreading． ZO−l is a component of cell−cell junction and is thought to work in a structural linkage between cell−cell junctions and cytoskeletal networks（21−23）． Cortactin also has an F−actin cross−1inking activity and has been implicated in cytoskeleton reorganization（12−14）． Cortactin overexpression is known to be associated with the development of cancer（7−11）． The overexpression of cortactin obtained by immunohistoche血stry in 62．5％cases References 1．Wu H， Reynolds AB， Kanner SB， Vines RR and Parsons JT： Identification and characterization of a
