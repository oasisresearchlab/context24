Immunohistochemical staining showed that ERK and ezrin expressions were signi ﬁ cantly higher in invasive squamous cell carcinoma than in carcinoma in situ . To investigate the roles of ERK and ezrin in cancer development , we used the non - woven silica ﬁ bre sheet Cellbed TM with a structure resembling the loose connective tissue morphology in a novel 3D culture system . We con ﬁ rmed that the 3D system using Cellbed TM accurately mimicked cancer cell morphology in vivo . Furthermore , cell projections were much more apparent in 3D - cultured tongue cancer cell lines than in 2D cultures . Typically , under conventional 2D culture conditions , F - actin and cortactin are colocalized in the form of puncta within cells . However , in the 3D - cultured cells , colocalization was mainly observed at the cell margins , including the projections . Projections containing F - actin and cortactin colocalization were predicted to be invadopodia . Although suppressing ezrin expression with small interfering RNA transfection caused no marked changes in morphology , cell projection formation was decreased , and the tumour thickness in vertical sections after 3D culture was markedly decreased after suppressing ERK activity because both the invasion ability and proliferation were inhibited . An association between cortactin activation as well as ERK activity and invadopodia formation was detected . Our novel 3D culture systems using Cellbed ™ are simple and useful for in vitro studies before conducting animal experiments . ERK contributes to tongue cancer development by increasing both cancer cell proliferation and migration via cortactin activation . International Journal of Oral Science ( 2018 ) 10 : 30 ; https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41368 - 018 - 0033 - y INTRODUCTION Oral cancer ranks 15th worldwide in both morbidity and mortality . 1 , 2 In Japan , the number of patients with oral cancer has been increasing each year ; oral cancer develops most frequently in the tongue . 3 To improve the prognosis of advanced tongue cancer , it is necessary to determine the molecular mechanisms associated with its development and develop new targeted treatments . We previously reported that ezrin contributes to the development of tongue cancer , suggesting its usefulness as a novel therapeutic target . 4 To screen for additional treatment targets , we ﬁ rst evaluated the possible contributions of extra - cellular signal - related kinase ( ERK ) and AKT to the development of tongue cancer by immunohistochemical analyses . We found that ERK and ezrin were signi ﬁ cantly overexpressed in invasive squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) compared to carcinoma in situ ( CIS ) . Although it has been reported that AKT is associated with the progression of tongue cancer , AKT staining showed no signi ﬁ cant difference in the degree of protein expression between CIS and SCC samples in our study . These results suggest that both ERK and ezrin contribute to the development of tongue cancer . Most studies in the ﬁ eld of cancer research have been carried out with two - dimensional ( 2D ) cultures in in vitro experimental systems using cancer cell lines ; however , the 2D culture environment on the surface of hard tissue culture plates composed of polystyrene or glass considerably differs from the microenvironment within the body for basic activities . 5 – 8 There - fore , experimental systems using 2D culture may not accurately reproduce the physiological effects of cancer cells in vivo . 9 When cells isolated from tissues are subjected to 2D culture on a planar culture support , many cells become progressively ﬂ atter , divide abnormally , and lose their differentiated phenotype . 10 , 11 Recently , increased attention has been given to mimicking the environment surrounding tumour cells in vivo , which is characterized by the abnormal accumulation of extracellular matrix components or key enzymes , the development of abnormal angiogenesis , and the incorporation of heterogeneous cell populations to investigate the physiological actions of tumour cells . In the current study , a novel 3D culture support composed of a ﬁ ne non - woven silica ﬁ bre sheet was used as a scaffold . Cells cultured in this system with the silica ﬁ bre scaffold developed a 3D con ﬁ guration more closely resembling cells , and thus accurately mimicking the morphology of tumour cells in vivo and promoting cell growth . 12 We recently found that the shape of a Cellbed TM resembles loose connective Received : 22 August 2017 Revised : 8 August 2018 Accepted : 16 August 2018 1 Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery , Shiga University of Medical Science , Ō tsu , Shiga , Japan ; 2 Department of Pathology , Division of Molecular Diagnostic Pathology , Shiga University of Medical Science , Ō tsu , Shiga , Japan and 3 Dental Oral Surgery , Nagahama Red Cross Hospital , Nagahama , Shiga , Japan Correspondence : K . - I .

We suppressed the expression of ezrin and ERK and evaluated the changes in cancer cell behaviour and morphology , particularly invadopodia formation , by culturing tongue cancer cell lines in a novel 3D system using Cellbed TM . RESULTS Screening of target proteins Protein expression in human tongue tumour tissue . The results of staining with each antibody are shown in Table 1 . Staining for ezrin protein showed a high expression level in two cases and a low level in ten cases for CIS samples , as well as a high level in 12 cases and low level in one case for SCC samples ( P = 0 . 0002 ) . Staining for the ERK protein showed a high expression level in one case and a low level in 11 cases for CIS samples , but a high level in 11 cases and low level in two cases for SCC samples ( P = 0 . 0002 ) . Staining for the AKT protein showed a high expression level in one case and a low level in 11 cases for CIS samples , as well as a high level in six cases and a low level in seven cases for SCC samples . Thus , AKT staining showed no signi ﬁ cant difference in the degree of protein expression between CIS and SCC samples ( P = 0 . 073 ) . The number of samples showing high expression levels of ezrin and ERK was signi ﬁ cantly greater for SCC than for CIS . Fig . 1 shows the representative images of ezrin and ERK staining for CIS and SCC samples . The intensity of both the proteins of ezrin and ERK was signi ﬁ cantly higher in SCC samples than in CIS samples . Veri ﬁ cation of a novel 3D culture system using Cellbed 3D culture using a non - woven silica ﬁ bre sheet ( Cellbed ) . We compared the morphology of 3D - and 2D - cultured cells for HSC - 3 and HSC - 4 cell lines by haematoxylin and eosin ( HE ) staining . The 2D - cultured HSC - 3 and HSC - 4 cells appeared rounded . However , we easily detected cell projections in 3D - cultured HSC - 3 and HSC - 4 cells ( Fig . 2a ) . We con ﬁ rmed cell growth by MTT assay under both 2D and 3D culture conditions ( Fig . 2b ) . In HSC - 4 cells that had been 3D - cultured for a long period of approximately 4 weeks , abnormal keratinization of SCC was observed in the horizontal sectional images of specimens prepared parallel to the Cellbed ( Fig . 3a ) . A layered structure of squamous epithelial cells was also observed in the vertical cross - sectional images of toluidine blue staining ( Fig . 3b ) . Electron microscopy images of the veri ﬁ cation of HSC - 4 cells 3D - cultured for approximately 4 weeks also revealed structures that were found scattered over the lateral surface of epithelial cells . The structures have the characteristics of desmosomal attachments between cells ( Fig . 3c ) . These ﬁ ndings demonstrated that the morphology of cells cultured using Cellbed was similar to their in vivo 3D structure . The roles of ERK and ezrin in cancer development Evaluation of invasive capacity in 3D culture : a study of vertical sections . HE specimens were prepared from 3D - cultured HSC - 4 cells given ERK inhibitor ( FR180204 ) in the sections vertical to the Cellbed and were observed . The results showed that both untreated control cells ( HSC - 4C ) and cells administered FR180204 ( HSC - 4FR ) formed a layered structure based on squamous epithelial cells . We measured the width of in ﬁ ltration of cancer cells in the vertical section as an index of invasion ability . We found that the layer thickness was thinner for HSC - 4FR cells than for HSC - 4C cells ( Fig . 4 ) . Additionally , we performed immunohistochemical staining of Ki67 and compared the Ki67 - labelling index between FR and control cells . The Ki - 67 index was much higher in control cells than in the FR cells ( Fig . 4 ) . These Table 1 .

Morphological changes in cancer cells following ezrin and ERK inhibition . The effect of ezrin small interfering RNA ( siRNA ) and administration of ERK inhibitor ( FR180204 ) on 3D - cultured HSC - 3 and HSC - 4 cells was evaluated by western blotting by detecting the ezrin and phosphorylation - ERK ( p - ERK ) protein levels ( Fig . 5 ) . In both 3D - cultured HSC - 3 and HSC - 4 cells , the cytoskeleton was visualized by the immuno ﬂ uorescent staining of F - actin after transfection with ezrin siRNA and treatment with ERK inhibitor . The results showed that the formation of cell projections was inhibited in FR cells compared to control cells , with a change in morphology to a rounded cobblestone shape , but no marked differences were observed in siEzrin cells ( Fig . 6 ) . Relationship between ERK and cortactin in the regulation of cell morphology . We suspected that an association between ERK and the actin control protein , cortactin , was a causal factor in the changes in cell morphology due to the administration of ERK inhibitor ( FR180204 ) . To investigate the association between ERK and cortactin , changes in the expression levels of cortactin and p - cortactin ( Tyr421 ) after the administration of FR180204 were investigated by western blotting . The results showed that in both 3D - cultured HSC - 3 and HSC - 4 cells , there were no changes in cortactin and p - cortactin ( Tyr421 ) levels in siEzrin cells compared to non - silencing control cells ( Fig . 5a ) , but the expression of p - cortactin was suppressed in 3D - cultured FR cells compared to control cells ( Fig . 5b ) . Evaluation of cancer cell invadopodia in the 3D culture environment . Morphological changes in 3D - cultured tongue cancer cells ( HSC - 3 and HSC - 4 ) following the administration of ERK inhibitor ( FR180204 ) were evaluated by immuno ﬂ uorescence staining , particularly to determine the sites of F - actin and cortactin colocalization . Ordinarily , under conventional 2D culture condi - tions , F - actin and cortactin are colocalized in the form of puncta within the cells ( Fig . 7a ) . However , in 3D - cultured control cells , colocalization was mainly observed at the cell margins and was particularly noticeable ( Fig . 7b , c ) . Moreover , cell projection formation was decreased by the administration of ERK inhibitor ( FR180204 ) , and colocalization was noted in a circle around the cytoskeleton . Based on these results , the projections in HSC - 3 and HSC - 4 cells observed in the 3D culture environment were predicted to be invadopodia .

Silver impregnation staining of human tongue tissue in this study revealed that the morphology of Cellbed resembles that of loose connective tissue with irregularly arranged collagen and reticular ﬁ bres . The mean ﬂ ow pore diameter of Cellbed measured by the bubble point method on the horizontal surface of a single sheet was 7 μ m – 8 μ m , but the pore diameter may be slightly wider in the actual 3D con ﬁ guration . The normal size of a cell nucleus is approximately 3 μ m – 10 μ m , while in cancer cells , the nucleus may be larger than 10 μ m . In connective tissue in vivo , cancer cells are thought to proliferate and invade using collagen ﬁ bres as a scaffold or skeleton . 20 In this study , vertical cross - sectional images of long - term 3D - cultured HSC - 4 cells revealed that the squamous epithelium had a layered structure and differentiation towards the surface layer was con ﬁ rmed . Abnormal keratinization of squamous epithelial carcinoma was also observed . Moreover , vertically oriented desmosomes were detected by electron microscopy .

The Cellbed 3D culture system shows advantages in cancer research compared to other 3D culture systems . Various 3D culture systems have been developed , including standard 3D Matrigel culture , scaffolds using collagen or hyaluronic acid , 21 , 22 and synthetic poly ( lactide - co - glycolide ) , as well as methods employing cells - in - gels - in - paper 23 , 24 or a micro ﬂ uidic - based 3D culture device . 17 Although currently widely used , Matrigel is derived from animals or cultured cells , and the quantity of the soluble structural components changes during experiments , decreasing the experimental reproducibility and reliability . 25 The application of other systems is limited because of dif ﬁ culties in reproducing 3D culture and controlling the 3D structure ; 26 the culture method is complex and the long - term culture or extraction of constituents such as proteins is dif ﬁ cult . In contrast , the Cellbed culture method is simple ; it is conducted in a conventional culture plate and long - term culture for approximately 4 weeks and protein extraction is possible . Moreover , Cellbed can be cut after cell culture and used in other experiments . Thus , Cellbed is useful as a 3D culture support because it can be used in experiments that are dif ﬁ cult to perform using other 3D culture systems . ERK is a downstream component of the signalling module activated by Raf serine / threonine kinase . In cancer , it causes the abnormal activation of ERK / mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signalling following upstream activation , particularly by epidermal growth factor receptor and Ras GTPases ( small guanosine triphosphatases ) , and promotes the proliferation and survival of cancer cells and metastasis . 27 Although Theocaris et al . reported that the detection of total - ERK ( t - ERK ) and p - ERK1 / 2 expression in in ﬁ ltrating lymphoid cells of mobile tongue cancer is much more informative than measuring their expression in cancer cells , 28 Degen et al . found that ERK plays an important role in the oral epithelium prior to tumour invasion ; 29 our results are consistent with these ﬁ ndings . To examine the roles of ERK in invadopodia formation associated with cancer development , we administered the ERK inhibitor FR180204 to HSC - 3 and HSC - 4 cells in both the 2D and 3D culture systems . Under 2D culture conditions , the colocalization of cortactin and F - actin was previously reported to be observed in the form of puncta within cells . However , in the present study using 3D culture , colocaliza - tion was strong at the margins of cell projections . Furthermore , the ERK inhibitor decreased cell projection formation and altered the cell morphology . Although we did not examine whether the projections can degrade the extracellular matrix , the present results suggest that in vivo invadopodia are present within the cell projections , which contributes to cancer invasion , rather than in the form of puncta in the cytoplasm , as observed under 2D culture conditions . Cortactin is an F - actin - binding protein localized in the cell margin where actin reconstruction occurs , which is necessary for cell migration in the basal state . It is thought to act as a link between the cytoplasm and nucleus . 30 ERK is known to be associated with cortactin activation 31 , 32 and has been reported to be associated with the phosphorylation of S405 and S418 in cortactin . 33 , 34 In the present study , analysis of cortactin phosphorylation at Tyr421 revealed the greater suppression of p - cortactin ( Tyr421 ) in FR cells than in control cells . No previous studies have reported the relationship between ERK and Tyr421 and the details remain unclear ; however , based on the results of the present study , p - cortactin ( Tyr421 ) is associated with the formation of cell projections as well as ERK and cortactin signalling , which activates Tyr421 . In summary , our results suggest that cortactin is activated by p - ERK and contributes to invadopodia formation and tongue cancer development based on experiments performed in a novel 3D culture system using Cellbed . Thus , experimental 3D culture systems using Cellbed are simple and useful for in vitro studies Control Control HE Ki - 67 Ki - 67 FR180204 ( 50 μ m ) FR180204 ( 50 μ m ) HE 50 μ m 50 μ m 50 μ m 50 μ m Fig . 4 Forty - eight hours after HSC - 4 cells were seeded into a 12 - well plate , the medium was replaced with medium containing FR180204 ( 50 μ mol (cid:129) L − 1 ) .

MATERIALS AND METHODS Screening of target proteins Human tongue cancer tissue . Formalin - ﬁ xed paraf ﬁ n embedded block specimens of CIS ( 12 cases ) and invasive SCC of the tongue ( T1 : ten cases , T2 : three cases ) , surgically removed at the Shiga University of Medical Science hospital , were examined in this study . This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the hospital ( Approval No . 27 - 78 ) . Immunohistochemical staining of human tongue cancer tissue . To screen for the target proteins , we ﬁ rst evaluated the possible contributions of ezrin , ERK and AKT by the immunohistological staining of human tongue cancer tissues . Three - micrometre - thick sequential sections were prepared from the paraf ﬁ n blocks of the maximum cut surface specimens for each case . The intensity of staining was classi ﬁ ed on a four - point scale : 0 , 1 + , 2 + , 3 + , with 0 and 1 + , indicating low levels and 2 + and 3 + , indicating high levels . The degree of staining was compared between CIS and SCC samples . The antibodies used were as follows : anti - ezrin rabbit antibody ( 1 : 100 , # 3145 ; Cell Signalling Technology , Danvers , MA , USA ) , anti - p44 / 42 MAPK mouse antibody ( 1 : 500 , # 4696 ; Cell Signalling Technology ) anti - AKT mouse antibody ( 1 : 250 , # 2920 ; Cell Signalling Technology ) . Immunostaining was carried out using a Discovery XT Automated IHC Stainer with a Ventana DABMap Detection Kit ( No . 760 – 124 ; Ventana Medical System , Oro Valley , AZ , USA ) . Each step of the Ventana DABMap Detection Kit procedure was optimized for the Discovery XT instrument ; the conditions , such as the dilutions of each antibody , were established before the measurements . In all cases , the antigen was activated by heating . Fisher ’ s exact test was used for statistical analysis , and the level of signi ﬁ cance was P < 0 . 05 . Veri ﬁ cation of a novel 3D culture system using Cellbed Characteristics of non - woven silica ﬁ bre sheet ( Cellbed ) . In this study , a non - woven silica ﬁ bre sheet ( Cellbed ) was used as the 3D culture support . Cellbed was supplied by Japan Vilene Co . , Tokyo , Japan . Cellbed is a ﬁ bre aggregate produced by consolidating continuously produced silica ﬁ bres in a sheet form , forming an ultra ﬁ ne non - woven silica glass ﬁ bre sheet ( 200 μ m thick ) . The average thickness of the silica ﬁ bres was approximately 1 μ m , and the mean ﬂ ow pore diameter measured by the bubble point test was 7 μ m – 8 μ m . Cellbed is opaque in air ; therefore , it is dif ﬁ cult to observe the cells during cell culture . However , after staining , the cells can be observed using a mounting medium with the same refractive index ( 1 . 46 ) as the silica ﬁ bres ( Fig . 8a , b ) . Cell culture . In the 3D cell culture system , we spread Cellbed on dishes or well plates and cultured the cells on it . The other conditions were mostly the same between the 2D and 3D culture system . However , we could prolong the duration of cell culture in the 3D culture system for up to 4 weeks . Two tongue cancer cell lines , HSC - 3 and HSC - 4 , were purchased from the JCRB Cell Bank ( Tokyo , Japan ) . The culture medium used was Dulbecco ’ s modi ﬁ ed Eagle ’ s medium ( Nacalai Tesque , Kyoto , Japan ) containing 10 % foetal bovine serum ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) and 1 % antibiotic - antimycotic solution ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) . Cell culture was carried out at 37 °C in the presence of 5 % CO 2 . HE staining . Seventy - two hours after seeding the cells ( HSC - 3 and HSC - 4 : 1× 10 5 cells per mL ) into a 12 - well plate on glass coverslips and Cellbed , the cells were washed with phosphate buffered saline ( PBS ) and then ﬁ xed for 30 min in PBS containing 10 % formalin . Cell lines cultured on Cellbed were embedded in paraf ﬁ n . Serial 5 - μ m sections were histologically evaluated by HE staining . Cells cultured on glass coverslips were stained with HE without being embedded in paraf ﬁ n . Cell growth assay . The MTT assay was used to evaluate the proliferation and growth of 2D - and 3D - cultured cells . The experiment was repeated three times . Cells were seeded in 96 - well plates ( 2D - cultured HSC - 3 and HSC - 4 : 1 × 10 4 cells per mL ) , and MTT solution ( 0 . 25 mg • mL - 1 ) was added to the medium after incubation for 48 , 72 or 96 h . Formazan crystals were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide , and the absorption was measured at 570 nm using an In ﬁ nite 200 microplate reader ( TECAN , Kawasaki , Japan ) .

Immunohistochemical staining of HSC - 4 cells cultured on Cellbed . Cells cultured on Cellbed were embedded in paraf ﬁ n . Serial 5 - μ m sections were histologically evaluated by Ki - 67 staining . HSC - 4 cells cultured on Cellbed were stained in the same manner as the human tongue cancer tissue . Immunohistochemical staining was performed using an anti - Ki67 rabbit monoclonal antibody ( cat . # ab16667 ; Abcam plc , Cambridge , UK ) . Toluidine blue staining and electron microscopy of HSC - 4 cells 3D - cultured for approximately 4 weeks . The sample used was HSC - 4 cells cultured on Cellbed for approximately 4 weeks . Cell culture was performed in a 96 - well plate ; during the 4 - week culture period , the size of the container was gradually increased to supply the cells with an adequate quantity of culture medium . At the end of the cultures , culture was carried out in a 16 - cm dish . Samples were prepared for imaging by Tokai Electron Micro - scopy Inc . ( Nagoya , Japan ) . The samples were ﬁ xed with 2 % paraformaldehyde and 2 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 mol • L - 1 phos - phate buffer ( PB ; pH 7 . 4 ) . Thereafter , they were ﬁ xed with 2 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 mol • L - 1 PB at 4 °C overnight . The samples were post - ﬁ xed with 2 % osmium tetroxide in 0 . 1 mol • L - 1 PB at 4 °C for 90 min . Furthermore , the samples were in ﬁ ltrated with propylene oxide ( PO ) two times for 20 min each and then placed into a 70 : 30 mixture of PO and resin ( Quetol - 812 ; Nissin EM Co . , Tokyo , Japan ) for 1 h . The cap of the tube was kept open , and PO was volatilized overnight . The polymerized resins were cut into semithin sections of 1 . 5 μ m with glass knives using an ultra - microtome ( Ultracut UCT ; Leica , Vienna , Austria ) and stained with 0 . 5 % toluidine blue . The polymerized resins were cut into ultrathin sections of 70 nm with a diamond knife using an ultramicrotome DAPI F - actin Cortactin Marge HSC - 3 C on t r o l C on t r o l F R c e ll F R c e ll HSC - 3 HSC - 4 HSC - 4 a b c Fig . 7 Immuno ﬂ uorescent staining of 2D and 3D - cultured tongue cell lines . a Immuno ﬂ uorescent staining was carried out on HSC - 3 cells after 2D culture for 2 days on a glass coverslip .

The roles of ERK and ezrin in cancer development Ezrin siRNA . Ezrin siRNA ( 5 ′ - CCCUUGGACUGAAUAUUUAUGAG AA - 3 ′ ) and a non - silencing control siRNA were purchased from Invitrogen . Following the manufacturer ’ s protocol , 48 h after seeding the cells ( HSC - 3 and HSC - 4 : 1 × 10 5 cells per mL ) into a 12 - well plate , the cells were transfected using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent ( Invitrogen ) . Transfected cells were designated as siEzrin cells . ERK inhibitor . The ERK inhibitor used was FR180204 ( Merck CalBiochem , Darmstadt , Germany ) . Forty - eight hours after seeding the cells ( HSC - 3 and HSC - 4 : 10 × 10 4 cells per mL ) into a 12 - well plate , the culture medium was replaced with medium containing FR180204 ( 30 or 50 μ mol • L - 1 ) . Six hours after replacing the culture medium , the protein was recovered for western blotting . Cells cultured in the presence of ERK inhibitor were designated as FR cells . Western blotting . The experiment was repeated three times . The Cellbed was ﬂ ushed ( 9 100 g , 4 °C ) to remove moisture after washing with PBS , was then immersed in lysis buffer [ 50 mmol • L - 1 Tris – HCl ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 150 mmol • L - 1 sodium chloride , 0 . 5 mmol • L - 1 EDTA , 0 . 09 U • mL - 1 aprotinin , 1 mg • mL - 1 pepstatin , 10 mmol • L - 1 phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂ uoride and 1 mg • mL - 1 leupeptin ] , and incubated for 30 min on ice . The Cellbed and lysis buffer were then transferred to a spin column and centrifuged ( 13 000 g , 4 °C , 10 min ) . The protein concentration of the lysate collected in the centrifuge tube was measured by the BCA assay . The protein lysate ( 5 μ g per lane ) was separated on a 4 % – 12 % sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel ( NuPAGE , Invitrogen ) and then trans - ferred onto a poly ( vinylidene di ﬂ uoride ) membrane ( Invitrogen ) . Before incubation with primary antibodies , the ﬁ lm was blocked with TBS - T [ 20 mmol • L - 1 Tris – HCl ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 8 g • L - 1 sodium chloride , and 0 . 1 % Tween 20 ] containing 4 % dried skim milk .
