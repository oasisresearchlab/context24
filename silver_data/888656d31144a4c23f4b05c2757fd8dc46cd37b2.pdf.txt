The " Active Search " Hypothesis : How Search Strategies Relate to Creative Learning Srishti Palani , Zijian Ding , Stephen MacNeil , Steven P . Dow Universits of California , San Diego , USA { srishti , zding , smacneil , spdow } @ ucsd . edu ABSTRACT While research shows that web search plays a role throughout the creative process , less is known about about how people use web search to learn and frame their thinking about an open problem . People need web search to gather information about a problem area , but this can also influence the rest of the creative process . To understand how web search affects early - stage design , we collected and analyzed search log and self - report data from 34 students in a project - based design class . Participants reported struggling with scoping broad , ill - defined information goals into queries , learning domain - specific language , and assessing the usefulness of informa - tion . Analysis found that more active and diverse search behavior ( i . e . issuing more frequent and diverse queries , and opening more webpages ) related to more progress in early - stage design ( i . e . gath - ering more facts , articulating more insights , and developing better problem frames ) . Based on these findings , we discuss implications for designing search tools to support peoples‚Äô creative processes .

This process of gathering information and discovering insights can have a significant impact on how designers approach or " frame " a problem [ 11 , 23 , 31 ] .

Based on a recent diary and survey study [ 41 ] , researchers have found that people search to support a range of creative tasks across different domains , such as academic writ - ing , cooking , design ( e . g . visual , architectural , etc . ) [ 20 , 26 , 39 , 40 ] . Searchers use specific information resources ( e . g . images , videos ) strategically to support different stages of the creative process [ 41 ] . However , less is known about how specific web search behaviors in - fluence early - stage design and problem framing . This paper builds on prior self - report studies to understand how search behavior relates to learning and problem framing , by gathering search log data to observe in - situ search behavior and survey data to gain qualitative insight into the meaning of quantitative results . Prior work , by the Search - as - Learning community , has developed tasks [ 21 , 38 ] and measures [ 3 , 37 ] using the cognitive learning dimension of Anderson and Krathwohl‚Äôs Taxonomy of Learning [ 24 ] a well - known education resource . In this taxonomy , six types of cognitive processes are identified : remember , understand , apply , analyze , evaluate and create . Early stages of a design process require the designer to learn about a new domain , and involve all these types of learning : from recalling facts ( remember ) to synthesizing information to discover insights ( understand , analyze , evaluate ) , and asking questions and posing problems in a fruitful and radical ways , generating ideas ( create ) , etc . [ 9 , 10 , 27 , 31 ] . Rieh et al . [ 28 ] conceptualizes this comprehensive task as " creative learning " . While there has been some prior work [ 16 , 22 , 38 ] to understand the relationship between search behavior and learning outcomes , these studies focus on learning rather than creative tasks . This paper builds on this prior work to investigate the following research questions : RQ1 : What does search log and self - report data reveal about the information goals , challenges experienced and strategies employed by searchers during early - stage design ? RQ2 : How do web search behaviors relate to creative learning outcomes ( such as gathering facts , discovering of insights , and framing the problem ) ? To address these research questions , we observed 34 students in a project - based design classroom as they searched the web for 30 minutes during their early - stage design process . Our analysis of search log data , together with participants‚Äô self - reports about their experiences found that : participants have cognitively - complex information goals ‚Äì for example , to understand domain - specific language and context , to find patterns and design constraints , and seek inspiration to generate ideas . Participants reported challenges with scoping broad , ill - defined information needs into queries , and assessing the usefulness of information .

Based on these findings , we discuss implications for designing search tools to better support peoples‚Äô creative learning process . 2 METHOD 2 . 1 Participants 34 undergraduate students from a project - based design course were recruited , and received 1 % extra course credit for their participation . The study was conducted over a period of the first two days in the first week of classes . Participants had a diverse range of prior design experience ( ùúá = 2 . 19 , ùúé = 1 . 07 ) . Participants had only a little prior knowledge about the topic ( ùúá = 1 . 38 , ùúé = 0 . 72 , on a scale of 1 = no knowledge at all , 5 = know a lot ) All participants reported extensive prior experience with web search , in general everyone reported searching multiple times a day , and using web search for more than five years . 32 of them reported using Google , and 2 using Bing and Baidu as their primary search engine . All of them used Google Chrome as their primary search browser 2 . 2 Procedure At the start of the study , the researcher explained the study pro - cedure and guided participants through how to install and use a Chrome browser plugin ( https : / / tinyurl . com / HistoryMaster ) to col - lect search logs . All search log data was automatically anonymized uponcollection . Apre - tasksurveycapturedparticipants‚Äôwebsearch experience , prior design experience , prior domain knowledge , and information seeking goals . As the main task , participants had 30 minutes to search and take notes on one of four topics being studied in a project - based design course ( Refer to Supplementary Materials at https : / / tinyurl . com / SearchTasks for Search Tasks ) . The breadth and depth of these four multi - faceted topics provides a good oppor - tunity to study web search in the context of early - stage design . Before and after the task , participants were required to summa - rize what they knew about the topic in 3 - 5 sentences or 200 - words , and write a problem statement that could be the focus of a quarter - long project . Additionally , in the post - task survey students were asked to report any challenges faced and strategies used when using web search during this early - stage exploratory creative design task . The study lasted 60 minutes : 30 for web search and 30 minutes for filling out the pre - and post - task surveys . 2 . 3 Measures 2 . 3 . 1 Qualitative Insights from Surveys . Survey questions about in - formation seeking goals , challenges faced and strategies used were analyzed using a grounded - theory approach to thematic analysis . 2 . 3 . 2 Web Search Logs . To understand search behavior , from the search logs we calculated the following measures for each partici - pant : ( i ) Number of queries issued ; ( ii ) Length of query ( i . e . average number of terms per query ) ; ( iii ) Diversity of query ( i . e . number of unique query terms , stemmed to reduce the query terms to their respective base forms without affixes ) ; ( iv ) Number of unique web pages opened . 2 . 3 . 3 Creative Learning Metrics . To measure creative learning out - comes , we calculated the following measures for each participant : Metric Defintion Fleiss‚ÄôKappa QualityofFacts ( Understand ) Usefulness of recalled facts ( 0 - 3 , where 0 : irrelevant or useless facts , 3 : facts demonstrate technical understanding ) 0 . 64 InterpretationofFacts ( Analyze ) Synthesis of facts to draw conclusions ( 0 - 2 , where 0 : simply listing facts with no further interpretation , 2 : finding patterns across multiple facts ) 0 . 58 CritiqueofFacts ( Evaluate ) Evaluation of facts to raise questions , identify outliers and inconsistencies ( 0 - 1 , where 0 : true , 1 : false ) 0 . 74 Table 1 : Depth of Learning Measures corresponding to the Understand , Analyze and Evaluate Cognitive Learning Lev - els of Anderson and Krathwohl‚Äôs Taxonomy of Learning . [ 24 , 37 ] Fleiss‚Äô ùúÖ is significant at ùëù < 0 . 05 . ( i ) Change in Number of Declared Facts ( Remember ) is measured by the change in number of distinct facts per statement between pre - and post - task summaries . To reliably measure number of facts , we randomly selected 20 % of all 34 pre - and post - summaries for four raters to independently count facts . To account for agree - ment between four raters we calculated the Fleiss‚Äô ùúÖ . The raters had an inter - rater reliability of 0 . 74 Fleiss‚Äô ùúÖ . The rest was coded by one of the raters . ( ii ) Depth of Learning ( Understand , Analyze , Evaluate ) is measured by three metrics proposed by Wilson and Wilson [ 37 ] ( refer to Table 1 ) . ( iii ) Degree of Problem Definition ( Create ) To understand the process of moving from an ill - defined to a well - defined problem scope ( i . e . from level 1 : Problem Discovery to level 5 : Problem Definition ) we adopt Abdulla and Crammond‚Äôs Problem Finding Hierarchy [ 1 ] . Level 1 : Problem Discovery : the prob - lem statement is very ill - defined or defined very similar to the given problem . There is no relevant information and no insight to build on . Level 2 : Problem Formulation : the problem statement is yet to specify the problem , however , there is enough information that they could discover insights from . Level 3 : Problem Construction : the problem statement includes some background information , but the problem finder needs to further evaluate the information to specify a well - informed and well - reasoned problem . Level 4 : Problem Iden - tification : the problem statement includes some information and has some preliminary insights about the problem ; however , there is no specific problem identified or the problem identified is still rather vague . Level 5 : Problem Definition : ( most well - defined stage of problem finding ) the problem statement identifies as specific , well - informed and well - reasoned problem . When classifying the pre - and post - task problem statements , the raters had an agreement of 0 . 69 Fleiss‚Äôs ùúÖ 3 RESULTS 10 participants chose to work on the topic of the Last Mile problem ; 10 on Safe Roadways ; 8 on Equitable Access and 6 on Autonomous Vehicles . Since there were no significant differences in search be - havior across the topics , for the remainder of this paper we do not differentiate between search task topics , and treat them as indepen - dent trials of the study . Short Paper CHIIR ‚Äô21 , March 14 ‚Äì 19 , 2021 , Canberra , Australia 326 3 . 1 What information goals do searchers have during early - stage design ? Participants reported using web search to fulfill the following infor - mation goals : ( i ) To get an overview of the information space : 22 participants mentioned wanting to know key concepts and termi - nology in their chosen topic and related topic areas . As P39 wrote , they searched " to learn more about related topics and potential av - enues to go down ; for basic understanding of concepts " . 14 participants mentioned wanting to know more about the " history and current practices to get the context and background " ( P16 ) . 4 participants mentioned wanting to search for perspectives of users and experts . As P99 stated , " search forums for solutions to see if other users or experts have encountered similar issues . . . to collect related images and concepts . " ( ii ) To discover design patterns and criteria : 27 participants mentioned that they used web search to analyze and evaluate found information by trying to determine patterns and critique how different pieces relate to one another through differ - entiating , organizing , and attributing . For example , P12 stated that they use web search to , " compare and check ideas to come up with a criteria and give me some direction " , and as PO3 stated , " to look for counterpoints or alternatives " . ( iii ) To seek inspiration and gen - erate ideas : 21 participants mentioned using web search to get inspiration to plan to or to generate ideas . For example , P48 says that they search , " to find design inspiration when I am starting a design . . . . to check and compare existing solutions . " Similarly , P115 states that they - " seek design inspiration from what others have done as well as find resources to make the design possible . " . 3 . 2 What search strategies emerged to meet these information goals ? Results from the post - task survey enrich our understanding of chal - lenges faced and strategies employed by searchers to fulfill the above - mentioned information goals . 29 participants reported strug - gling to formulate their informational needs as a query . For example , P9 stated , " I didn‚Äôt know what to search for . . . I don‚Äôt know what I don‚Äôt know and what I‚Äôm missing out on . I have this FOMO [ Fear of Missing out ] like feeling " . To try to better articulate their information need in an effective query , participants talked about issuing multiple queries in quick succession in an iterative manner . For example , P8 issued their first query " congestion " followed by the queries : " Car congestion san diego " , " car congestion san diego map " , " car congestion san diego hotspots " , " car congestion san diego hotspots map " , " road congestion solutions san diego " , " environmental - friendly road conges - tion solutions san diego " . Commenting on this P8 said that their strategy was to " start searches broad and then add terms to narrow down by adding terms " . This strategy was used by other participants to specify contexts ( e . g . P8‚Äôs " san diego " ) , information sources ( e . g . P8‚Äôs " map " ) , or other constraints ( e . g . P8‚Äôs " environmental - friendly " ) . Another strategy to help articulate information needs as queries was to ask natural language questions ‚Äì like P6 stated , " I didn‚Äôt know how to phrase it as a search . I just searched the way I would tell it to my friend and hoped something interesting came up " ( for the query : " why unsafe driving behavior on the rise ? " ) . These natural language questions , and adding terms to specify the query tend to make these queries longer than keyword queries [ 2 ] . 12 participants reported challenges learning domain - specific terminology . P16 illustrates this in their use of the term " hub " " I didn‚Äôt know what the term for a bus or train station generally was in urban design . Now that I found it in an article , it makes it so much easier to search " P16 used the term " hub " across 7 consequent queries . Additionally , 10 participants reported challenges assessing the usefulness of information . P19 discusses their strategy to assess usefulness of search results " I now know this is a reliable source since a lot of articles refer to it " . Similarly , P18 also said , " it occurs as the top result across multiple queries so it must be relevant and trustworthy " . Participants also reported " opening webpages in new tabs for reading later " ( almost like a " bookmarking " strategy ) . 3 . 3 How do web search behaviors affect creative learning outcomes ? From the search log data we defined key searching behaviors : the number , depth , diversity of queries and number of webpages opened . Doing more of these search behaviors were indicative of more " active searching behavior " . 3 . 3 . 1 Active , Diverse Searching Behavior Correlate with Learning More Facts . To analyze how search behavior relates to the change in number of declared facts post - compared to pre - search , we per - formed correlation analyses ( see Table 2 ) . We found a significant correlation where searchers who saw the greatest increase in num - ber of declared facts also tended to have issued more , longer , more diverse queries , and opened more web pages . 3 . 3 . 2 Active Searching Behavior Relates to Articulating Deeper In - sights and More Well - Defined Problem Statements . To understand the relationship between search behavior and the depth of learn - ing measures , we performed ordinal logistic regression analyses . First , we explore the relationship between search behavior and how well searchers " understand " the information space ( as measured by Quality of Facts ) [ 37 ] . Searchers who issued more queries , and opened more web pages had significantly higher increases in qual - ity of facts mentioned post - rather than pre - task . There were no significant differences in the length or diversity of queries issued with respect to the change in quality of facts reported ( see Table 3 ( a ) ) . Second , we explored how search behavior corresponds to how participants " analyze " the information space ( as measured by Inter - pretation of Facts ) [ 37 ] . We found that searchers who issued more , longer and more diverse queries had significantly higher increases in their interpretation scores post - rather than pre - task . There was no significant difference in change of interpretation scores with respect to the number of web pages opened ( see Table 3 ( b ) ) . Third , we explored how search behavior relates to how well participants " evaluate " the information space ( Critique of Facts ) [ 37 ] . Searchers who issued longer and more diverse queries had significantly higher increases in critique scores , post - rather than pre - task . There were no significant differences in change of critique Measure r p Number of Queries 0 . 69 < 0 . 01 * * Length of Queries 0 . 38 0 . 03 * Diversity of Query 0 . 18 0 . 04 * Number of Webpages 0 . 65 0 . 02 * Table 2 : A correlation analysis found significant positive re - lationship between higher gain in facts stated and issuing more , longer , more diverse queries , and opening the more web . * significant at ùëù < 0 . 05 , * * significant at ùëù < 0 . 01 Short Paper CHIIR ‚Äô21 , March 14 ‚Äì 19 , 2021 , Canberra , Australia 327 Measure Odds Ratio p ( a ) Quality of Facts Number of Queries 1 . 28 < 0 . 01 * * Length of Queries 0 . 20 1 . 20 Diversity of Query 1 . 09 0 . 08 Number of Webpages 1 . 04 0 . 03 * ( b ) Interpretation of Facts Number of Queries 1 . 71 < 0 . 01 * * Length of Queries 1 . 23 0 . 03 * Diversity of Query 1 . 11 0 . 03 * Number of Webpages 0 . 75 0 . 17 ( c ) Critique of Facts Number of Queries 1 . 09 0 . 09 Length of Queries 1 . 42 0 . 04 * Diversity of Query 1 . 64 0 . 02 * Number of Webpages 0 . 96 0 . 89 ( d ) Degree of Problem Definition Number of Queries 1 . 27 < 0 . 01 * * Length of Queries 1 . 04 0 . 03 * Diversity of Query 1 . 10 0 . 02 * Number of Webpages 0 . 75 1 . 20 Table 3 : More active and diverse searching relates to deeper learning and more well - defined problems . Ordinal Logistic regression analyses results * ùëù < 0 . 05 , * * ùëù < 0 . 01 scores with respect to the number of queries issued and web pages opened ( see Table 3 ( c ) ) . Last , searchers who issued more , longer and more diverse queries also have significantly better defined problems post - search than pre - search . There is no significant difference in problem definition level with respect to the number of webpages opened ( refer to Table 3 ( d ) for details ) . All analyses were corrected against effects of multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction . Overall , we observe that more active , diverse searching ( as shown by issuing more , longer , and diverse queries , and opening more web pages ) generally corresponds to higher increases in creative learning outcomes ( such as gathering more facts , articulating deeper insights , and framing more well - defined problems ) . 4 DISCUSSION This paper sheds light on how people use the web to search for information during early - stage design to help them frame a problem . By analyzing search log and survey data , we find that searchers have cognitively - complex information goals during early - stage design ‚Äì goals that go beyond the recall and lookup tasks that current search tools are optimized to fulfill ( ref . 3 . 1 ) [ 25 , 28 , 35 , 41 ] . Designers‚Äô information goals include learning about key concepts and terminology , history and current practices , and the perspectives of users and experts to get an overview of the information space . This exploratory behavior is consistent with research that describes how designers explore a problem space to find a problem [ 15 ] and then iteratively re - framing that problem by discovering and integrating new information [ 10 , 27 , 31 ] . This divergent exploration and convergent synthesis is a hallmark of the design process [ 18 ] and is exemplified in the Design Thinking model [ 33 ] . Additional information goals included wanting to discover design patterns and criteria , and seek inspiration to generate hypotheses and ideas . Trying to surface patterns and previously unknown connection can be an effective technique to also generate ideas through creative combination ( i . e . coming up with something new by combining two concepts / ideas ) [ 5 , 13 , 32 , 36 ] and analogical reasoning ( i . e . the process of making connections through examples ) [ 17 , 19 , 34 ] . Searchers reported challenges scoping broad , ill - defined infor - mation needs into queries , learning domain - specific language , and assessing the usefulness of information . Theses challenges are re - lated to those faced by design novices [ 8 , 10 , 15 , 18 , 30 ] . Active , di - verse searching strategies ( such as issuing more , longer , and diverse queries , and opening more web pages ) related to higher creative learning gains ( such as more , better quality facts and insights , and more well - defined problems ) . This strategy of iteratively probing the information space is similar to the design - thinking strategy of using prototyping as a method for actively probing and getting feedback from the design space and user community [ 10 , 18 , 27 , 31 ] . By issuing more frequent and diverse queries and opening more webpages , searchers might have had more opportunities to learn terms to better articulate their queries , explore a subset of the in - formation space and develop their relevance judgement criteria . Promoting discovery of domain - specific language and query di - versity should be an important design goal for future search tools . They should build on work like [ 4 , 6 , 7 , 17 ] , to guide novice de - signers to articulate more diverse queries and support discovery of domain - specific language , hypothesis and idea generation . We observed significant relationships between active searching behavior and creative learning outcomes , however , we cannot make any causal claims . It could be that these relationships are a better reflection of the searchers‚Äô skills or aptitude , rather than a function of specific strategies . Future work needs to conduct a large - scale analysis of naturalistic search behavior during design to further test the hypotheses generated by this short paper . Furthermore , the study has limitations as it tried to balance ecological validity with experimental control . For instance , we controlled all participants‚Äô search sessions to be 30 minutes long to help us compare between participants . However , this might be different from the individuals‚Äô usual searching behavior . Since complex search tasks such as ex - ploratory search are often carried out over multiple sessions and devices [ 25 , 35 , 40 ] , we encouraged participants to continue search - ing beyond this session , and to think of this as their first search session . Future research is required to overcome these limitations , build out and test suggested design implications of these findings . 5 CONCLUSION By collecting and analyzing search log and self - report data from 34 students in a project - based design course , this paper provides insights into the information goals , challenges faced , and strategies used by people when using web search during early - stage creative processes . This paper applies measures from information science and creativity research to operationalize creative learning outcomes in early - stage design . We learned that active , diverse searching ( as shown by issuing more , longer , and diverse queries , and opening more web pages ) relates to higher gains in creative learning out - comes ( such as breadth , depth of learning and problem framing ) . We conclude by reflecting on our findings to propose design im - plications for search systems to support cognitively - complex tasks such as creative learning during design .
