data , including the Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO ) [ 1 ] and ArrayExpress [ 2 ] have started accepting whole - genome epigenetic datasets created by RNA - seq and ChIP - seq tech - nologies . These very large datasets present a challenge for efficient data retrieval system developers . Current tools for microarray data retrieval can be classified into a few catego - ries ( Table 1 ) . The first category includes the Gene Expres - sion Atlas [ 3 ] , developed by the European Bioinformatics Institute ( EBI ) , and GEO , developed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information ( NCBI ) . The advantage of these tools is their ability to search for specific gene expres - sion patterns under specific biological conditions . How - ever , searching is only possible after all data have been pre - analyzed ; therefore , these tools offer very limited search coverage of about 9 % ( Supplementary Figure 1 ) .

As a result , a large number of diverse high - throughput functional genomic data retrieval systems have been developed . However , high - throughput functional genomic data retrieval remains challenging . Methods : We developed Gene Expression data Explore ( GEE ) , the first powerful , flexible web and mobile search applica - tion for searching whole - genome epigenetic data and microarray data in public databases , such as GEO and ArrayExpress . Results : GEE provides an elaborate , convenient interface of query generation competences not available via various high - throughput functional genomic data retrieval systems , including GEO , ArrayExpress , and Atlas . In particular , GEE provides a suitable query generator using eVOC , the Experimental Factor Ontology ( EFO ) , which is well represented with a variety of high - throughput functional genomic data experimental conditions . In addition , GEE provides an experimental design query constructor ( EDQC ) , which provides elaborate retrieval filter conditions when the user designs real experiments .

Introduction Major public repositories for microarray gene - expression Reviewed JanuaryFebruaryMarchApril May June JulyAugust September October November December 82 www . e - hir . org Soo Youn Lee et al http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 4258 / hir . 2016 . 22 . 2 . 81 by EBI , which retrieve high - throughput functional genomic data based on the free - text metadata of experiments . These tools are divided into two types . The first type enables the user to input free - text keywords in a search system to search experiments related to specific biological conditions . The second type involves controlled vocabulary or ontology - based query systems . Given the vast diversity of biological conditions under which functional genomic datasets are created , queries are systematically guided by standardized terminologies for cell types , diseases , organism parts , etc . , and their combinations may greatly improve performance and reduce the ambiguity of retrieval . These tools use a vari - ety of controlled vocabulary or ontologies . Representative of GEO , ArrayExpress uses Medical Subject Headings ( MeSH ) [ 4 ] and Experimental Factor Ontology ( EFO ) [ 5 ] . MeSH allows the construction of terms that are easy to navigate and are useful to the search system because it consists of a hierarchy with 2013 trees ( http : / / www . nlm . nih . gov / mesh / introduction . html ) . However , MeSH was created for index - ing medical literature . Accordingly , MeSH does not include experiment - related terms such as “flow - sorted , ” “Affymetrix Gene Chip ontology , ” or “0 hour treatment . ” Thus , MeSH is not suitable for controlled vocabulary when an experiment search is performed . EBI overcame the limitations of MeSH by creating the EFO to which they applied the ArrayExpress search system . EFO provides a systematic description of many experimental variables ; however , this ontology does not have a suitable structure for term navigation when an experiment search is conducted , because each category only has a depth of 2 – 4 ( http : / / purl . bioontology . org / ontology / EFO ) experimental conditions . For example , EBI tools ( Atlas , ArrayExpress ) provide only four filter conditions . We aimed to overcome the limitations of previous retrieval tools by developing Gene Expression data Explore ( GEE ) , which uses eVOC and EFO to overcome the limitation of previous controlled - vocabulary - based search systems . eVOC is a controlled vocabulary for unifying gene expression data [ 6 ] . eVOC and EFO are representative ontologies for the description of high - throughput functional genomics data . The eVOC and EFO ontologies include essential terms for the efficient retrieval of high - throughput functional genomic datasets . eVOC is an ontology that associates labeled target cDNAs for microarray experiments , or cDNA libraries and their associated transcripts with controlled terms in a set of hierarchical vocabularies and consists of 4 orthogonal controlled vocabularies , including anatomical system , cell type , pathology , and developmental stage . eVOC has a well - defined classification structure for term navigation ; however , T a b l e 1 .

On the other hand , EFO has about 7 , 000 terms , but a poor classification structure . Thus , we merged eVOC and EFO by retaining the structure of eVOC to reflect the search system of GEE . GEE provides a specific advanced search system called the experiment design query constructor ( EDQC ) , which provides five cat - egories and 13 filter conditions , including “antibody” , and includes 1 , 516 terms . Previous search systems provide only web applications ; however , GEE provides the first mobile application . Thus , users are able to perform an experiment search regardless of time and place . The GEE website is http : / / www . snubi . org / software / gee , and the GEE app can be downloaded from the Apple App Store . II . Methods 1 . Data Collection and Management GEE covers all transcriptomic platforms , including RNA - seq and ChIP - seq , as well as different types of microarray tech - nologies . GEE archives 31 , 245 high - throughput functional genomic datasets with 710 , 038 samples extracted from GEO and ArrayExpress , i . e . , 978 ( 911 samples ; 2 , 408 platform types ) and 30 , 267 ( 709 , 127 samples ; 8 , 127 platform types ) experiments from ArrayExpress and GEO , respectively . Ad - ditionally , 2 , 720 highly curated GEO DataSets ( GDS ) are in - cluded ( Supplementary Figure 1A ) . GEE has the largest data scope ( standard date : 2012 . 01 . 01 ) . 2 . eVOC Ontology - Based Annotation of Datasets We downloaded the OBO file format of the eVOC ontology and the owl format of the EFO ontology from the bioportal website ( http : / / bioportal . bioontology . org ) [ 7 ] . We extracted terms , synonyms , and associated information . Next , stop words were removed and executed . Stemming and normal - ization of eVOC terms , EFO terms , and all of the synonyms were performed by application of the Porter stemming algo - rithm . Then , we merged 2 , 264 eVOC terms and 5 , 081 terms from EFO using the bioportal mapping list ( Supplementary Table 1 ) , after which we mapped EFO to eVOC because the eVOC structure is well defined . We annotated all the high - throughput functional genomic datasets with ontology terms , which were processed using text mining . We anno - tated the datasets by using a MySQL full - text search method with four filter conditions . A different query method was applied to each category of terms ( Supplementary Figure 2 ) . Our work showed that the use of a full - text search method with 4 filter conditions and different query methods using eVOC and EFO is the best approach among several methods we tried for mapping ( Supplementary Figure 3 ) . 3 . User Interface Feature 1 ) SEARCH option in web version of GEE The GEE web interface contains two sections for generat - ing search queries ( Figure 1A ) . Section I offers an ontology - based keyword search function , which enables a user to select multiple ontology terms from an ontology term tree . Section II contains an EDQC , which enables a user to gener - ate a query when designing experiments for high - through - put functional genomic data . The EDQC values were human curated . The EDQC consists of 3 classes , 5 parts , and 14 sub - parts . The sample condition class is composed of the sample extraction type , used anti - body , gene modification , organ - ism , sex , and population . This class includes information as - sociated with samples . The analysis class is composed of data normalization and data quality controls . This class includes information associated with data analysis . The platform class is composed of protocol manufacture , kinds of arrays , plat - form technology , platform support , platform coating , and platform hardware . This class included platform informa - tion , such as experiments using ChIP - seq or RNA - seq . All selected components are performed independently . Users can generate multiplex combination queries using all kinds of classes and terms . Furthermore , these queries provide correct results according to user - defined logic , and redun - dant results are removed . More information can be found in Figure 2B . 2 ) SEARCH option in app version of GEE The GEE app enables the retrieval of high - throughput func - tional genomic datasets using eVOC ontology terms . The app provides a user friendly methodology . Initially , the user would have to download and install the GEE app from the Apple App Store . Next , the user uses one click to select the search term from among the eVOC ontology terms . When the user clicks the selected term , the GEE app provides a high - throughput functional genomic list of datasets from which a dataset name could be selected to obtain more infor - mation about the specific genomics . As a result , the GEE app displays more detailed information when the user selects the dataset . The app interface is shown in more detail in Figure 1B . The GEE app is currently under review in the Apple App Store . 3 ) GEE web and app interface construction of GEE The GEE web version was created by using Hypertext Mark - up Language 5 ( HTML5 ) , cascading style sheets 3 ( CSS3 ) 84 www . e - hir . org Soo Youn Lee et al http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 4258 / hir . 2016 . 22 . 2 . 81 and jQuery . The web version of GEE is available on the web at http : / / matrix . snubi . org : 8080 / GEE _ index . jsp , and the app version of GEE is available from the Apple App Store . 4 . Comparing Search Performance of Other Search Tools to GEE We used four keywords ( “breast cancer , ” “stem cell , ” “lung cancer , ” and “myocardial infarction” ) , which are the most frequently submitted terms in the PubMed query log [ 8 ] . We used our proposed tool to extract 500 GDS datasets ran - domly from among the GDS datasets . In addition , the same 4 keywords were used to manually extract related datasets from the 500 GDS datasets , after which the intersection data - set was extracted from the human curated datasets . We used GEO , ArrayExpress , and GEE to search this dataset using the 4 keywords obtained from the 500 datasets , after which we again obtained the intersection dataset with human curated datasets . Finally , we calculated the search performance using precision , by recalling the F - measure method ( Supplemen - tary Table 2 ) . 5 . SOFT and MAGE - TAB Conversion GEE provides MAGE - TAB [ 9 ] and SOFT conversion . This enhances the efficiency of the retrieval process by allowing the use of filter conditions and specific queries . We extracted all attributes from MAGE - TAB . Specification ver . 1 . 1 has been made available together with SOFT guidelines ( http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / geo / info / soft2 . html ) , and the rela - tion rules were created manually ( Supplementary Table 3 ) . The results provided on the GEE website are based on the results obtained by using the conversion rules . Overall , our scheme maps the GEO series ( GSE ) attributes to investiga - tion description format ( IDF ) , sample and data relationship format ( SDRF ) , and raw and processed data files are mapped to GEO samples ( GSM ) , and array design format ( ADF ) is mapped to GEO platform ( GPL ) .

Results 1 . Combined Effect of Using Ontology and EDQC GEE uses an EDQC and an ontology - based query system to search high - throughput functional genomic data by using a pre - annotated data table . We calculated the mapping cover - age in GEE according to the method described in Supple - mentary Table 2 . We tested three conditions , including using only ontology ( Supplementary Figure 4A ) , using only EDQC ( Supplementary Figure 4B ) , and using ontology with EDQC ( Supplementary Figure 4C and D ) . The results were calcu - lated by each data format . Most data formats had more than 95 % mapping coverage . Unfortunately , ADF was obtained when using ontology , with GSE in EDQC being the excep - tion . However , all the conditions improved when ontology was combined with EDQC ( Supplementary Figure 4C and D ) . This enabled us to conclude that a combination of ontol - ogy and EDQC is effective for searching high - throughput functional genomic data . 2 . Comparing the Search Performance of Previous High - Throughput Functional Genomic Data Searching Sys - tem and GEE We calculated the precision , recall , and F - measure to com - pare the searching performance of GEO , ArrayExpress , and GEE . We randomly extracted 500 GDS datasets and used 4 keywords for sample queries . The keywords that were ex - tracted were those most frequently submitted in the PubMed query log [ 8 ] . Details of the method are described in the Method section and Supplementary Table 2 . The most im - portant aspect of a search system is to search for the correct data in user defined queries and to ensure an abundance of results . These conditions can be satisfied by ensuring har - mony between precision and the recall result .

The testing results show that GEE achieved the best score for all performance measurements compared to other tools ( Figure 3 ) . In particular , the recall result was perfect . This result shows that GEE searches the correct data in any biological query . Moreover , the F - mea - sure is the most effective for testing , which means that GEE searches more accurately than GEO and ArrayExpress . 3 . Example Query Using GEE As shown in Figure 1A , the result of using the web version of GEE is that only the elements that are the most critical are shown and provide a good overview of the datasets in GEO or ArrayExpress with a hyperlink to each dataset . A search example using the web version of GEE is shown in Figure 1A . We demonstrated the performance of the web version of GEE by retrieving a particular sample query using the EDQC . The first sample query was executed by using “ChIP - seq , ” “embryonic stem cell , ” and “homo sapiens , ” containing more than 20 samples in the keywords from one dataset . “ChIP - seq” and “homo sapiens” contained more than 20 key - word samples from the EDQC in Section II and “embryonic stem cell” from the ontology term tree in Section I ( Figure 1A ) . GEO , ArrayExpress , and GEE each produced 6 datasets as results ( GSE36114 , GSE32970 . . . etc . , 984 samples , 5 plat - form ) , 0 result datasets , and 18 experiment datasets as results ( GSE30226 , GSE30227 . . . etc . , 536 samples , 0 platforms ) in response to the query . The second sample query was based on the use of “ana - plastic astrocytoma , ” and “eye neoplasm” as keywords . Both keywords are from the ontology tree in Section I ( Figure 1A ) . GEO , ArrayExpress , and GEE each produced 0 datasets and 63 datasets ( GSE7330 . . . etc . , 921 samples , 0 platform ) . However , ArrayExpress did not support sample count filter - ing , and the sample data link was broken . GEE provides a description of each dataset and its download link . Therefore , the user can download data when the dataset permission is opened . The app version of GEE consists of two parts . Part I pro - vides easy retrieval of high - throughput functional genomic data using an eVOC ontology tree with just one touch . When the user selects a term , the GEE app provides a list of related datasets , and term information appears when the user selects the dataset . Part II displays a summary of the in - formation and a detailed description of the selected datasets . The resulting sample is presented in Figure 1B . IV . Discussion GEE has four main benefits , which will be discussed in detail in this section . First GEE enables specific queries to be made using eVOC and EFO vocabularies and the EDQC system . Moreover , it is possible to retrieve suitable high - throughput functional genomic datasets consisting of free text from diverse biological conditions . Biologists often design and execute new experiments because they are unable to easily find suitable experiment datasets . Therefore , many duplicate datasets are generated and saved in GEO and ArrayExpress . We expect all of these problems to be resolved through the EDQC of GEE because the EDQC will be able to provide suitable queries when users design experiments . Second , GEE had the largest dataset scope , currently based on August 1 , 2012 . GEE archives 31 , 245 high - throughput functional genomic datasets ( 710 , 038 samples ) from GEO and ArrayExpress . This huge data scope , including whole - genome epigenetic datasets , provides a wealth of resulting datasets upon retrieval . Beside GEE , there are several tools with which to retrieve datasets , such as the Microarray Re - triever [ 10 ] , GEOmetadb [ 11 ] , M2DB [ 12 ] , and Oncomine [ 13 ] . However , they do not provide whole - genome epigen - etic datasets , such as RNA - seq and ChIP - seq . Therefore , there is no need for the user to simultaneously access both repositories when GEE is used . In addition , GEE provides a searching result for each platform together with sample information . This function provides elaborate information of high - throughput functional genomic datasets . Third , GEE provides two optimized user systems : a web GEE 1 . 0 0 . 8 0 . 6 0 . 4 0 . 2 V a l ue Search system 0 Precision Recall F - measure GEO AR GEE GEO AR 0 . 77 1 . 00 0 . 85 0 . 48 0 . 85 0 . 60 0 . 55 0 . 76 0 . 62 PrecisionRecallF - measure Figure 3 .

Every high - throughput func - tional genomic data retrieval system simply consists of web - based applications . However , GEE also provides a mobile app , which is convenient , rapid , and portable for the user . The GEE app is the first mobile application to search high - throughput functional genomic datasets . Assuming that users have smartphones , they will be provided with suitable high - throughput functional genomic datasets after just one click of the mobile app of GEE ; thus , the mobile app allows the user flexibility . Fourth , GEE is available with specific filter conditions and retrieval using MAGE - TAB and SOFT , the high - throughput functional genomic dataset formats of AR and GEO , re - spectively , with attributes such as platform technology , and a sample treatment protocol based on the MAGE - TAB and SOFT converter . These attributes allow the user to specify conditions for specific queries , and these queries contribute to the retrieval of accurate datasets in large high - throughput functional genomic datasets . As mentioned previously , GEE is the only tool that enables the retrieval of whole - genome epigenetic datasets and has a mobile app . GEE is also the only application that offers an elaborate searching system that uses the EDQC and ontology trees . We expect GEE ( http : / / www . snubi . org / software / gee ) to promote the evolu - tion of retrieving high - throughput functional genomic data - sets . In the coming years , the number of whole - genome epigen - etic and microarray datasets is expected to increase explo - sively . Therefore , the problems associated with the retrieval of large high - throughput functional genomic datasets are becoming increasingly important . GEE can play a key role in solving this problem .
