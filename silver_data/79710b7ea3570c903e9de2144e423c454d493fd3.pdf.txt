One Hip oligomer binds the ATPase domains of at least two Hsc70 moleculesdependent on activation of the Hsc70 ATPase by Hsp40 . While hydrolysis remains the rate - limiting step in the ATPase cycle , Hip stabilizes the ADP state of Hsc70 that has a high affinity for substrate protein . Through its own chaperone activity , Hip may contribute to the interaction of Hsc70 with various tar - get proteins . We propose a mechanism for the regula - tion of eukaryotic Hsc70 that is distinct from that of bacterial Hsp70 . The Hsc70 / Hsp40 / Hip system is ap - parently independent of a GrpE - like nucleotide ex - change factor . Introduction Molecular chaperones of the heat shock protein 70 ( Hsp70 ) family function in widely different aspects of pro - tein biogenesis in eukaryotic cells , both under normal growth conditions and under cellular stress ( reviewed by Hendrick and Hartl , 1993 ; Craig et al . , 1994 ) . In coopera - tion with other chaperones , they stabilize preexistent pro - teins against aggregation and mediate the folding of newly translated polypeptides in the cytosol as well as within organelles . The Hsp70s in mitochondria and the endoplas - mic reticulum play an additional role by providing a driving force for protein translocation ( reviewed by Hijhfeld and Hartl , 1994 ; Stuartetal . , 1994 ) AIinkbetweenthefunction of the Hsp70 class of chaperones and cellular proteolysis has also been demonstrated ( reviewed by Craig et al . , 1994 ) . Finally , Hsp70s are involved in signal transduction pathways in cooperation with - Hsp90 ( reviewed by Bohen and Yamamoto , 1994 ; Rutherford and Zuker , 1994 ) . Hsp70s participate in all these processes through their ability to recognize nonnative conformations of other pro - teins . They bind extended peptide segments with a net hydrophobic character exposed by polypeptides during translation and membrane translocation , or following stress - induced damage ( Flynn et al . , 1991 ; Palleros et al . , 1991 ; Landry et al . , 1992 ; Blond - Elguindi et al . , 1993 ) . * Present address : Zentrum fijr Molekulare Biologie , UniversitBt Hei - delberg , D - 69120 Heidelberg , Federal Republic of Germany . Peptide binding is mediated by a carboxy - terminal - 25 kDa domain of Hsp70 ( Wang et al . , 1993 ; Freeman et al . , 1995 ) and is regulated by the binding of ATP to the - 44 kDa amino - terminal domain ( Chappell et al . , 1987 ; Flah - erty et al . , 1990 ) . Nucleotide - induced conformational changes of the conserved ATPase core are transmitted to the carboxy - terminal region , modulating its intrinsic peptide affinity . The ATP - bound form of Hsp70 binds and releases peptide rapidly , whereas the ADP - bound form binds and releases slowly ( Palleros et al . , 1991 ; Schmid et al . , 1994 ; Szabo et al . , 1994 ) . Cycling of Hsp70 between these nucleotide states depends on its interaction with regulatory proteins such as DnaJ and GrpE of Escherichia coli . DnaJ , a chaperone on its own ( Langer et al . , 1992 ) , activates the ATPase of the bacterial Hsp70 homolog DnaK ( Libereket al . , 1991 ) . GrpEfunctionsasanucleotide exchange factor ( Liberek et al . , 1991 ; Szabo et al . , 1994 ) allowing rebinding of ATP that in turn promotes substrate dissociation ( Palleros et al . , 1993 ; Szabo et al . , 1994 ) . Unlike the situation in bacteria , the functional regulation of Hsp70 in the eukaryotic cytosol is not yet understood . DnaJ homologs have been identified in all compartments of eukaryotic cells that contain Hsp70 ( Cyr et al . , 1994 ) , but a GrpE homolog has only been found in mitochondria , organelles derived from prokaryotic ancestors ( Stuart et al . , 1994 ) . This is surprising , since GrpE binds to a loop region in the ATPase domain of DnaK that is conserved in eukaryotic Hsp70s ( Buchberger et al . , 1994 ) . We have used the yeast two - hybrid system to identify proteins that regulate the constitutively expressed Hsp70 protein , Hsc70 , in the mammalian cytosol by interacting with its ATPase domain . This led to the cloning of a rat gene , encoding the novel Hsc70 - interacting protein Hip . The cytosolic Hip protein is not homologous to GrpE , but cooperates with Hsc70 in stabilizing and modulating the conformation of various target proteins . Hip functions both as a regulator of Hsc70 and as a molecular chaperone . Results Identification of Hip A screen for Hsc70interacting proteins was performed utilizing the yeast two - hybrid system ( Bartel et al . , 1993 ) . The ATPase domain of rat Hsc70 ( amino acids l - 383 ) was fused to the DNA - binding domain of GAL4 , and the resulting plasmid was introduced into yeast . Transformed yeast were subsequently cotransformed with a rat liver cDNA library fused to the GAL4 activation domain . Screen - ing of 250 , 000 double transformants , based on HIS3 as the reporter gene , led to the identification of two clones that showed a His + phenotype dependent on the presence of the Hsc70 construct and the activation domain plasmid . In both cases , expression of / acZas an additional reporter gene was increased over the expression measured in a strain carrying the Hsc70 construct alone ( data not shown ) . Cell 590 The activation domain plasmids necessary for growth on histidine - free medium contained cDNA inserts of 1 . 6 and 1 . 7 kb . Nucleotide sequencing revealed that both in - serts encoded the same gene with a large open reading frame of 1107 bp , fused in - frame with the GAL4 gene . The cDNA sequence of the 1 . 7 kb clone contained a eukaryotic translation start site ( Kozak , 1984 ) located 58 bp 3’ of the fusion point and a poly ( A ) tail preceded by polyadenylation signals . The open reading frame predicted a 368 amino acid protein of 41 , 273 Da . The deduced primary sequence is 36 % identical ( 60 % similar ) to a 58 kDa protein of un - known function from Plasmodium berghei termed heat shock - related protein due to the presence of a Hsp70 - like sequence near its carboxyl terminus ( Uparanukraw et al . , 1993 ) ( Figure 1A ) . This sequence comprises multiple re - peats of the tetrapeptide GGMP that is located close to the peptide - binding site of several cytosolic Hsp70s ( Boorstein et al . , 1994 ) . Hip contains seven imperfect GGMP repeats between residues 278 - 311 ( Figures 1A and 1D ) . The carboxy - terminal region of Hip ( residues 316 - 368 ) shows only little similarity to that of the heat shock - related protein from Plasmodium ( Figure lA ) , but is structurally related to the carboxyl terminus of the yeast Stil protein ( Nicolet and Craig , 1989 ) ( 42 % identity ) and its human homolog IEF SSP 3521 ( Honore et al . , 1992 ) ( 30 % identity ) ( Figure 16 ) . Stilp , a stress - induced protein , is part of a larger complex that includes Hsp70 , HspQO , and immu - nophilins ( Smith et al . , 1993 ; Chang and Lindquist , 1994 ) . Stil p belongs to the tetratricopeptide repeat ( TPR ) family of proteins that contain multiple degenerate repeats of a 34 amino acid motif ( Goebl and Yanagida , 1991 ) . Interest - ingly , TPR domains similar to those of Stilp were also identified in Hip between residues 113 and 214 ( Figures 1C and lD ) , and related but more degenerate domains were found in the corresponding segment of the Plasmo - dium homolog . These domains probably mediate protein - protein interactions involved in diverse biological pro - cesses such as nuclear division , mRNA processing , and protein sorting ( Goebl and Yanagida , 1991 ) . Hip is a Cytosolic Homo - Oligomeric Protein To facilitate its biochemical characterization , Hip was ex - pressed in E . coli as a tagged version carrying a Myc epi - tope and six histidine residues at its carboxyl terminus ( tg - Hip ) . Antibodies against Hip were affinity purified using a truncated form of Hip ( residues l - 274 ) lacking the Hsp70 - and Stil p - related domains . The affinity - purified antibody specifically reacted with a 50 kDa polypeptide in immunoblots of bovine liver extracts and upon immuno - precipitation from radiolabeled CHO cells in the presence of high salt and Triton X - 100 ( Figures 2A and 28 ) . The apparent molecular mass of the detected polypeptide is higher than the 41 . 3 kDa calculated from the Hip se - quence . Bacterially expressed Hip had a similar reduced mobility in SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) ( data not shown ) as did the Plasmodium homolog ( Uparanukraw et al . , 1993 ) . Thus , the 50 kDa polypeptide was identified as the hip gene product .

Primary Structure of the hip Gene Product ( A ) Hip is homologous to the 58 kDa heat shock - related protein ( Hrp ) from Plasmodium ( GenBankaccession numbers L04508and L21710 ) . identical residues are boxed . The nucleotide sequence of the rat hip gene is also available from GenBank ( accession number X82021 ) .

( C ) Hip contains three consecutive TPR domains between residues 113 and 214 . Residues of the consensus motif are boxed . Homologies were identified using the BLAST computer program . ( D ) Hip has a distinct domain structure sharing domains with Hrp , Hsc70 , and Stilp . ‘GGMP’ , Hsc70 - related sequence containing multi - ple GGMP repeats . Following cell fractionation , Hip was found exclusively in the high speed supernatant fraction ( Figure 2A ) . The localization of Hip in the cytosol was further indicated by the detection of diffuse cytosolic staining by indirect immu - nofluorescence in CHO cells ( data not shown ) . Hip was found to be constitutively expressed to similar levels in various mouse tissues including brain , testis , kidney , pan - creas , spleen , and heart and was also detectable in rabbit reticulocyte lysate ( data not shown ) . Based on quantitative immunoblotting , Hip amounts to 0 . 1 % of total protein in a rat brain homogenate and is thus expressed at a level similar to that of Hsc70 ( 0 . 1 % ) ( Schlossman et al . , 1984 ) . g $ racterization of the Hsc70 Interacting Protein Hip kDa ) B 97 66 45 31 21 . 5 14 . 5 , ~ & , e ? 91” & VW a . : . / 97 66 45 31 21 . 5 14 . 5 C 660 1 170 lt2 ( kDa ) i + I f I 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Elution volume ( ml ) Figure 2 .

( C ) Gel filtration on Superose 12 of a 100 , 000 x g supernatant fraction of a beef liver extract . Fractionation of Hipwas followed by immunoblot - ting . The extract was either loaded directly onto the column ( - ATP ) , or preincubated with 1 mM ATP at 30°C for 15 min , followed by incuba - tion with 10 U / ml apyrase on ice for 15 min and centrifugation at 100 , 000 x g for 20 min ( + ATP ) . Purified Hiss - tagged Hip was separated as a control following ATP and apyrase treatment ( tg - Hip ) . Tg - Hip was detected by Coomassie blue staining . Upon gel filtration of soluble beef liver proteins , Hip e ! uted at a size of - 160 kDa ( Figure 2C ) . A similar elution profile was observed for purified tg - Hip , indicating that Hip proba - bly forms a homotetramer . Endogenous Hip partially shifted to a higher molecular mass when the liver extract was preincubated with Mg - ATP and gel filtration was per - formed in the absence of nucleotide ( Figure 2C ) . This be - havior is consistent with the ability of Hip to interact with Hsc70 and other cytosolic proteins in an ATP - dependent manner ( see below ) . Identification of Hip - Associated Proteins An affinity procedure was developed to identify potential partner proteins of Hip . Tg - Hip was incubated with a beef liver’extract in the presence of Mg - ATP . The reaction was then depleted of ATP by incubation with apyrase , and Hip complexes were immobilized on Ni * + - NTA agarose . Pro - teins specifically associated with Hip were eluted with Mg - ATP . In addition to a small amount of Hip , the ATP eluate contained two major polypeptides of 72 and 70 kDa that were identified by immunoblotting as the constitutivelyex - pressed Hsc70 ( 72lkDa ) and the heat - inducible Hsp70 , respectively ( Shi and Thomas , 1992 ) ( Figure 3 ) . These results confirmed the interaction of Hip with Hsc70 ob - served in the two - hybrid system . Hip - bound Hsp70s were quantitatively released by Mg - ATP ; only Hip was eluted by a subsequent wash of the NF + - NTA agarose with imid - azole ( data not shown ) . Minor amounts of polypeptides between 40 and 160 kDa in size were also detectable in the ATP eluate ( Figure 3A ) . Their retention may reflect an association with the Hsp70s rather than a direct , ATP - dependent interaction with im - mobilized Hip . lmmunoblotting identified a 90 kDa protein as Hsp90 ( Figure 3B ) . Hsp70 - Hsp90 complexes assem - ble transiently in the eukaryotic cytosol ( Bohen and Yama - moto , 1994 ) , and Hip may be able to bind such complexes via its affinity for Hsp70 . lmmunoblot analysis also de - tected the mammalian DnaJ homolog Hsp40 ( Ohtsuka , 1993 ; Frydman et al . , 1994 ) in the ATP eluate ( Figure 3B ) . Like Hsc70 , Hsp40 was greatly enriched on the Hip affinity matrix , but direct binding of purified Hsp40 to Hip was not detectable in reconstitution experiments ( see below ) . Thus , Hsc79 appears to interact simultaneously with Hip and Hsp40 : ; A ( kDa : 200 116 97 66 45 31 21 . 5 anti - Hsp90 isp90 + X70 isp70 I tg - Hip anti - Hsp70 anti - Hsp40 Figure 3 . Analysis of Hip - Associated Proteins ( A ) Bovine Hsp70s and Hsp90 are specifically retained on immobilized Hip . Tg - Hip ( 0 . 3 mg ) was incubated with soluble beef liver proteins in the presence of 1 mM ATP at 30°C for 15 min , followed by addition of 10 U / ml apyrase and 30 pl of Ni * + - NTA agarose and further incuba - tion at 4 % for 30 min ( see Experimental Procedures ) . After washing , Hip - associated proteins were eluted by incubation with 50 nM ATP at 30OCfor 10 min ( + tg - Hip ) . A control sample , lacking tg - Hip , was treated in the same way ( - tg - Hip ) . 0 . 7 % of the total sample ( T ) and 50 % of the ATP - eluted material were separated by SDS - PAGE and analyzed by Coomassie blue staining . ( 6 ) lmmunoblot analysis of the ATP eluate from immobilized tg - Hip using specific antibodies against Hsp70 , Hsp90 , and Hsp40 . Cell 592 Detection of Hip in a Complex with Newly Translated Polypeptides Both Hsc70 and Hsp40 are involved in protein folding by stabilizing nascent polypeptide chains emerging from ribo - somes ( Beckman et al . , 1990 ; Frydman et al . , 1994 ) . We investigated whether Hip participates in this process through its interaction with Hsc70 . Complexes of Hip with Hsc70 , Hsp40 , Hsp90 , or some combination of these were isolated from an ATP - depleted reticulocyte lysate by co - immunoprecipitation with anti - Hip antibody ( Figure 4A ) . When firefly luciferase was translated in the reticulocyte lysate prior to ATP depletion , the Hip antibody also copre - cipitated nascent chains of luciferase , albeit with lower efficiency than an antibody against Hsc70 ( Figure 4B , top ) . Neither antibody precipitated the full - length protein , which folds to the native state with high efficiency ( Frydman et al . , 1994 ) . These results are consistent with the precipita - tion of Hsc70 - associated translation products via the affin - ity of Hip for Hsc70 . The Hsc70 in this complex apparently interacts with Hsp40 ( Figure 4A ) . The presence of Hsp90 in the anti - Hip precipitate raised the possibility that Hip may also be part of chaperone com - plexes containing Hsc70 , , Hsp90 , and other factors . These complexes have been implicated in the biogenesis and conformational , regulation of certain signaling molecules including the transforming tyrosine kinase pp60”“” ( re - viewed by Rutherford and Zuker , 1994 ) . The reticulocyte * , - lysate has been used to reproduce these interactions ( Hutchinson et al . , 1992 ) . Upon in vitro translation , pp60”“” was indeed specifically coprecipitated by the anti - Hip anti - body ( Figure 4B , bottom ) . In contrast with firefly luciferase , full - length pp60v - Src is known to persist in a chaperone com - plex after completion of translation ( Hutchinson et al . , 1992 ) . We conclude that both Hip and Hsc70 are part of a chaperone assembly that is involved in mediating the fold - ing of newly synthesized polypeptides in the cytosol . In addition , Hip may cooperate with Hsc70 and Hsp90 in the biogenesis and regulation of certain proteins that partici - pate in signal transduction . Molecular Chaperone Function of Hip Is Hip itself a molecular chaperone ? Hsp60 , DnaJ , and Hsp90 have been defined as molecular chaperones by virtue of their ability to prevent the aggregation of unfolded polypeptide ( Langer et al . , 1992 ; Wiech et al . , 1992 ) . Mito - chondrial rhodanese , used as a model protein in such stud - ies , aggregates rapidly upon dilution from denaturant , and only a minor portion of the protein reaches the native state spontaneously . A 5 - fold molar excess of Hip oligomer pre - vented aggregation of rhodanese almost completely in an ATP - independent manner , whereas catalase , a control protein of similar oligomericstructure , was ineffective ( Fig - ure 5 ) . While an interaction with native rhodanese was not ob - served , Hip formed a stable complex with unfolded rho - danese that could be isolated by high pressure liquid chro - matography gel filtration ( data not shown ) .

Hip Is Part of Chaperone Complexes with Newly Translated Polypeptides ( A ) Coimmunoprecipitation of chaperone complexes from ATP - depleted rabbit reticulocyte lysate . After incubation at 30°C for 20 min and subsequent apyrase treatment , the lysate was incubated either with immobilized preimmune IgGs , affinity - purified anti - Hip , or anti - Hsp70 antibodies ( see Experimental Procedures ) . Coprecipitated pro - teins were identified by immunoblotting . ( B ) Coimmunoprecipitation of in vitro translated , incomplete chains of firefly luciferase ( top ) and of full - length pp60”” ( bottom ) . Luciferase and pp60v - src mRNAs weretranslated in the presence of rS ] methionine for 20 and 30 min at 30°C , respectively . Prior to immunoprecipitation as above , the lysate was treated with apyrase and 2 mM puromycin was added . Radiolabeled polypeptides were analyzed by by SDS - PAGE and fluorography . oligomer , fractionation of the resulting complex was indis - tinguishable from that of Hip alone , suggesting that one Hip oligomer bound no more than one molecule of rho - danese . Unfolded luciferase was also found to associate with Hip ( data not shown ) . Thus , Hip possesses the basic properties of molecular chaperones , namely the ability to discriminate between nonnative and native protein struc - ture and to prevent off - pathway folding reactions such as aggregation . Hip may interact directly with newly trans - Ch & acterization of the Hsc70 Interacting Protein Hip Cat , rho / 5 : r rho 4 : 1 5 : 1 0 2 4 8 10 Time ( in ) Figure 5 . Interaction of Hip with Unfolded Polypeptide Hip prevents the aggregation of unfolded rhodanese upon dilution from denaturant . Aggregation was measured by following turbidity at 320 nm after IOO - fold dilution of denatured rhodanese into 20 mM MOPS ( pH 7 . 2 ) 50 mM KCI , 2 mM MgCI , . When indicated , the reac - tions contained a l - to 5 - fold molar excess of Hip oligomer ( Hip ) and a 5 . fold excess of tetrameric catalase ( cat ) over denatured rhodanese ( rho ) . lated polypeptides as part of a larger chaperone complex ( see above ) . In Vitro Formation of the Hip - Hsc70 Complex To gain insight into the interaction of Hip , Hsc70 , and Hsp40 , in vitro reconstitution experiments were per - formed . Formation of protein complexes with tg - Hip was analyzed by monitoring their retention on Ni” + - NTA aga - rose . We first established that Hip has an affinity for the ATPase domain of Hsc70 , generated by chymotryptic di - gestion of Hsc70 ( Chappell et al . , 1987 ) . Following incuba - tion of partially digested Hsc70 with tg - Hip in the absence of nucleotide , the 44 kDa ATPase domain was specifically retained on Ni’ + - NTA agarose ( Figure 6A ) , confirming the result of the two - hybrid screen . Surprisingly , retention of full - length Hsc70 and of a - 60 kDa fragment , comprising the ATPase domain and part of the carboxy - terminal do - main , was not observed in this experiment . Efficient recog - nition of full - length Hsc70 by Hip was dependent on a preincubation of the proteins with Mg - ATP and Hsp40 followed by washes with buffer lacking nucleotide . Under these conditions , - 2 mol of Hsc70 and substoichiometric amounts of Hsp40 were retained in a complex with Hip , whereas only minor amounts of Hsc70 were retained in the absence of Hsp40 ( Figures 6B and 6C ) . Direct binding of Hsp40 to Hip was not observed , suggesting that the effect of Hsp40 is mediated via its interaction with Hsc70 . Hsp40 - independent formation of Hip - Hsc70 complexes occurred with relatively high efficiency when the proteins were preincubated with ADP ; the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMP - PNP supported only a reduced level of Hsc70 binding ( Figure 6C ) . Binding of unfolded a - lac - talbumin to Hsc70 ( Palleros et al . , 1991 ) did not prevent the interaction between Hip and Hsc70 ( data not shown ) . Thus , substrate polypeptide and Hip bind to different re - gions of Hsc70 . Hip - Hsc70 complexes , formed by incubat - ing Hip with a molar excess of Hsc70 in the presence of Hsp40 and Mg - ATP , eluted from a sizing column with a molecular mass of 300 - 400 kDa , consistent with the bind - ing of two or more Hsc70 molecules per Hip oligomer ( data not shown ) . These complexes were only observed when the column was equilibrated with buffer lacking ATP , re - flecting the transient nature of the Hip - Hsc70 interaction in the presence of the nucleotide . Effects of Hip on Nucleotide Binding by Hsc70 These results suggested a model in which Hsp40 modu - lates the conformation of Hsc70 such that its ATP - binding domain becomes accessible for Hip . Given the nucleotide dependence of the reaction , this step would be predicted to involve ATP hydrolysis by Hsc70 . Hsp40 was shown to stimulate the slow ATPase activity of Hsc70 by about lo - fold ( Figure 6D ) . Hip itself had no detectable ATP hy - drolytic actvity and did not modulate the Hsc70 ATPase independently of the presence of Hsp40 . However , Hip had a significant effect on the nucleotide - bound state of Hsc70 . This was shown by thin layer chromatography analysis of Hsc70 - bound nucleotide after rapid removal of free [ a - 32P ] ATP by gel filtration ( Figure 6D ) . Consistent with its slow ATPase , unstimulated Hsc70 was mostly in the ATP - bound state whether Hip was present or not . When preincubated with Hsp40 , only about 60 % of Hsc70 was in the ATP state , reflecting ongoing ATP hydrolysis . Interestingly , when Hip was also present , the ADP - bound state of Hsc70 was significantly favored over the ATP - bound form ( Figure 6D ) . Since Hip did not reduce the Hsp40 - activated ATPase of Hsc70 , we conclude that ATP hydrolysis and not the dissociation of ADP is the rate - limiting step in the overall Hsc70 ATPase cycle . Thus , in the presence of Hip and Hsp40 , Hsc70 apparently spends more time in the ADP - bound state , which interacts most stably with unfolded substrate protein ( Palleros et al . , 1991 ) . Cooperation of Hip with Hsc70 / Hsp40 in Protein Folding The E . coli Hsp70 system consisting of DnaK , DnaJ , and GrpE has previously been shown to mediate the ATP - dependent refolding of denatured firefly luciferase in vitro ( Szabo et al . , 1994 ) . Compared with the three components of the bacterial Hsp70 system , mammalian Hsc70 and the DnaJ homolog Hsp40 were less efficient in mediating the refolding of luciferase ( Figure 7 , columns 1 and 2 ) . How - ever , when unfolded luciferase wasdiluted into buffer con - taining a mixture of Hsc70 , Hsp40 , and Hip , renaturation up to 60 % was observed ( Figure 7 ) , occurring with a half - time of 20 - 30 min ( data not shown ) . Under the experimen - tal conditions , efficient renaturation required all three pro - teins and was dependent on the presence of hydrolyzable ATP ( Figure 7 , columns 3 and 4 ) . The control protein cata - lase could not substitute for Hip . The molar ratio of Hsc70 to luciferase required for renaturation was 5 to lo - fold higher than that of DnaK in the bacterial chaperone system ( Szabo et al . , 1994 ) . This may be due to the fact that the maximal turnover number of the Hsc70 ATPase in the presence of Hsp40 is about 1 O - fold lower than that of DnaK upon stimulation by DnaJ and GrpE ( Liberek et al . , 1991 ) ( Figure 6D ) . Interestingly , the rate of polypeptide elonga - tion on eukaryotic ribosomes is also approximately 5 - to Cell 594 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Hsc70 + + + + + + Hsp40 + + + + + Hip + + CL + + ATP - + - + + + + tg - Hip + + + Hsc70 - + + Hsp40 + - + C 100 E 60 : : zc n 60 z . - g 40 z 20 0 AMP - PNP ADP ATP ADP ATP Hsc70 + + + + HqslLl - + - + Hip - - + + ADP / ATP 0 . 12 0 . 67 0 . 35 1 . 60 ATP - turnover ( mlrrq 0 . 16 1 . 67 0 . 10 1 . 66 Figure 6 . In Vitro Reconstitution of Hsc70 - Hsp40 - Hip Complexes and Effects of Hip and Hsp40 on the ATPase of Hsc70 ( A ) Hip binds to the 44 kDa ATPase domain of Hsc70 . Purified Hsc70 was partially digested with a - chymotrypsin to generate the ATPase domain . Protease activity was inhibited by addition of 1 mM PMSF , and 0 . 6 CM tg - Hip oligomer was incubated with the partially digested protein ( corresponding to 2 . 5 nM Hsc70 ) in buffer A for 30 min at 4°C ( see Experimental Procedures ) . The Q - Hip complexes were purified on Ni * + - NTA agarose .

( C ) Formation of the Hip - Hsc70 complex in the presence of ATP is dependent on Hsp40 . Complex formation was analyzed as described in ( B ) after incubation in the presence of 1 mM AMP - PNP , ADP , or ATP as indicated . Binding of Hsc70 to Hip in the presence of ATP and Hsp40 is set to 100 % . Figure 7 . Hip Increases the Efficiency of Hsc70 / Hsp40 - Mediated Re - folding of Firefly Luciferase Denatured firefly luciferase ( IO KM ) was diluted 1 OO - fold into refolding buffer containing Hip , Hsc70 , Hsp40 , or catalase ( 3 KM , 5 FM , 5 PM , and 3 PM final concentrations , respectively ) in the presence or ab - senceof 2 mM ATP . Luciferaseactivities weredetermined after incuba - tion for 60 min at 30°C and are expressed as percentage of a native enzyme control . Spontaneous renaturation of luciferase upon dilution into buffer lacking chaperone proteins was about 5 % . lo - fold slower than translation in the bacterial cytosol ( Lewin , 1990 ) . The activity of Hip to support ATP - depen - dent refolding was optimal at a molar ratio of Hip oligomer : Hsc70 : Hsp40 of approximately 1 : 4 : 4 ( data not shown ) . We propose that Hip increases the efficiency of the Hsc70 / Hsp40 system in this protein refolding reaction through both its ability to stabilize the unfolded polypeptide and to modulate the nucleotide - bound state of Hsc70 . Discussion A two - hybrid screen for Hsc70 - interacting proteins identi - fied a rat liver cDNA encoding Hip , a cytosolic protein that is likely to participate in many aspects of Hsc70 function . Formation of a Hip - Hsc70 complex is mediated by the ATPase domain of Hsc70 and is dependent on ATP hydro - lysis and the DnaJ homolog Hsp40 . Hip associates with translating polypeptide chains and appears to cooperate in the biogenesis and perhaps conformational regulation of certain signaling molecules , known to interact with Hsc70 and Hsp90 . In vitro reconstitution of the Hsc70 / Hsp40 / Hip chaper - one system allowed us to propose a model for the Hsp70 reaction cycle in the eukaryotic cytosol ( Figure 8 ) . In the ( D ) Hip stabilizes the ADP - bound state of Hsc70 without affecting the rate of ATP hydrolysis . Hsc70 ( 1 wM ) was incubated with 100 PM [ c ( - 3ZP ] ATP for 10 min at 30 % . When indicated , 1 uM Hsp40 and 2 FM Hipoligomerwerepresentduringincubation . Sampleswerecooled on ice , and free nucleotide was rapidly removed on a Nick column at 4 % . Bound nucleotide was determined by autoradiography after thin layer chromatography of eluted protein fractions . The ratios of ADP : ATP bound to Hsc70 were determined by densitometry . Values given are based on three independent measurements . Effects of Hip and Hsp40 on the steady - state ATPase activity of Hsc70 were determined by measuring free phosphate after incubation of 1 uM Hsc70 with 1 mM [ Y - ~ ~ P ] ATP at 37 % in the presence of 2 uM Hsp40 and 2 PM Hip oligomer ( see Experimental Procedures ) . C & racterization of the Hsc70 Interacting Protein Hip has been shown to facilitate the transfer of newly syn - thesized polypeptides to the large oligomeric chaper - onin TRiC for folding to the native state ( Frydman et al . , 1994 ) . In another reaction , Hsc70 - bound pp60v”” associ - ates with Hsp90 in a process that is dependent on ATP and DnaJ homologs ( Hutchinson et al . , 1992 ; Kimura et al . , 1995 ) . The Hsc70 / Hsp40 / Hip reaction cycle is distinct from the GrpE - dependent regulation of Hsp70 in the bacterial cyto - sol ( Szabo et al . , 1994 ) . In the eukaryotic system , the for - mation and dissociation of the chaperone - substrate com - plex is regulated via the effect of Hip to stabilize the intrinsically labile interaction between unfolded polypep - tide , Hsc70 , and Hsp40 . In contrast , in the prokaryotic system , GrpE is required to dissociate an otherwise stable complex of substrate polypeptide with DnaK and DnaJ . Differences between Hsc70 and DnaK in their interaction with nucleotide and with their respective DnaJ proteins may explain the different modes of regulation . E . coli DnaJ alone does not efficiently activate the steady - state rate of ATP hydrolysis by DnaK ( Liberek et al . , 1991 ) . After an initial round of accelerated hydrolysis , DnaK reaches a relatively stable ADP state . GrpE is then required to cata - lyze ADP dissociation , resulting in the full stimulation of the ATPase by 50 - fold or more ( Liberek et al . , 1991 ; Szabo et al . , 1994 ) . In contrast , Hsp40 alone is able to stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsc70 up to IO - fold ( see Figure 6D ) . It thus appears that ADP dissociation is not a rate - limiting step in the Hsc70 ATPase cycle , supporting the view that the eukaryotic proteins are regulated differently from bac - terial DnaK ( Ziegelhoffer et al . , 1995 ) . While our results do not exclude the existence of a GrpE - like factor in the eukaryotic cytosol , such a factor seems to be dispensable for the function of the Hsc70 / Hsp40 / Hip system . This is further suggested by the observation that the three pro - teins can cooperate in mediating the ATP - dependent rena - turation of unfolded luciferase in vitro , a reaction that has previously been demonstrated for E . coli DnaK , DnaJ , and GrpE ( see Figure 7 ; Szabo et al . , 1994 ) . The apparent independence of Hsc70 from a GrpE - like factor may have evolved in conjunction with the slower speed of translation on eukaryotic ribosomes . The slower rate of Hsp70 cy - cling , reached through activation of the Hsc70 ATPase by Hsp40 alone , and the functional cooperation of Hsc70 with Hip may provide for optimal stabilization of translating polypeptide chains in the eukaryotic cytosol . In addition to its role as a regulator of Hsc70 , Hip appar - ently possesses an ATP - independent molecular chaper - one activity ( see Figure 5 ) . A similar activity has also been reported for various DnaJ homologs ( Langer et al . , 1992 ; Cyr et al . , 1994 ) . While it seems unlikely that in vivo these proteins act independently of Hsp70 , their chaperone function may contribute to the stabilization of unfolded polypeptide substrates interacting with Hsp70 . The oligo - merit structure of Hip may be of significance in this re - spect . The Hip oligomer , acting as a scaffolding protein , may hold multiple Hsc70 molecules in close proximity to the unfolded polypeptide chain . Under in vitro conditions , at least two molecules of Hsc70 assembled on a Hip oligo - Hsc70 Hsp40 , - - - , N ATP ADP Hip Figure 8 .

In this model , Hip is assumed to be a tetramer ( for details see Discussion ) . absence of Hsp40 and Hip , Hsc70 is predominantly in the ATP - bound form , as the intrinsic ATPase of Hsc70 is slow . The ATP state of Hsp70 proteins is characterized by both high on and off rates for peptide binding ( Schmid et al . , 1994 ) so that , in the presence of ATP , Hsc70 alone does not form a stable complex with peptide substrate ( Palleros et al . , 1991 , 1993 ) . In contrast , the ADP - bound form of Hsc70 binds peptide stably but with a slow on rate . As shown here , Hsp40 stimulates the intrinsic ATPase of Hsc70 ( see Figure 6D ) . Hence , Hsp40 can facilitate the binding of unfolded polypeptide to Hsc70 , which is re - flected in the requirement of Hsp40 for the association of Hsc70 with translating polypeptidechains ( Frydman et al . , 1994 ) . However , in the presence of Hsp40 alone , the ADP state of Hsc70 is labile , resulting in premature dissociation of the Hsc70 - substrate complex . Hip , by interacting with the ATPase domain of Hsc70 , stabilizes the ADP state ( see Figure 6D ) . Formation of the Hip - Hsc70 complex can occur in the presence of ADP , but is most efficient upon Hsp40 - induced ATP hydrolysis by Hsc70 ( see Figures 6B and 6C ) . The Hip - Hsc70 - substrate complex eventually dissociates upon spontaneous ADP release and subse - quent ATP binding to Hsc70 ( Figure 8 ) . By this mecha - nism , Hip would prolong the time window during which Hsc70 interacts stably with unfolded polypeptide and in vivo may support the efficient cooperation of the Hsp70 system with downstream chaperones . For example , Hsc70 Cell 596 mer ( see Figure 6B ) . At the same time , the Hip - Hsc70 complex is able to interact with downstream chaperone proteins such as Hsp90 ( see Figures 3 and 4 ) . Although it remains to be determined whether Hip functions as a coupling factor between Hsc70 and Hsp90 , these results further suggest a role for Hip in promoting the assembly of multifunctional chaperone complexes . The identifica - tion of Hip as a TPR protein and its homology to yeast Stilp , a partner protein of Hsp70 , Hsp90 , and immunophi - lins in the cytosol ( Smith et al . , 1993 ; Chang and Lindquist , 1994 ) , would be consistent with such a function . Indeed , after submitting this manuscript , we learned that the amino acid sequence of p48 of the human progesterone recep - tor - Hsp90 complex is 90 . 5 % identical to that of rat Hip ( GenBank accession number U28918 ) . The identification of p48 as the human Hip homolog supports our conclu - sions regarding the function of Hip . Experimental Procedures Plasmid Construction and Library Screening All experiments were performed using the yeast strain HF7c ( MATa , ura3 - 52 , hi & ZOO , IysZ - 801 , ade2 - 101 , trpl - 901 , / euZ - 3 , 112 , ga / 4 - 542 , ga180538 , LYSP : : GAL7 - HIS3 , URA3 : : ( GAL4 17 - mers ) S - CYCl - / acZ ) . Yeast were grown in YPD or SD minimal medium ( Ausubel et al . , 1969 ) . A PET - hsc70 plasmid ( Shi and Thomas , 1992 ) containing the entire rat hsc70 cDNA sequence ( Sorger and Pelham , 1987 ) was cut at a Ndel site covering the ATG start codon . The Ndel site was converted to a blunt end , and subsequent digestion with Hindlll resulted in the formation of an hsc70 fragment encoding amino acids l - 133 . A frag - ment encoding residues 133 - 383 was obtained by PCR using PET - hsc70 as template . During the PCR reaction , a stop codon and a Sall site were introduced following codon 383 . The product of the PCR reaction was digested with Hindlll and Sal1 and , together with the fragment encoding residues 1 - 133 , subcloned into Smal - Sall - di - gested pGBT9 ( Bartel et al . , 1993 ) . The resulting construct GAL4 ( bd ) - Hsc70 ( 1 - 383 ) was introduced into yeast strain HF7c , and Trp + trans - formants were cotransformed with a rat IivercDNA library that contains 3 . 0 x 1 O6 independent clones and is based on the LEU2 marker plas - mid pGADl0 ( Bartel et al . , 1993 ) ( CLONTECH Laboratory ) . Owing to HIS3 as reporter gene in strain HF7c , transformants were screened for histidine prototrophy on SD , - His , - Leu , - Trp minimal plates for 7 days . His + , Leu + , Trp’ transformants were isolated , grown in SD medium lacking leucine , and replated on the same medium . Replica plating on SD , - His and SD , - Trp was performed to identify colonies that had lost their ability to grow on histidine - free medium based on the loss of plasmid GAL4 ( bd ) - Hsc70 ( 1 - 383 ) . These colonies were as - sayed for b - galactosidase activity , and their activation domain ( ad ) plasmids were isolated ( Ausubel et al . , 1989 ) . The ad plasmids were individually reintroduced into yeast HF7c and the same strain con - taining GAL4 ( bd ) - Hsc70 ( 1 - 383 ) and rescreened for histidine proto - trophy . The cDNA fragments of plasmids encoding putative Hsc70 - interacting proteins were sequenced in both directions using Seque - nase ( United States Biochemical Corporation ) . Sequence alignments were performed using PILEUP ( Genetics Computer Group ) . The BLAST program ( Altschul et al . , 1990 ) was used to search for homolo - gous proteins in the database . Internal repeats were identified by dot matrix analysis . Expression of Hip and Antibody Production A PET - 3a vector ( Novagen Incorporated ) was used for the expression of a tagged version of Hip in E . coli & g - Hip ) , allowing the carboxy - terminal introduction of a Gly - Ser - Myc - Hiss tag ( pMS / MycHis , S ( gaard et al . , 1994 ) . The coding region of hip was subcloned into the Ndel - BamHI - digested pET vector after generation of an Ndel site containing the ATG start codon of Hip . The Ndel site was introduced by PCR using GAL4 ( ad ) - Hip as template . During the same PCR reac - tion , the BamHl site at position + 2 was destroyed by changing T at position + 6 to A , and a Bglll site was introduced at position + I 105 . A plasmid that encodes a truncated version of Hip consisting of amino acids i - 274 and containing a carboxy - terminal Gly - Ser - Hiss tag was engineered by PCR . BL21 ( DE3 ) cells harboring the appropriate plasmids were cultured at 37OC in LB medium with ampicillin , expression was induced by addition of IPTG to 1 mM at an ODsoo of 0 . 2 , and the cells were further incubated for 3 hr . Cells were lysed in 20 mM Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 100 mM NaCI , 5 mM P - ME , 20 mM imidazole , 1 mM PMSF , using a French pressure cell . The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 25 , 000 x g for 20 min , and tg - Hip was purified from the supernatant on 5 ml Ni * + - NTA agarose columns ( QIAGEN ) following standard procedures . Polyclonal antibodies against tg - Hip were raised in rabbits and affin - ity purified using bacterially expressed truncated Hip ( amino acids l - 274 ) immobilized on Affi - Gel 10 ( Bio - Rad ) . The purified antibody did not react with unrelated Hiss - tagged proteins . The percentage of Hip present in total rat brain homogenate was estimated by quantitative immunoblotting ( ECL system , Amersham ) using the affinity - purified antibody and purified tg - Hip as a standard . Tissue Preparation and Cell Cultures Beef liver was homogenized in 2 vol of 25 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 50 mM NaCI , 1 mM DTT , 1 mM PMSF , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 6 M sorbitol , using a Potter S homogenizer ( Braun Biotech ) . The homogenate was centri - fuged at 3 , 000 x g for 10 min , and the resultant supernatant was centrifuged at 25 , 000 x g for 20 min . Rat brain homogenate ( 10 mg of protein / ml ) was prepared in 5 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 320 mM sucrose using a Dounce homogenizer . Radiolabeled CHO cell extracts were obtainedaccordingto Harlowand Lane ( 1988 ) . Thecellswere homoge - nized in 4 vol of 20 mM HEPES ( pH 7 . 4 ) , 80 mM KCI , 5 mM MgClz , 1 mM PMSF using a Dounce homogenizer . The homogenate was centrifuged at 15 , 000 x g for 15 min , and the supernatant fraction was used as CHO cell extract . Gel Filtration Following centrifugation at 100 , 000 x g for 20 min , soluble beef liver extracts were subjected to gel filtration on a Superose 12 column ( Pharmacia ) equilibrated in 20 mM MOPS ( pH 7 . 2 ) , 50 mM KC \ , 2 mM MgC & , 1 mM PMSF , 10 % glycerol . When indicated , the extract ( 200 @ I at 23 mg of protein / ml ) was preincubated with 1 mM ATP at 30 % for 15 min , followed by incubation with 10 U / ml apyrase on ice for 15 min and centrifugation as above . Affinity Chromatography on Immobilized tg - Hip Beef liver extract ( S25 ) was fractionated on a DE52 column ( Whatman ) in 20 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 8 ) , 1 mM EDTA , 1 mM P - ME , 1 mM PMSF to remove hemoglobin that bound unspecifically to NV + - NTA agarose . The 300 mM NaCl eluate was loaded onto a NAP - IO column ( Phar - macia ) equilibrated in 20 mM MOPS ( pH 7 . 2 ) , 50 mM KCI , 2 mM MgCI , , 20 mM imidazole , 1 mM PMSF , 2 mglml aprotinin , 0 . 5 mg / ml leupeptin ( bufferA ) . The extract was precleared by incubation with 100 pl of Ni2 + - NTA agarose per ml extract followed by centrifugation at 15 , 000 x g for 5 min . Tg - Hip was added to the supernatant ( 0 . 3 mglml final concentration ) , and the sample was incubated at 30°C for 15 min in the presence of 1 mM ATP . After cooling on ice , 10 U / ml apyrase and 30 pl of Ni2 + - NTA agarose were added , and the sample was rotated at 4 % for 30 min . Agarose beads were washed with 100 voi of buffer A , and bound proteins were eluted by rotation for 10 min at room temperature in 30 vol of buffer A , 50 pM ATP . Retained proteins were identified by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal anti - Hsp70 and anti - Hsp40 and a monoclonal anti - Hsp90 antibody ( Stressgen ) . lmmunoprecipitation lmmunoprecipitations were performed using antibodies cross - linked to protein A - Sepharose fast flow ( Pharmacia ) at a concentration of 1 mg of protein per ml beads . lmmunoprecipitation of Hip from radiola - beled CHO cell extracts was performed by adding 10 pg of affinity - purified and immobilized anti - Hip antibody to 100 ~ 1 of CHOcell extract ( 15 mg of protein / ml ) ( Harlow and Lane , 1988 ) . The extract was rotated for 1 hr at 4 % . Antibody - coupled protein A - Sepharose beads were washed three times with 30 vol of IO mM Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 150 mM NaCI , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , and three times with 10 mM Tris ( pH 8 . 0 ) , 500 mM $ ; yterization of the Hsc70 Interacting Protein Hip NaCI , before elution of bound antigen with 200 ul of 0 . 1 M glycine ( pH 2 . 5 ) . Coimmunoprecipitation of Hip - containing protein complexes was performed from rabbit reticulocyte lysate ( Promega ) used to translate firefly luciferase and pp60v”‘c mRNA . Translations were performed at 30 % and were stopped by adding 1 U / l00 ul apyrase and 2 mM puromycinfollowed byincubationon icefor20minAftercentrifugation for 15 min at 15 , 000 x g , 10 ul of antibody - coupled protein A - Sepha - rose was added to 20 ul of the resultant supernatant fraction followed by rotation for 1 hr at 4 % . Beads were washed four times with 30 vol of 20 mM MOPS ( pH 7 . 2 ) , 50 mM KCI , IO mM sodium molybdate , 2 mM MgCI , , 10 % glycerol , and once with the same buffer containing 0 . 05 % Triton X - l 00 . Bound protein was eluted in SDS buffer and ana - lyzed by SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting using a polyclonal anti - Hsp40antibodyand monocional anti - Hsp70andanti - HspgOantibodies ( Stressgen ) . Rhodanese Aggregation and Luciferase Refolding Assay Bovine rhodanese ( Langer et al . , 1992 ) was denatured at 50 uM in 6 M guanidinium - HCI , 30 mM Tris ( pH 7 . 4 ) 10 mM DTT at 25 % for 1 hr . The unfolded protein was diluted lOO - fold into 20 mM MOPS ( pH 7 . 2 ) 50 mM KCI , 2 mM MgCI , , containing 0 . 5 - 2 . 5 uM Hip oligomer ( assuming a tetrameric structure ) or 2 . 5 uM catalase tetramer as indi - cated . Aggregation was assayed by measuring turbidity at 320 nm . Firefly luciferase ( Sigma ) was denatured at 10 uM as described for rhodanese , but in the presence of 2 mM DTT . For refolding assays , unfolded luciferase was diluted lOO - fold into 10 mM MOPS ( pH 7 . 2 ) 50 mM KCI , 3 mM MgCl * , 2 mM DTT containing 3 uM Hip oligomer , 5 uM Hsp70 , 5 uM Hsp40 and 2 mM ATP when indicated . Luciferase activities were measured after 60 min incubation at 30 % ( Promega ) . Reconstitution of tg - Hip - Hsc70 Complexes Hsc70was purified from bovine brain ( Schlossman et al . , 1984 ) . Hsp40 ( Ohtsuka , 1993 ) was expressed in E . coli and subsequently purified ( Y . M . , unpublished data ) . Tg - Hip oligomer was incubated for 15 min at 30°C with purified Hsc70 and Hsp40 ( 2 . 5 uM each ) in buffer A with or without 1 mM ATP . Following addition of 1110 vol of Ni’ + - NTA agarose , the samples were further incubated for 30 min at 4 % . After washing with 100 vol of buffer A , bound protein was eluted with 3 vol of buffer A , 150 mM imidazole . The ATPase domain of Hsc70 was generated by chymotryptic digestion ( Chappell et al . , 1987 ) . Analysis of Hsc70 ATPase Activity Hsc70 ATPase was assayed as described ( Sadis and Hightower , 1992 ) . The nucleotide - bound state of Hsc70 was analyzed after incuba - tion of 1 uM Hsc70 with 2 PM tg - Hip and 1 uM Hsp40 in 20 mM MOPS ( pH 7 . 2 ) 50 mM KCI , 2 mM MgCI , , 100 uM [ 03’P ] ATP ( 20 mCi / mmol ) for 10 min at 30 % . Free nucleotide was separated on a Nick column ( Pharmacia ) equilibrated at4OC in the same buffer lacking ATP . Bound nucleotide was detected by thin layer chromatography ( Liberek et al . , 1991 ) .
