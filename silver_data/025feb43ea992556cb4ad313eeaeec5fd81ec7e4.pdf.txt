This polarization process is characterized by a hierarchy of steps . First , the site on the cell surface is selected by intrinsic and extrinsic cues . This site is marked by the deposition of land - mark proteins . Second , cell polarity is established by the activa - tion of small GTPases with CDC42 as the major player . Last , a multiprotein machine is assembled that spools out actin cables to direct post - Golgi traffi c to the site of polarized cell growth ( Drubin and Nelson , 1996 ; Madden and Snyder , 1998 ; Pruyne and Bretscher , 2000 ; Chang and Peter , 2003 ) . During budding , membrane traffi c is directed by actin cables to the bud , and the septin ring at mother - daughter cell neck region functions as a physical barrier , preventing diffu - sion of membrane components from the bud to the mother cell ( Barral et al . , 2000 ; Takizawa et al . , 2000 ) . During mating , the biosynthetic transport is directed to the shmoo tip ( Pruyne and Bretscher , 2000 ) . However , there is no diffusion barrier like the septin ring and most proteins diffuse laterally over the entire cell surface . Nevertheless , a specifi c subset of proteins required for mating is clustered at the tip of the mating projection . We have shown previously that the polarized distribution of membrane components involves raft lipids ( sphingolipids and ergosterol ) and the actin cytoskeleton ( Bagnat and Simons , 2002 ) . Based on these observations , we proposed that lipid rafts are clus - tered at the tip of the mating projection and that this process is important for the retention of the associated molecules at the mating projection . Recently , it was demonstrated that cycles of endocytosis combined with polarized membrane delivery into the mating projection are able to restrict protein localiza - tion to the tips of shmoos ( Valdez - Taubas and Pelham , 2003 ) . Here , we report that polarized localization of Fus1p , a type I transmembrane protein involved in cell fusion ( Trueheart and Fink , 1989 ) , does not require endocytosis . Instead , the protein is retained at the tip of the mating projection through the in - teraction of its cytosolic tail with a multiprotein scaffolding machinery . Additionally , we provide evidence that the lipid bi - layer at the tip of the mating projection is more ordered than over the cell body and that sphingolipids are required for this specifi c lipid organization . Results and discussion To revisit the kinetic recycling model we have analyzed the role of polarized delivery and endocytosis in polarizing Fus1p , a type I transmembrane protein involved in cell fusion ( Trueheart and Fink , 1989 ; Nolan et al . , 2006 ) , to the tip of the mating pro - jection . We fi rst analyzed shmoo tip delivery of Fus1p and com - pared it to another marker protein that is distributed all over the Plasma membrane polarization during mating in yeast cells Tomasz J . Proszynski , Robin Klemm , Michel Bagnat , Katharina Gaus , and Kai Simons Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics , 01307 Dresden , Germany T he yeast mating cell provides a simple paradigm for analyzing mechanisms underlying the generation of surface polarity . Endocytic recycling and slow diffu - sion on the plasma membrane were shown to facilitate polarized surface distribution of Snc1p ( Valdez - Taubas , J . , and H . R . Pelham . 2003 . Curr . Biol . 13 : 1636 – 1640 ) . Here , we found that polarization of Fus1p , a raft - associated type I transmembrane protein involved in cell fusion , does not depend on endocytosis . Instead , Fus1p localization to the tip of the mating projection was determined by its cytosolic domain , which binds to peripheral proteins involved in mating tip polarization . Furthermore , we pro - vide evidence that the lipid bilayer at the mating projec - tion is more condensed than the plasma membrane enclosing the cell body , and that sphingolipids are re - quired for this lipid organization .

Mid2p is a cell wall integrity sensor , and similarly to Fus1p , it is a type I transmembrane protein ( Philip and Levin , 2001 ) . 1 h after in - duction of expression , the marker proteins were delivered to the shmoo tip where both were localized at this point . However , 2 h later Mid2p had diffused over the entire plasma membrane , whereas Fus1p remained at the tip . We then analyzed the effect of endocytosis on the process of Fus1p polarization . We also used Snc1p , a yeast v - SNARE involved in post - Golgi plasma membrane transport , as a second marker protein that is tip localized . It has been shown that Snc1p polarization was abolished after inhibition of endocytosis ( Valdez - Taubas and Pelham , 2003 ) . In endocytosis - defi cient cells , Snc1p was no longer polarized but was distributed over the plasma membrane of the shmooing cells . In contrast , the polarization of Fus1p to the tip of the mating projection remained normal in end4 ∆ cells ( Fig . 2 ) . Thus , there must be an alternative mechanism that maintains biosynthetically delivered Fus1p at the shmoo tip irrespective of ongoing cycles of endocytosis and exocytosis . Important also to note is that most mutants that inhibit endocytosis mate with similar effi ciency as wild - type cells ( Brizzio et al . , 1998 ) . These fi ndings confi rm that the kinetic polarization model using endo - cytosis and polarized exocytosis is involved in local concentra - tion of membrane proteins such as Snc1p . However , this is not the only mechanism used by shmooing cells to polarize their mating machinery . One reason why Fus1p is retained at the mating tip could be due to interaction with the cell wall , as was demonstrated for glycosylphosphatidylinositol - anchored proteins ( De Sampaio et al . , 1999 ) . Thus , we constructed fusion proteins between Fus1p and Mid2p where we swapped the extracellular , the transmembrane , and the cytosolic domains of the two proteins ( schematically shown in Fig . 3 ) . Analysis of their surface distri - bution demonstrated that the information for mating tip reten - tion was localized to the cytosolic tail ( Fig . 3 ) . The Mid2 protein carrying the cytoplasmic domain from Fus1p was localized to the mating projection . PAGE and Western blot analysis con - fi rmed that this protein displayed a pattern of glycosylation , typical for mature Mid2p ( Lommel et al . , 2004 and unpublished data ) . We then analyzed how this chimeric protein behaved in mutants in which endocytosis was inhibited , both in end4 ∆ cells and at the nonpermissive temperature in end4 - 1 ts cells . This chimeric protein behaved like Fus1p and maintained its polariza - tion in endocytosis - defi cient cells ( Fig . 4 A and Fig . S1 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200602007 / DC1 ) . Thus , we concluded that the cytosolic tail of Fus1p mediates Figure 1 . Polarized exocytosis to the tip of the mating projection . Locali - zation of GFP - tagged Fus1p and Mid2p at different time points after induction of expression in shmooing cells . Wild - type cells carrying plasmids MBQ30 or MBQ35 were treated with α - factor for 3 h and after that , galactose was added to induce protein expression ( for details see Materials and methods ) . Figure 2 . Polarized distribution of Snc1p , but not of Fus1p , is dependent on endocytosis . Blocked endocytosis in end4 ∆ disrupted polarized distribution of Snc1p , but did not affect tip localization of Fus1p , compared with wild - type cells . The percentage of cells with ﬂ uorescence on the plasma membrane limited to the mating projection is given in the bottom right corner of the GFP images . For Fus1p in wild - type and end4 ∆ we counted 218 and 327 cells , re - spectively , and for Snc1p it was 220 and 100 cells , respectively . In wild - type cells , in addition to the plasma membrane , Snc1p was found in intracellular structures due to protein cycling . These structures were not visible in the endocytosis mutant because the protein was trapped on the plasma membrane . Fus1p in wild - type cells was found at the plasma membrane and in the vacuole . on M a y 29 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published June 12 , 2006 PLASMA MEMBRANE POLARIZATION DURING MATING IN YEAST • PROSZYNSKI ET AL . 863 protein retention at the tip and that interactions with the cell wall cannot explain the polarization . The cytosolic tail of Fus1p is 416 amino acids long and contains an Src kinase homology 3 ( SH3 ) domain close to its COOH terminus , followed by a proline - rich domain , both known to be responsible for protein – protein interactions ( Tong et al . , 2002 ) . We deleted the SH3 domain from the chimeric protein Mid - Fus ( used in Fig . 4 A ) or Fus1p ( not depicted ) and saw no effect on polarization . At this time , a report from Nelson et al . ( 2004 ) appeared , in which a detailed analysis of the cytoplasmic domain of Fus1p was described . They showed that both domains were important for mating effi - ciency , but even the double - mutant protein was polarized nor - mally in wild - type cells . Because mutations in these domains prevented protein interaction with the scaffolding machinery ( Nelson et al . , 2004 ) we considered the possibility that the dou - ble mutant of Fus1p could be polarized via the endocytic recy - cling mechanism . To test this possibility we expressed the mutated Fus1p in the endocytosis - defi cient strain and found that protein polarization was still normal ( Fig . 4 B ) . We concluded that additional sites on the cytoplasmic tail of Fus1p might con - tribute to Fus1p retention to the mating tip . In a detailed two - hybrid analysis it was demonstrated that the cytosolic tail of Fus1p interacts with several key players in mating polarity , in - cluding the GTP - bound form of CDC42 , components of the polarisome Pea2p and Bni1p , Fus2p , and Ste5p , the scaffold protein for MAP kinase signaling ( Nelson et al . , 2004 ) . We ana - lyzed the Mid - Fus protein in pea2 , bni1 , fus2 , spa2 , bud6 , fus1 , and ste5 deletion mutants . The localization was normal in all mutants accept in ste5 cells , which did not form shmoos and in bni1 , which exhibits a subtle defect in protein polarization ( Fig . S2 ) . From these data we propose that Fus1p is directly embedded in a dynamic network of protein – protein interactions that is re - sponsible for scaffolding and localization of Fus1 to the shmoo tip as part of the mating machinery . Based on the fi ndings ( 1 ) that polarization of the mating machinery to the shmoo tip is inhibited in erg6 and in lcb1 - 100 cells ; ( 2 ) that mutations that severely affect the synthesis of the major raft lipids in yeast reduced mating effi ciency ; and ( 3 ) on the polarized distribution of fi lipin , a molecule that has high affi nity for sterols , we postulated previously that raft lipid clus - tering plays a role in establishing and maintaining mating tip polarization ( Bagnat and Simons , 2002 ) . Because partitioning of fi lipin does not directly correlate with lipid ordering in the bilayer , we took advantage of a dye that does . Laurdan is an en - vironmentally sensitive dye that has a peak of emission shifting from (cid:4) 500 nm in liquid - disordered membranes to (cid:4) 440 nm in ordered membrane domains ( Gaus et al . , 2003 ) . We simultane - ously recorded the Laurdan fl uorescence intensity in two channels . By expressing a normalized ratio of the two emission regions— the general polarization ( GP ; see Materials and methods ) — Laurdan fl uorescence provides a relative measure of lipid order in cell membranes . Importantly , Laurdan does not preferentially partition into a specifi c lipid phase , nor do GP values depend on the local probe concentration within the membrane ( Gaus et al . , 2003 ) . The GP images revealed that the membrane at that mat - ing projection is more condensed and ordered than the domain Figure 3 . The cytoplasmic tail of Fus1p is responsible for polarized localization . Fus1p , Mid2p , and different chimeric proteins were expressed in wild - type cells treated with α - factor . The schematic representation of the expressed fusion proteins is shown on the right and the swapped domains are indicated . The yellow and red colors specify FUS1 and MID2 sequences , respectively . Internal membrane staining is seen in F and G , suggesting that protein sorting to the cell surface was compromised . However , the fraction of protein that was delivered to the plasma membrane was not polarized . on M a y 29 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published June 12 , 2006 JCB • VOLUME 173 • NUMBER 6 • 2006 864 on the opposite site of the cell ( Fig . 5 ) . Hence , the membrane at the mating projections displayed the biophysical characteristic that is expected for raft clustering . The coalescence of con - densed membrane at the tips of shmoos was also found to occur in the endocytosis - defi cient strain but not in the sphingolipid mutant lcb1 - 100 ( Fig . 5 ) . These data clearly demonstrated the asymmetric organization of the lipids in the plasma membrane of yeast cells during mating . More detailed analysis is needed to understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for the for - mation and maintenance of the mating projection . Also , mammalian cells use raft clustering to polarize their cell surfaces during cell migration or cell – cell contacting during immune recognition . In migrating neutrophils it was demon - strated that lipid raft clusters are localized to the rear of the cells in an actin - dependent manner ( Seveau et al . , 2001 ) . In migrat - ing T - lymphocytes , Gomez - Mouton et al . ( 2001 ) showed that two types of raft clusters are assembled at opposite poles , at the leading edge and at the uropod . Recently , it was also demon - strated that when the T cell receptor is activated , a condensed raft cluster is formed at the activation site ( Gaus et al . , 2005 ) . Each raft - clustering process is specifi c in that a subset of raft components is included in the assembly , associating and disas - sociating from the cluster dependent on their raft - partitioning characteristics ( Simons and Vaz , 2004 ; Kusumi et al . , 2005 ) and the kinetics of the protein – protein interactions ( Harder , 2004 ; Douglass and Vale , 2005 ) . This mechanism could also drive the surface polarization during yeast mating ( Bagnat and Simons , 2002 ) . The scaffolding of proteins would occur mainly through Figure 4 . Fus1p does not require its SH3 or the proline - rich domain for polarized localization . The chimeric Mid ( cyt - Fus ∆ SH3 ) protein , which carries a cyto plasmic tail from Fus1p without SH3 domain , was equally well polarized in the wild - type and end4 ∆ cells ( A ) . The percentage of cells with ﬂ uorescence on the plasma membrane limited to the mating projection is indicated ( n = 361 and 138 for the wild - type and end4 ∆ cells , respectively ) . Similarly , protein carrying point muta - tions that affect the function of the proline - rich region or the SH3 domain ( Fus1p ( P422A ) and Fus1p - SH3 ( W473S ) , respectively ) , or the double mutant of Fus1p ( Fus1p ( P422A ) - SH ( W473S ) ) , was polarized in end4 ∆ cells ( B ) . Figure 5 . Membrane condensation at the mating projection . α - Factor – treated wild - type ( A and D ) , lcb1 - 100 ( B and E ) , and end4 ∆ ( C and F ) cells were killed with 5 mM NaN 3 , ﬁ xed with 2 – 4 % paraformaldehyde , labeled with 250 μ M Laurdan for 5 min , and imaged in water . GP values were calculated from the Laurdan intensity images and pseudocolored as indicated in A ( low to high GP values , black to yellow ) . Bars in A – C = 2 μ m . GP values of membranes at the mating tip and at the cell body opposite the mating tip were measured for 40 ( D ) , 28 ( E ) , and 43 ( F ) individual cells . Horizontal bars in D – F indicate means . Means ± SD are 0 . 398 ± 0 . 118 and 0 . 191 ± 0 . 090 ( D ) , 0 . 256 ± 0 . 143 and 0 . 202 ± 0 . 104 ( E ) , and 0 . 372 ± 0 . 075 and 0 . 256 ± 0 . 111 ( F ) for mating tip and cell body , respectively . The dif - ference of the GP value at the mating projection between wild - type and sphingolipid mutant cells was statistically signiﬁ cant ( P < 0 . 001 ) but there was no statistically signiﬁ cant difference between wild - type and end4 cells ( P > 0 . 05 ) . on M a y 29 , 2017 D o w n l oaded f r o m Published June 12 , 2006 PLASMA MEMBRANE POLARIZATION DURING MATING IN YEAST • PROSZYNSKI ET AL . 865 protein – protein interactions . Nevertheless , coming together of proteins with a condensed lipid domain at the mating tip could lead to activation of the mating machinery spatially and tempo - rally by specifi c lipid – protein interactions ( Kalvodova et al . , 2005 ) . These interactions could involve integral proteins bind - ing to raft lipids in the bilayer . For instance , the EGF receptor has been shown to be activated by interactions with the ganglio - side Gd1a and the glutamate receptor by raft - cholesterol ( Eroglu et al . , 2003 ; Liu et al . , 2004 ) . Recently , it was demonstrated that yeast Ste5p , a protein that plays a crucial role in pheromone signaling and interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of Fus1p , has a phospholipid binding domain that is necessary for protein local - ization and signaling ( Winters et al . , 2005 ) . The generation of cell surface polarity during yeast mat - ing is thus a complex process involving on one hand endocyto - sis and recycling and on the other hand establishment of the site where the mating machinery is scaffolded and the membrane reorganized . It is our contention that complex membrane pro - cesses such as cell surface polarization are driven by protein – protein and protein – lipid interactions . However , only future work directed specifi cally toward analysis of these issues will unravel the mechanisms involved . Materials and methods Strains and growth conditions In this study the following yeast strains were used : RH690 - 15D [ wild - type ] ( Mata his4 , leu2 , ura3 , lys2 , bar1 ) was obtained from H . Riezman ( Univer - sity of Basel , Basel , Switzerland ) , and RH1965 [ end4 ∆ ] ( Mata his4 , leu2 , ura3 , lys2 , bar1 , end4 : : LEU2 ) and RH268 - 1 [ en4 - 1 ts ] ( Mata his4 , leu2 , ura3 , lys2 , bar1 , end4 - 1 ( ts ) ) were obtained from C . Walch - Solimena ( MPJ - CBG , Dresden , Germany ) . 1302 - WT ( BY4742 ) , pea2 , bni1 , fus2 , spa2 , bud6 , fus1 and ste5 deletions are in BY strains derived from S288C ( MATa ; his31 ; leu20 ; met150 ; ura30 ) and were obtained from EUROSCARF . Cells were grown overnight in yeast extract / peptone ( YP ) medium contain - ing 2 % rafﬁ nose ( YPRaf ) as a carbon source at 24 ° C . For the induction of expression from the GAL - S promoter , 2 % galactose was added . To induce a mating response , 5 μ M α - factor ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was added and cells were incubated for 3 h at 24 ° C ( or as indicated ) . Plasmids Plasmids used in this study are listed in Table I . All constructs created in our lab are based on the centromeric plasmid p416 ( Mumberg et al . , 1995 ) and expression was driven from the inducible GAL - S promoter . Plasmids p4269 , p4580 , and p4667 containing mutants of FUS1 under control of its own promoter were obtained from the C . Boone lab ( University of Toronto , Toronto , Canada ; Nelson et al . , 2004 ) . The plasmid containing GFP - SNC1 under control of constitutive TPI promoter was obtained from the H . Pelham lab ( MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology , Cambridge , UK ; Lewis et al . , 2000 ) . Construction of plasmids MBQ30 , MBQ35 , TPQ53 , and TPQ55 was described previously ( Bagnat and Simons , 2002 ; Proszynski et al . , 2004 , 2005 ) . Plasmids TPQ63 , TPQ65 , TPQ72 , and TPQ57 were created by triple ligation method , where two PCR - ampliﬁ ed fragments of DNA are introduced into a vector ( for details see Proszynski et al . , 2004 ) . To generate TPQ63 , a DNA fragment coding the extracellular do - main of Fus1p linked to the transmembrane domain ( TMD ) from Mid2p ( ampliﬁ ed from plasmid TPQ55 with primers containing XbaI and BamHI sites ) and a DNA fragment coding the cytoplasmic tail of Fus1p fused to GFP ( ampliﬁ ed from TPQ53 with primers containing BglII and HindIII sites ) were co - ligated to the MBQ1 vector digested with XbaI – HindIII . To create TPQ65 , a fragment of DNA coding the extracellular domain of Mid2p linked to the TMD from Fus1p ( ampliﬁ ed from plasmid TPQ53 with XbaI and BamHI sites added on the primers ) and a DNA fragment containing the cytoplasmic tail of Mid2p fused to GFP ( ampliﬁ ed from MBQ35 with BglII and HindIII sites added on the primers ) were coligated into MBQ1 ( XbaI – HindIII ) . To make TPQ72 , a DNA fragment coding the extracellular domain and TMD of Fus1p ( ampliﬁ ed from plasmid MBQ30 with primers containing XbaI and BamHI sites ) and a DNA fragment containing the cytoplasmic tail of Mid2p fused to GFP ( prepared as for TPQ65 ) were co - ligated to the XbaI – HindIII - digested vector MBQ1 . Plasmid TPQ57 was made by co - ligation of a DNA fragment coding GFP ( ﬂ anked by BamHI – HindIII sites ) with a DNA fragment coding the trun - cated ( SH3 ∆ ) version of Fus1p ( ampliﬁ ed from MBQ30 with praimers con - taining XbaI – BglII sites ) into the MBQ1 Vector ( XbaI – HindIII ) . Primers TPQ94 and TPQ97 were constructed by homologus recombi - nation in RH690 - 15D cells . To generate TPQ94 , a DNA fragment ( obtained from TPQ63 with BglII – HindIII digestion ) coding the TMD from MID2 and the cytoplasmic tail from FUS1 , followed by the GFP , was cotransformed with MBQ35 ( linearized with BamHI ) . To create TPQ97 , a DNA fragment coding the truncated cytoplasmic tail of Fus1p followed by the GFP coding sequence ( PCR ampliﬁ ed from TPQ57 ) was cotransformed with the NheI - linearized TPQ97 . The successful recombination was veriﬁ ed by observa - tion of ﬂ uorescence in microscope and sequencing of the plasmids . Microscopy Microscopy was performed on live cells , resuspended in water . Images were taken with a microscope ( model BX61 ; Olympus ) , a camera Table I .

For Laurdan microscopy , cells were treated with 5 mM sodium azide and 4 % paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 24 ° C ; 250 μ M Laurdan ( Molecu - lar Probes ) was added for a further 5 min at 24 ° C and cells were washed twice and imaged in water . Laurdan ﬂ uorescence was excited at 800 nm with a Verdi / Mira 900 multi - photon laser system and intensity images were recorded simultaneously in the range of 400 – 445 nm and 445 – 530 nm for the two channels ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) , respectively . The general - ized polarization GP , deﬁ ned as (cid:2) (cid:3) (cid:4) ( 400 - 460 ) ( 470 - 530 ) ( 400 - 460 ) ( 470 - 530 ) I I GP I I was calculated for each pixel using the two Laurdan intensity images . GP images were pseudocolored in Adobe Photoshop . The GP values were determined at the mating tip or opposite the tip in a region measuring (cid:4) 1 . 2 × 0 . 2 μ m , and each data point ( or symbol ) in the scatter plots repre - sents derivatives from one individual cell . GP values were corrected using the G - factor obtained for Laurdan in DMSO for each experiment . Means and standard deviation of multiple comparisons were compared with one - way ANOVA with Tukey’s post - testing assuming Gaussian distributions ( PRISM ) ( Gaus et al . , 2003 ) .
