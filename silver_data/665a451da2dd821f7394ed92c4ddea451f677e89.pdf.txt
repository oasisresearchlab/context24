LRRs provide a structural framework for protein – protein interactions ( Kobe and Kajava , 2001 ) . Several LRR - containing proteins , such as TLRs , NODs , and GP1b  , are important in innate immunity ( Tang et al . , 2004 ; Inohara et al . , 2005 ; Lee and Kim , 2007 ) . Little is known about the role of LRR - containing proteins in adaptive immu - nity , with the exception of CIITA ( MHC class II transactivator ) , the deficiency of which results in absent expression of MHC class II mole - cules and severe immunodeficiency ( Cressman et al . , 1999 ) . LRRC8A ( LRR containing 8A ) is a 94 - kD LRR - containing protein highly conserved be - tween human and mouse ( Sawada et al . , 2003 ) . LRRC8A spans the cell membrane four times and its extracellular C terminus contains 17 LRRs ( Sawada et al . , 2003 ; Smits and Kajava , 2004 ) . A 17 - yr - old female patient with congenital facial abnormalities , absent B cells , and agammaglob - ulinemia , but normal numbers of T cells , had a balanced t ( 9 ; 20 ) ( q33 . 2 ; q12 ) translocation , resulting in the deletion of the C - terminal two - and - a - half LRRs of LRRC8A ( 91 aa ) and the addition of 35 aa derived from an intronic sequence ( Sawada et al . , 2003 ) . The truncated LRRC8A product was co - expressed with the intact product of the normal LRRC8A allele at comparable levels ( Sawada et al . , 2003 ) .

We generated Lrrc8a  /  mice to investigate the role of LRRC8A in lymphocyte develop - ment and function . Lrrc8a  /  mice had increased prenatal and postnatal mortality , growth retardation , and multiple tissue abnormalities . Lrrc8a  /  mice displayed a modest block in B cell development but intact intrinsic B cell function . In contrast , both Lrrc8a  /  mice and Lrrc8a  /  → Rag2  /  bone marrow chimeras exhibited a severe cell - intrinsic block in early thymic development , with decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of thymocytes , and impaired peripheral T cell function . Thymic epithelial cells expressed an LRRC8A ligand that was critical for double - negative to double - positive thymocyte differentiation and survival in vitro . LRRC8A constitutively associated with the GRB2 – GAB2 complex and lymphocyte - specific protein tyrosine kinase ( LCK ) in thymocytes . LRRC8A ligation activated AKT via the LCK – ZAP – 70 – GAB2 – PI3K pathway , and AKT phosphorylation was markedly reduced in the thymus of Lrrc8a  /  mice . These findings reveal an essential role for LRRC8A in T cell development , survival , and function . © 2014 Kumar et al .

Our work demonstrates an essential role for LRRC8A in T cell development and function . RESULTS Lrrc8a is widely expressed and LRRC8A is highly expressed on thymocytes compared with other immune cells Lrrc8a mRNA was detected in all 13 tissues tested ( Fig . 1 A ) . We examined cellular expression of LRRC8A using a rabbit polyclonal antibody to the C - terminal 18 - aa - long peptide of LRRC8A , and a mAb , 4D10 , directed against the region be - tween the second and third putative transmembrane domains ( aa 147 – 262 ) of LRRC8A . FACS analysis using these two anti - bodies readily detected LRRC8A on the surface of 293T cells transfected with a vector encoding LRRC8a , but not empty vector ( Fig . S1 A ) , indicating that LRRC8A can be ex - pressed on the cell surface , and that both the N and C termini syngeneic CD34 + BM progenitors transduced with a retroviral vector overexpressing the mutant LRRC8A resulted in a severe block in B cell development at the pro – B cell to pre – B cell tran - sition and reduced numbers of T cells ( Sawada et al . , 2003 ) . The phenotype was attributed to the dominant negative effect of the co - expressed mutant LRRC8A allele ( Conley , 2003 ; Sawada et al . , 2003 ) . No developmental or functional analysis of the T cells was conducted in these mice , and the expression level of the mutant protein in hematopoietic cells was not doc - umented ( Sawada et al . , 2003 ) . To understand the role of LRRC8A in the adaptive im - mune system , we generated Lrrc8a  /  mice that expressed no LRRC8A protein . Unlike the patient , Lrrc8a  /  mice have pe - ripheral B cells and normal immunoglobulin levels but display a severe cell - intrinsic block in thymic development and im - paired peripheral T cell function . We demonstrate that thymic epithelial cell ( TECs ) express ligands for LRRC8A and that LRRC8A ligation activates AKT via the lymphocyte - specific Figure 1 .

Similar results were obtained for all cell lineages using 4D10 mAb ( unpublished data ) . Generation and characterization of Lrrc8a  /  mice The strategy for generating Lrrc8a  /  mice is depicted in Fig . S1 ( C – F ) . LRRC8A was not detectable by immunoblotting thymocyte lysates from Lrrc8a  /  mice ( Fig . S1 G ) or by FACS analysis of splenic T and B cells from these mice ( Fig . 1 E ) . Lrrc8a  /  mice were bred for 10 generations on the C57BL / 6 background . Similar findings were obtained in Lrrc8a  /  mice generated from two independently targeted ES clones . The frequency of live Lrrc8a  /  pups obtained from mating Lrrc8a + /  mice was 5 . 5 % ( Fig . 1 F ) . The frequency of Lrrc8a  /  of the molecule are extracellular , rather than intracellular as has been suggested recently ( Abascal and Zardoya , 2012 ) . This conclu - sion was further supported by the observation that 293T cells transfected with a C - terminally FLAG - tagged LRRC8A dem - onstrated surface staining with anti - FLAG mAb ( Fig . S1 B ) . FACS analysis using C18 antibody revealed that LRRC8A was expressed on the surface of mouse splenic CD3 + T cells , B220 + B cells , DX5 + NK cells , CD14 + macrophages , and CD11c + dendritic cells ( Fig . 1 B and not depicted ) . FACS analysis of permeabilized splenic T and B cells revealed that a substantial amount of LRRC8A was intracellular ( Fig . 1 B ) . Thymocytes and B cells in BM expressed surface LRRC8A at all stages of development , except for minimal , if any , expression on pro – B cells ( Fig . 1 , C and D ) . Thymocytes at all stages had the Figure 2 . B cell development and function in Lrrc8a  /  mice .

Splenic B cell numbers were similarly decreased in Lrrc8a  /  → Rag2  /  chimeras compared with WT → Rag2  /  chimeras ( 11 . 2 ± 1 . 8 × 10 6 versus 47 . 9 ± 3 . 6 × 10 6 cells , n = 3 , P < 0 . 01 ) , indicating that the peripheral B cell lymphopenia in Lrrc8a  /  mice is cell intrinsic . FACS analysis of splenic B cell subsets ( Carsetti et al . , 2004 ) revealed comparable percentages of follicular B cells , but mod - estly decreased percentages of transitional B cells and marginal zone B cells in Lrrc8a  /  mice compared with WT littermates ( Fig . 2 E ) . The numbers and subset distribution of peritoneal B220 + B cells were normal in Lrrc8a  /  mice ( Fig . 2 F ) . Splenic B cells from Lrrc8a  /  mice proliferated normally to anti - IgM , anti - CD40 , and LPS ( Fig . 2 G ) . Except for a higher level of IgG2a , Lrrc8a  /  mice had normal levels of serum IgM , IgA , and IgG isotypes ( Fig . 2 H ) and mounted a normal anti - body response to the type I T independent ( TI ) antigen TNP - LPS and the type II TI antigen TNP - Ficoll ( Fig . 2 I ) . These results suggest that LRRC8A plays a minor role in B cell de - velopment and is important for peripheral B cell homeostasis but not B cell function . LRRC8 deficiency results in decreased thymic cellularity and impaired thymocyte viability The thymus was markedly smaller in Lrrc8a  /  mice compared with WT littermates ( Fig . 3 A ) and had an  10 - fold reduction embryos at E14 . 5 was  7 . 9 % ( n = 38 ) , indicating increased early mortality in utero . Lrrc8a  /  mice had increased postna - tal lethality ; very few survived beyond 4 wk and none beyond 16 wk ( Fig . 1 G ) . Lrrc8a  /  mice appeared normal at birth , but by the end of the first week of life , they showed persistent growth retardation ( Fig . 1 , H and I ) although they fed normally . Lrrc8a  /  exhibited curly hair , hind limb weakness , progressive hydronephrosis , and sterility . Histological examination revealed epidermal hyperkeratosis , thin skeletal muscle bundles , vacuo - lated renal tubular cells , and absence of ovarian corpora lutea ( Fig . 1 J ) . Lrrc8a + /  mice were comparable in appearance , size , and weight to WT littermates ( Fig . 1 , H and I ) and had normal tissue histology ( not depicted ) . LRRC8A deficiency modestly impairs B cell development but not function BM from Lrrc8a  /  mice had normal cellularity , modestly increased percentage of CD43 + B220 low IgM  pro – B cells , and modestly decreased percentages of CD43  B220 low IgM  pre – B cells , CD43  B220 low IgM + immature B cells , and B220 hi IgM hi recirculating B cells ( Fig . 2 , A and B ) . Lrrc8a  /  mice had small spleens with well - preserved architecture ( Fig . 2 C ) . The number of B220 + cells in the spleen was approximately fourfold lower in Lrrc8a  /  mice compared with WT controls ( Fig . 2 D ) . The percentage of splenic B220 + AnnexinV + cells was comparable in Lrrc8a  /  mice and WT controls ( unpub - lished data ) . To exclude the potential contribution of extrinsic Figure 3 .

Data are represen - tative of eight experiments with one mouse per group ( A and B ) , and three independent experiments with one mouse per group ( C – I ) .

The numbers of CD44 + CD25  DN1 cells were decreased , but not significantly , in thymi from Lrrc8a  /  → Rag2  /  chimeras . Irradiation can drive transiently the development of RAG2 - deficient thymo - cytes in a restricted manner generating DP cells that express no surface CD3 , but no SP cells , in the absence of donor - derived hematopoietic cells ( Zúñiga - Pflücker et al . , 1994 ) . The DP and SP cells in the thymi of both chimeras were all CD3 + ( un - published data ) . Furthermore , irradiated Rag2  /  mice did not harbor DP or CD3 + thymocytes when examined at 8 wk ( unpublished data ) . These results indicate that the defect in thymocyte development in Lrrc8a  /  mice is cell intrinsic . The defect in the development of Lrrc8a  /  thymocytes could be due to increased cell death and / or decreased cell pro - liferation . The percentage of annexin V + cells was significantly increased in Lrrc8a  /  → Rag2  /  chimeras ( Fig . 4 D ) , consis - tent with the increased number of apoptotic nuclei noted by TUNEL staining . In addition , BrdU incorporation in vivo was significantly decreased in thymocytes from Lrrc8a  /  → Rag2  /  chimeras compared with controls ( Fig . 4 E ) . Thymocyte prolif - eration to anti - CD3 + IL - 2 was significantly decreased Lrrc8a  /  → Rag2  /  chimeras compared with control chimeras , but prolif - eration to PMA + ionomycin was comparable in the two groups ( Fig . 4 F ) . Thus , LRRC8A expression by thymocytes is essen - tial for their survival and proliferation . Lrrc8a  /  mice exhibited a more exaggerated block in thymocyte development than Lrrc8a  /  → Rag2  /  chimeras and a substantial decrease in the percentage of DP cells , re - flected by a drastic decrease in their number compared with WT controls ( Fig . 5 , A and B ) . The decreased percentage of DP thymocytes and the resulting greater reduction in thymocyte numbers in Lrrc8a  /  mice compared with Lrrc8a  /  → Rag2  /  in cellularity ( Fig . 3 B ) . Examination of H & E - stained thymus sections demonstrated effacement of the corticomedullary junction and numerous pyknotic and karyorrhectic nuclei in Lrrc8a  /  mice ( Fig . 3 C ) . TdT - mediated dUTP nick end la - beling ( TUNEL ) demonstrated significantly increased num - bers of apoptotic cells in Lrrc8a  /  thymi ( Fig . 3 D ) . This was confirmed by the presence of increased numbers of CD3 + cells that co - stained for activated caspase 3 ( Fig . 3 E ) . These results suggest that LRRC8A is important for thymocyte survival . To exclude the effect of environmental factors on T cell development in Lrrc8a  /  mice , we examined thymi from Rag2  /  chimeras reconstituted with either Lrrc8a  /  or WT BM cells . Thymi of Lrrc8a  /  → Rag2  /  chimeras were smaller and contained approximately fourfold fewer cells compared with thymi from WT → Rag2  /  control chimeras ( Fig . 3 , F and G ) . Histological analysis revealed impaired corticomedullary differ - entiation with increased numbers of karyorrhectic and apoptotic nuclei in thymi from Lrrc8a  /  → Rag2  /  chimeras compared with thymi from control chimeras ( Fig . 3 , H and I ) . Lrrc8a  /  mice have a cell - autonomous early block in thymocyte development The distribution of double negative ( DN ) , double positive ( DP ) , and single positive ( SP ) subsets was comparable between Lrrc8a  /  → Rag2  /  and control chimeras ( Fig . 4 A ) . How - ever , as expected from the reduced thymic cellularity , the numbers of CD4  CD8  DN , CD4 + CD8 + DP , and CD4 + and CD8 + SP thymocytes were reduced by approximately threefold in Lrrc8a  /  → Rag2  /  chimeras compared with con - trols ( Fig . 4 B ) . Analysis of DN subsets revealed a significant re - duction in the numbers of CD44 + CD25 + DN2 , CD44  CD25 + DN3 , and CD44  CD25  DN4 cells in Lrrc8a  /  → Rag2  /  Figure 4 .

LRRC8A deficiency impairs peripheral T cell expansion and function Spleens of Lrrc8a  /  → Rag2  /  chimeras were smaller ( Fig . 6 A ) and had an approximately fourfold decrease in the number of CD3 + T cells compared with WT → Rag2  /  control chime - ras ( Fig . 6 B ) . The splenic CD4 / CD8 ratio was comparable in Lrrc8a  /  → Rag2  /  and control chimeras ( Fig . 6 C ) . Lrrc8a  /  → Rag2  /  chimeras had a significant decrease in the percentage of splenic CD4 + CD62L lo CD44 hi T effector memory cells com - pared with control chimeras , and a compensatory increase in the percentage of CD4 + CD62L hi CD44 lo naive T cells ( Fig . 6 D ) . The proliferation of splenic T cells to immobilized anti - CD3 was significantly impaired in Lrrc8a  /  → Rag2  /  chimeras compared with controls and was not increased by the addi - tion of anti - CD28 mAb ( Fig . 6 E ) . T cells from Lrrc8a  /  → Rag2  /  chimeras proliferated normally in response to stimu - lation with PMA and ionomycin , indicating that they do not have a general intrinsic proliferative defect . These results in - dicate that LRRC8A is important for peripheral T cell expan - sion and function . Like Lrrc8a  /  → Rag2  /  chimeras , Lrrc8a  /  mice had a significant reduction in the number of splenic T cells com - pared with WT controls , with a normal CD4 / CD8 ratio ( Fig . 6 , F and G ) . The percentage of splenic CD3 + Annexin V + cells was comparable in Lrrc8a  /  and WT mice ( unpublished data ) . chimeras suggest that extrinsic factors exacerbate the cell - intrinsic thymic phenotype in Lrrc8a  /  mice . DP thymocytes are exquisitely sensitive to damage by cytokines and hormones ( Screpanti et al . , 1989 ; Cohen , 1992 ; Ivanov and Nikoli ć - Zugi ć , 1998 ; Gruver and Sempowski , 2008 ) . Serum chemistry profile and levels of TNF and cortisol levels were normal in Lrrc8a  /  mice ( unpublished data ) . As in the Lrrc8a  /  → Rag2  /  chi - meras , the numbers of DN2 - DN4 , but not DN1 , cells were significantly lower in Lrrc8a  /  mice than in WT controls ( Fig . 5 C ) . The distribution of DN1a - e subsets , including the DN1a and DN1b early thymic progenitors ( ETPs ; Porritt et al . , 2004 ) , and the percentage of Lin  Sca1 + c - kit + ( LSK ) cells in the BM which contain thymic multipotent progenitors ( Ikuta and Weissman , 1992 ; Schwarz and Bhandoola , 2004 ) were com - parable in Lrrc8a  /  and WT mice ( Fig . 5 , D and E ) . As in Lrrc8a  /  → Rag2  /  chimeras , the percentage of annexin V + apoptotic thymocytes was increased and the BrdU incorpora - tion in thymocytes was decreased significantly in Lrrc8a  /  mice compared with WT controls ( Fig . 5 , F and G ) . The percentage of TCR -  /  cells and the mean fluorescence intensity of the TCR -  chain on phenotypically mature thymocytes were comparable in Lrrc8a  /  mice and WT controls ( Fig . 5 , H and I ) . Unexpectedly , Lrrc8a  /  thymi had a significant increase in FOXP3 + regulatory T ( T reg ) cells by immunohistochemistry staining and flow cytometry ( Fig . 5 , J and K ) . Figure 5 .

JEM Vol . 211 , No . 5 Article 935 LRRC8A is dispensable for the development and function of thymic epithelium TECs play a critical role in thymic development ( Rodewald , 2008 ) . Because Lrrc8a is ubiquitously expressed , we examined TECs from Lrrc8a  /  mice . FACS analysis revealed that the percentages of CD45  classII + BP1 + cortical TECs ( cTECs ) and CD45  classII + BP1  medullary TECs ( mTECs ) among CD45  nonlymphoid cells were comparable in Lrrc8a  /  mice and WT littermates ( Fig . 7 A ) . Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the presence of both CK8 + CK5  cTECs and CK8  CK5 + mTECs in Lrrc8a  /  thymi ( Fig . 7 B ) ; how - ever , their architectural distribution was abnormal with a very thin cortical layer and a disorganized medulla . In spite of the However , splenic T cells from Lrrc8a  /  mice , like those from Lrrc8a  /  → Rag2  /  chimeras , had significantly impaired pro - liferation to immobilized anti - CD3 , which was not increased by the addition of anti - CD28 mAb or IL - 2 ( Fig . 6 H ) . Analy - sis of TCR - V  CDR3 diversity at 6 wk of age showed partial restriction of the T cell repertoire in Lrrc8a  /  mice com - pared with age - matched WT littermates , as indicated by skewed distribution for some (  25 % ) , but not all , of the TCR - V  families analyzed ( Fig . 6 I ) . The limited restric - tion of the TCR repertoire in Lrrc8a  /  mice is compatible with an abnormal TCR repertoire selection in the thymus and / or with abnormal clonal expansion / maintenance in the periphery .

Specifically , the grafts demonstrated corticomedullary differ - entiation with generation of SP T cell residents in the medulla ( Fig . 7 D ) . Thus , LRRC8A is dispensable for the development of TECs and for their ability to support T cell development . However , a role for LRRC8A in dendritic cell – thymocyte interactions cannot be ruled out . A ligand for LRRC8A is expressed by TECs and is important for the maturation of DN into DP thymocytes We tested the hypothesis that a ligand for LRRC8A is ex - pressed by TECs and is important for thymocyte maturation . Because of the kidney tubule abnormalities in Lrrc8a  /  mice , we initially examined whether the human embryonic kidney epithelial cell line 293T expresses an LRRC8A ligand . FACS analysis revealed increased binding of glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) – LRRC8A 343 - 810 fusion protein ( GST - LRRC8A ) to 293T cells , compared with GST ( Fig . 8 A ) . This binding was specific because it was displaced by MBP - LRRC8A , but not by MBP ( Fig . 8 A ) . Conversely , MBP - LRRC8A bound to 293T cells and was displaced by GST - LRRC8A but not GST ( unpublished data ) . GST - LRRC8A did not bind to spleno - cytes ( Fig . 8 B ) , further indicating the specificity of its binding to 293T cells . GST - LRRC8A bound to WT CD45  TECs , but not CD45 + thymocytes , including DN , DP , and SP cells ( Fig . 8 , C and D ) . Both CD45  classII + BP1 + cTECs and CD45  classII + BP1  mTECs bound GST - LRRC8A ( Fig . 8 C ) . These results indicate that an LRRC8A ligand is expressed on non - hematopoietic cells , including TECs . The BM - derived stromal cell line OP9 stably transfected with the Notch ligand Delta - like 1 ( OP9 - DL1 ) supports the differentiation and expansion of DN thymocytes into DP cells in the presence of IL - 7 and Flt - 3 ligand ( Flt3L ; Schmitt and Zúñiga - Pflücker , 2002 ) . GST - LRRC8A specifically bound to OP9 - DL1 ( Fig . 8 E ) . Addition of GST - LRRC8A , but not GST alone , significantly inhibited the maturation of WT DN thymocytes into DP thymocytes in co - cultures with OP9 - DL1 cells in the presence of IL - 7 and Flt - 3L ( Fig . 8 , F and G ) and resulted in a higher percentage of annexin V + apoptotic DN and DP cells ( Fig . 8 H ) . Inhibition of the DN to DP maturation by GST - LRRC8a was dose dependent ( Fig . 8 I ) . These results suggest that interaction of LRRC8A in thymocytes with its li - gand on OP9 - DL1 cells is important for the in vitro matura - tion and survival of DN thymocytes into DP thymocytes . LRRC8A associates with GRB2 , GAB2 , and LCK and activates AKT in thymocytes via the LCK – ZAP - 70 – GAB2 – PI3K pathway The kinase AKT has been implicated in the survival and pro - liferation of thymocytes ( Chen et al . , 2001 ; Juntilla et al . , 2007 ) . Given the increased cell death of LRRC8 - deficient thymocytes , we examined whether LRRC8A activates AKT . Cross - linking of LRRC8A with anti - LRRC8A mAb resulted in AKT phos - phorylation in WT thymocytes ( Fig . 9 A ) , including DN thy - mocytes ( Fig . 9 B ) . LRRC8A cross - linking failed to cause AKT phosphorylation in Lrrc8a  /  thymocytes ( Fig . 9 C ) , but TCR / CD3 cross - linking caused normal AKT phosphorylation architectural abnormalities , mTECs showed signs of maturation with expression of autoimmune regulator ( AIRE ) , Claudin - 4 , and the ligand for ulex europeus agglutinin 1 ( UEA - 1 ; Fig . 7 C ) . Implantation of fetal thymic tissue from WT and Lrrc8a  /  mice into the kidney subcapsular region of 5 - wk - old con - genic mice supported comparable thymocyte development . Figure 7 .

JEM Vol . 211 , No . 5 Article 937 structurally different SRC kinase inhibitors PP2 and SU6656 , and SYK / ZAP - 70 inhibitors Piceatannol and R406 , but not the MEK1 / 2 inhibitor GSK1120212 , blocked LRRC8A - driven AKT phosphorylation in thymocytes ( Fig . 9 J and not depicted ) . Furthermore , LRRC8A - driven AKT phosphory - lation was diminished in Zap70  /  thymocytes ( Fig . 9 K ) . These results indicate that LRRC8A constitutively associates with the GRB2 – GAB2 complex and LCK , and activates AKT via the LCK – ZAP - 70 – GAB2 – PI3K pathway . We examined whether the lack of LRRC8A impairs AKT phosphorylation in thymocytes . Immunostaining sec - tions of thymi fixed immediately after sacrifice revealed the presence of pAKT throughout the thymus in WT mice , with the subcapsular area giving the highest signal , but less intense pAKT staining in the thymus in Lrrc8a  /  mice ( Fig . 10 A ) . pAKT staining was specific because it was abolished by prein - cubation with the specific phosphopeptide used for immuni - zation ( Fig . 10 B ) . Compared with WT thymi , Lrrc8a  /  thymi had a reduced percentage of pAKT - positive thymocytes , and a lower pAKT / AKT staining intensity ratio with a normal in these cells . LRRC8A - driven AKT phosphorylation in WT thymocytes was completely inhibited by LY294002 ( Fig . 9 A ) , indicating that it was dependent on PI3 kinase ( PI3K ) . Both intracellular loops of LRRC8A lack the YXXM binding motif for binding PI3K . Receptors whose intracellu - lar domain lacks this motif activate AKT by associating with the GRB2 – GAB2 complex ( Gu and Neel , 2003 ; Caron et al . , 2009 ) . GAB2 associates with the SRC kinases and is tyrosine phosphorylated by these kinases and ZAP - 70 ( Gu and Neel , 2003 ; Palacios and Weiss , 2007 ) on Y 452 . This residue is part of the YXXM motif in GAB2 that recruits the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K by interacting with its SH2 domain ( Nishida et al . , 1999 ; Zhao et al . , 1999 ; Crouin et al . , 2001 ) . The first intracellular loop of LRRC8A contains a proline - rich region that could potentially interact with the SH3 domain of the adaptor GRB2 and SRC kinases . LRRC8A was found to be constitutively associated in thymocytes with GRB2 , GAB2 , and LCK ( Fig . 9 , D – F ) . Furthermore , LRRC8A ligation on thymocytes caused tyrosine phosphorylation of GAB2 at resi - due Y 452 , LCK , and its substrate ZAP - 70 ( Fig . 9 , G – I ) . The Figure 8 .

Our studies demonstrate that LRRC8A activates AKT via the LCK – ZAP - 70 – GAB2 – PI3K pathway . LRRC8A consti - tutively associates with the GRB2 – GAB2 complex and LCK . These associations may be direct , via interactions between the proline - rich region in the first intracellular domain of LRRC8A and the SH3 domain of GRB2 and LCK , and / or indirectly via the interaction of GAB2 with GRB2 and LCK ( Gu and Neel , 2003 ) . LRRC8A ligation caused phosphoryla - tion of LCK and its substrate ZAP - 70 , and of their target GAB2 at residue Y 452 , which , when phosphorylated , recruits PI3K to GAB2 . The recruited PI3K undergoes phosphorylation by LCK and triggers AKT phosphorylation . LRRC8A - mediated activation of AKT was blocked by SRC , SYK / ZAP - 70 , and PI3K inhibitors . Thymocytes express both LCK and FYN . They also express both SYK and ZAP - 70 , with SYK expres - sion highest in DN thymocytes and ZAP - 70 expression high - est in SP thymocytes ( Chu et al . , 1998 ; Palacios and Weiss , 2007 ) . LRRC8A could use different SYK and SRC family ki - nase members to activate AKT . AKT phosphorylation was markedly reduced in thymo - cytes from Lrrc8a  /  mice compared with thymocytes from WT controls . Given the established role of AKT in thymo - cyte survival , proliferation , and metabolism ( Chen et al . , 2001 ; percentage of AKT - positive thymocytes ( Fig . 10 , C and D ) . The decreased AKT phosphorylation in Lrrc8a  /  thymi is spe - cific because Lrrc8a  /  and WT thymi had comparable stain - ing for pSTAT3 and STAT3 ( Fig . 10 , E and F ) . The percentage of thymocytes that stained with pAKT , but not of those that stained with AKT , was also markedly reduced in thymi from Lrrc8a  /  → Rag2  /  chimeras compared with those from con - trol chimeras ( Fig . 10 G ) . DISCUSSION The present study demonstrates that LRRC8A plays a critical cell - autonomous role in T lymphocyte development and func - tion . The thymus of Lrrc8a  /  → Rag2  /  chimeras , like that of Lrrc8a  /  mice , had decreased cellularity , disorganized architec - ture , increased apoptosis , and decreased proliferation , indicating that these defects are T cell intrinsic . The decreased prolifer - ation of thymocytes from Lrrc8a  /  → Rag2  /  chimeras to anti – CD3 + IL - 2 , but not to the TCR - independent stimuli PMA + ionomycin , suggests that LRRC8A signaling contributes to TCR - driven thymocyte proliferation . The numbers of thymo - cytes at the DN2 stage and beyond were significantly reduced in Lrrc8a  /  → Rag2  /  chimeras , as in Lrrc8a  /  mice , indicat - ing that the early block in thymocyte development is cell auton - omous . Despite their defective T cell development and function , Lrrc8a  /  → Rag2  /  chimeras had no increase in mortality , Figure 9 .

( K ) LRRC8A - and TCR / CD3 - driven AKT phosphorylation in thymo - cytes from WT or Zap70  /  mice after LRRC8A or TCR / CD3 ligation . Data are representative of three independent experiments with cells derived from one mouse per experiment ( A , B , and D – J ) , and two independent experiments with cells derived from one mouse per group ( C and K ) . The numbers below the blots in A , C , and J represent the mean ratio of pAKT / AKT in two ( C ) and three ( A and J ) experiments . JEM Vol . 211 , No . 5 Article 939 A ligand for LRRC8A was detected on TECs and on the stromal cell line OP9 . A fusion protein containing GST and the extracellular domain of LRRC8A inhibited OP9 - DL1 cell – dependent maturation of DN cells into DP cells in vitro . This finding , together with the decreased pAKT con - tent of the thymus in Lrrc8a  /  mice , suggests that the puta - tive LRRC8A ligand expressed by TECs delivers a critical survival signal via AKT to thymocytes . In addition to 293T cells , GST - LRRC8A bound to keratinocytes and fibroblasts ( unpublished data ) , suggesting that disruption of LRRC8A interaction with a ligand expressed by epithelial and mesen - chymal cells may contribute to the tissue pathology in Lrrc8a  /  mice . Identification of this ligand is currently the subject of investigation . The reduced number of T cells and decreased percentage of CD4 + T effector memory cells in the spleen of Lrrc8a  /  → Rag2  /  chimeras suggest that cell - intrinsic expression of LRRC8A in T cells is important for their homeostatic expan - sion in the periphery . The decreased proliferation of splenic T cells from these chimeras in response to TCR / CD3 liga - tion , but intact response to PMA + ionomycin , suggest that LRRC8A delivers a co - stimulatory signal to antigen - activated T cells . Indeed , ligation of LRRC8A causes AKT activation in normal splenic T cells ( unpublished data ) , as it does in thy - mocytes . Lack of LRRC8A - driven AKT activation and / or maturation in an abnormal thymic environment may contrib - ute to the decreased homeostatic proliferation and impaired function of LRRC8A - deficient peripheral T cells . Selective deletion of Lrrc8a in mature T cells is needed to distinguish between these two possibilities . Juntilla et al . , 2007 ) , the significant reduction in tonic AKT phosphorylation may play an important role in the defective thymic maturation of Lrrc8a  /  mice . Decreased AKT activa - tion could also explain the relative increase in CD4 + FOXP3 + cells in thymus of these mice because AKT inhibits the gen - eration of these cells ( Haxhinasto et al . , 2008 ; Merkenschlager and von Boehmer , 2010 ) . The block in thymocyte maturation occurs earlier in Lrrc8a  /  mice than in Akt1  /  / Akt2  /  mice , in which the DN3 : DN4 transition is blocked ( Juntilla et al . , 2007 ) . This could be explained by the fact that thymo - cytes from Akt1  /  / Akt2  /  still express Akt3 ( Juntilla et al . , 2007 ) and that LRRC8A ligation may deliver signals in addi - tion to AKT that are important for thymocyte development and survival . In addition to Akt , several genes have been implicated in early thymic development . They include Notch 1 and its down - stream targets Hes1 , Deltex , Nrap , and pTCR  ( Deftos et al . , 1998 , 2000 ; Krebs et al . , 2001 ; Lamar et al . , 2001 ) , as well as Bcl - 2 ( Deftos et al . , 1998 ) and Bcl11b ( Wakabayashi et al . , 2003 ; Li et al . , 2010 ) . qPCR analysis revealed that the expression of these genes was either unaffected , or in a few cases increased , in DN1 - DN4 thymocytes from Lrrc8a  /  mice compared with WT littermates ( unpublished data ) . IL - 7R signaling is impor - tant for the survival of early thymocytes ( Peschon et al . , 1994 ; Akashi et al . , 1997 ; Kim et al . , 1998 ) . Surface expression of IL - 7R  by thymocyte subpopulations ( DN1 - 4 , DP , and SP ) was comparable between Lrrc8a  /  mice and controls ( unpub - lished data ) . These results rule out a role for abnormalities in the above pathways in the thymic developmental block caused by LRRC8A deficiency . Figure 10 .

Annexin - V staining kit from BioVision was used for the detection of apoptotic cells . Anti - FLAG mAb ( clone M2 ) was purchased from Sigma - Aldrich . Intracellular staining was done as per the instructions provided with Cytoperm / Cytofix cell per - meabilization and staining kit ( BD ) . BrdU incorporation assays . Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 mg BrdU in 100 µl 1× PBS and , 3 h later , tissues were harvested and BrdU incor - poration was analyzed by using a BrdU Flow kit ( BD ) . Thymus transplantation and immunofluorescence . Individual thymus lobes from E14 . 5 – 18 . 5 WT and Lrrc8a  /  embryos were transplanted under the kidney capsule of anesthetized recipient mice . For staining cryosections , thymi were harvested , fixed in phosphate - buffered l - lysine with 1 % parafor - maldehyde / periodate ( PLP ) , dehydrated in 30 % sucrose in PBS , snap - frozen Lrrc8a  /  mice had a modest block in B cell development and normal B cell function . However , Lrrc8a  /  mice and Lrrc8a  /  → Rag2  /  chimeras had a fourfold decrease in splenic B cells , suggesting that LRRC8A is important for peripheral B cell homeostasis . Ligation of LRRC8A caused AKT phos - phorylation in B cells ( unpublished data ) , and AKT is impor - tant for maintaining normal numbers of peripheral B cells ( Juntilla et al . , 2007 ) . Thus , loss of LRRC8A - mediated AKT activation in B cells may have contributed to the peripheral B cell lymphopenia in Lrrc8a  /  mice . In contrast to the Lrrc8a  /  mouse , the patient with the heterozygous LRRC8A mutation had no circulating B cells and agammaglobulinemia but normal numbers of circulating T cells ( Sawada et al . , 2003 ) . The function of these T cells was not tested , but no opportunistic infections were reported in the patient despite an age of 17 yr . The difference in the two phe - notypes most likely reflects the difference between the presence of a truncated mutant protein in the patient , which is thought to have acted as dominant negative ( Conley , 2003 ; Sawada et al . , 2003 ) , and the complete absence of the protein in the knock - out mouse . Given the 99 % aa sequence homology between human and mouse LRRC8A , loss of LRRC8A expression in humans would likely present as severe combined immunodefi - ciency associated with multiple organ abnormalities . MATERIALS AND METHODS Generation of Lrrc8a  /  mice . We designed a gene - targeting construct for replacing the exon 3 , which encodes the first 719 aa of LRRC8A . DNA fragments 4 . 809 and 3 . 375 kb in length were PCR amplified from a BAC clone DNA encoding the entire Lrrc8a gene ( RP23 - 315H12 ) and cloned 5  and 3  in the pLNTK gene targeting vector . The linearized targeting con - struct was then electroporated into CJ7 ES cells , which were then selected in medium containing 0 . 4 mg / ml G418 and 10 mg / ml Gancyclovir . Of the three ES clones identified with targeted deletion of one of the two alleles of Lrrc8a , two were injected into C57BL / 6 blastocysts for the generation of chimeric mice . ES cell clones and mice were genotyped by Southern blot and PCR . The LoxP - flanked neo selection cassette was then removed by breeding mice with EII Cre transgenic mice . All mice were kept in a patho - gen - free environment . All procedures were performed in accordance with the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Boston Children’s Hospital . All experiments used 4 – 6 - wk - old Lrrc8a  /  mice and WT littermates . Due to the limited availability of Lrrc8a  /  mice and high pre - and postnatal mortal - ity , many experiments were performed with one Lrrc8a  /  and one WT lit - termate and were repeated at least three times . Anti - LRRC8A antibodies and immunoblotting . A polyclonal antibody ( C18 ) was raised in rabbits against a C - terminal 18 - aa - long peptide ( NH 2 - FSTLPPEVKERLWRADKE - COOH ) sequence ( aa 791 – 808 ) of LRRC8A and purified from using LRRC8A peptide Sepharose column chromatography . An LRRC8A - specific mouse mAb ( 4D10 ) was raised against the first extra - cellular loop ( aa 147 – 262 ) of LRRC8A using standard protocols and puri - fied from ascites by protein G column chromatography . Cell lysates were immunoblotted using C18 or 4D10 Abs , followed by HRP - conjugated goat anti – rabbit antibody or goat anti – mouse antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase – HRP and ECL . Histology , immunohistochemistry , and immunofluorescence . Mouse tissue histopathology was performed at the Rodent Histopathology Core facility at the Harvard Medical School . TUNEL staining of thymic sections was performed as per the instructions of the manufacturer ( BD ) . 2 - µm - thick formalin - fixed paraffin - embedded sections were subjected to hematoxylin and JEM Vol . 211 , No . 5 Article 941 Ly294002 ( PI3K inhibitors ) were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich . GSK1120212 ( MEK1 / 2 inhibitor ) was purchased from BioVision Technology , Inc . LRRC8A and LCK immunoprecipitations were performed as described earlier ( de la Fuente et al . , 2006 ) using anti - LRRC8A antibodies and anti - LCK mouse monoclonal antibody ( clone 3A5 ; Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . ) , respec - tively . Cell activation marker expression , thymocytes , and splenic B and T cell proliferation and cytokine production assays were performed as described previously ( de la Fuente et al . , 2006 ) . Serum immunoglobulins and antibody measurements . Serum im - munoglobulins and antibody levels were determined by previously described methods . Mice were immunized with KLH prepared with Imject Alum ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) , TNP - Ficoll , or TNP - LPS ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) . ELISA assays were performed to estimate specific immunoglobulins levels in the serum samples of the immunized mice as earlier ( de la Fuente et al . , 2006 ) . Quantitative RT - PCR . Total RNA was prepared from the flow cytometri - cally – sorted WT and KO DN1 - 4 thymocytes using the RNAqueous extrac - tion kit ( Ambion ) . RT - PCR was performed using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) . Carboxyfluorescein ( FAM ) - labeled specific Taq - Man primers were purchased from Applied Biosystems . Quantitative PCR reactions were run on an ABI Prism 7300 sequence detection system plat - form ( Applied Biosystems ) . The housekeeping gene  2 - microglobulin was used as a control . The relative gene expression among the different sam - ples was determined using the method described by Pfaffl ( 2001 ) . Quan - tities of all targets in test samples were normalized to the corresponding  2 - microglobulin levels . Statistical analysis . Statistical analysis of the data using the Student’s t test or analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) was performed with Prism software ( Graph - Pad Software Inc . ) . Online supplemental material . Fig .

Proliferation and activation of thymocytes and splenic T and B cells . Thymocytes were prepared as described earlier ( de la Fuente et al . , 2006 ) . Splenic T and B cells were purified by negative selection using kits from Miltenyi Biotec . Thymocytes and purified T cells were cultured in medium alone or in wells coated with 2 µg / ml anti - CD3 monoclonal antibody ( clone KT3 ; Abcam ) with or without 2 µg / ml anti - CD28 ( clone L293 ; BD ) or 40 ng / ml IL - 2 ( PeproTech ) . PMA ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was used at 50 ng / ml , and ionomycin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) was used at 0 . 5 µM . Purified B cells were cultured in medium alone or in the presence of goat F ( ab  ) 2 anti – mouse IgM ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories , Inc . ) , 2 µg / ml anti - CD40 ( R & D Systems ) , or 10 µg / ml LPS ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . 72 h later , the cells were pulsed with 1 µCi [ 3 H ] thymidine and counted . TCR - V  repertoire analysis . TCR - V  repertoire clonality determination on splenic T cells was performed using spectratyping by BioMed Immunotech , Inc . Generation of LRRC8A fusion proteins and analysis of binding of LRRC8A fusion protein to cells . LRRC8A C - terminal polypeptide ( aa 343 – 810 ) was fused downstream of GST and MBP ( maltose binding pro - tein ) in pGEX - 4T1 ( GE Healthcare ) and pMAL - c2G ( New England Biolabs , Inc . ) expression vectors , respectively . Fusion proteins were expressed in rec - ommended bacterial hosts . Expressed GST - LRRC8A and MBP - LRRC8A fusion proteins were purified as per the manufacturer’s instructions . Target cells were incubated with GST / GST - LRRC8A or MBP / MBP - LRRC8A on ice for 30 min . The binding of LRRC8A fusion proteins was detected using flow cytometry by staining cells with the appropriate fluorochrome - labeled anti - tag antibody ( anti - GST antibody [ clone 26H1 ; Cell Signaling Technology ] or anti - MBP antibody [ clone MBP - 17 ; Sigma - Aldrich ] ) . In vitro maturation of DN to DP thymocytes . Purified DN thymocytes were cultured on monolayers of OP9 - DL1 cells ( gift from J . C . Zúñiga - Pflücker , University of Toronto , Toronto , Canada ) in recombinant IL - 7 and Flt3L ( Pepro - Tech ) containing medium in the presence of either GST / GST - LRRC8A or MBP / MBP - LRRC8A for 4 – 6 d as described earlier ( Schmitt and Zúñiga - Pflücker , 2002 ) , after which cells were harvested and analyzed by FACS .
