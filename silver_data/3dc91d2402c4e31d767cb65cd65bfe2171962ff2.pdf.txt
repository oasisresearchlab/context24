Our analysis of the supramolecular polymerization by using mass - balance models suggested that the Archime - dean spiral is formed at high concentrations of the monomer , whereas other aggregation types might form at low concentrations .

For example , Fujita et al . 5 discovered a new poly - hedron , the existence of which was not predictable from their previous studies . Once a graph theory was established for the new family of polyhedrons , it was possible to predict the formation of a larger member in the family , which was later experimentally con ﬁ rmed . One of us 6 identi ﬁ ed pathway complexity in supra - molecular polymerization , the mechanism of which was eluci - dated experimentally and computationally , thereby permitting the synthesis of an otherwise thermodynamically inaccessible helical supramolecular polymer . In such cases , weak interactions and subtle structural constraints accumulate , and kinetic effects often play signi ﬁ cant roles , resulting in unexpected outcomes . It thus appears that principles of molecular self - assembly established for small discrete structures , such as host – guest systems or inter - locked molecules , cannot simply be extended to design much larger structures . Consequently , molecular self - assembly at a higher hierarchical level remains largely unexplored 7 – 13 . Here we report two unusual self - assembled structures formed from a porphyrinato zinc derivative bearing ﬂ uorinated side chains , 6FF ( Fig . 1a ) . Previously , we found that an analogous porphyrin 6HH forms one - molecule - thick two - dimensional ( 2D ) supramolecular nanosheets ( Figs . 1b and 2b ) 14 . In these nanosheets , porphyrin cores of 6HH stack in a short - slipping J - aggregation mode , as characterized by a split Soret band ( Fig . 2a ) , and the 2D growth is driven by van der Waals forces between the hexyl chains ( see the x - and y - axes in Fig . 1b ) . By unveiling this intricate self - assembly mechanism , we succeeded in obtaining supramolecular nanosheets with controlled areas and a distinct aspect ratio . Our original objective in designing 6FF was to synthesize supramolecular nanosheets , similar to those of 6HH , but with different aspect ratios 15 , by changing the nature of the intermolecular interactions along the y - axis from van der Waals forces to a ﬂ uorophilic effect 16 – 21 . To our surprise , however , atomic - force microscopy ( AFM ) studies showed that 6FF formed circular nanosheets with holes at their centers ( Figs . 1c and 2c ) . Interestingly , each of these circular nanosheets consisted of a one - dimensional ( 1D ) supramolecular polymer coiled into an Archi - medean spiral ( a spiral in which the consecutive turns are sepa - rated by a constant distance ) . Our initial analyses of the supramolecular polymerizations with mass - balance models failed to describe the aggregation process over a wide range of con - centrations and implied that 6FF might form different aggregates at low concentrations . Indeed , we discovered that 6FF formed supramolecular concentric toroids under more - dilute conditions . Moreover , a mechanistic insight into the self - assembly process of 6FF permitted a controlled synthesis of the concentric toroids . Results Discovery of an unusual self - assembled structure . When a hot solution of 6FF in an aliphatic solvent was cooled to room tem - perature , a Soret band that was blue - shifted relative to that of the monomeric state was observed , suggesting the formation of an H - aggregate ( i . e . , face - to - face stacking ) ( Fig . 2a ) . Contrary to our expectations ( see above ) , this result together with our previous studies indicated that 6FF self - assembled to form 1D supramole - cular polymers rather than 2D nanosheets 14 , 22 – 27 . When the solution was spin - coated onto a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite ( HOPG ) substrate and examined by AFM , we were surprised to ﬁ nd that the 1D supramolecular polymer coiled to form a series of circular nanosheets ( Fig . 2c , d ) . Similar structures were observed on other substrates , such as mica or silicon wafers , suggesting that the spirals were formed in solution without any in ﬂ uence of the substrate ( Supplementary Fig . 7 ) . As such , the self - assembly pro - cess of 6FF is distinctly different from those of other supramole - cular spirals reported in the literatures , which required the presence of 2D self - assembly ﬁ elds , such as substrate surfaces or an air – water interface 28 – 32 . When we tested other solvents , we found that the spiral structures tended to form in linear alkanes , such as hexane or dodecane ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . No split Soret band was observed for 6FF in any of the solvents examined , suggesting that it is incapable of forming short - slipping J - aggregates such as that of 6HH , despite the structural similarity of these two mono - mers ( Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . The spiral formed by 6FF is tightly coiled with a constant separation distance between consecutive turns , a characteristic of so - called Archimedean spirals which can be described in polar coordinates as follows : r ¼ a þ b θ In Fig . 2e , the center of the circular nanosheet was ﬁ xed at the origin of the polar coordinate and we de ﬁ ned r as the distance between the origin and the spiral trajectory with the highest contrast in the AFM image . A plot of r as a function of θ was ﬁ tted to values of a and b of 23 . 1 and 1 . 08 nm , respectively ( Fig . 2f ) . Other structural features of the Archimedean spiral are summarized in Supplementary Fig . 10 and Supplementary Table 1 . In brief , the thickness ( 4 . 3 nm ) and circularity ( 0 . 96 ) were uniform , whereas the area was polydisperse [ dispersity Đ = 1 . 61 ; A w = 38 , 500 nm 2 ; A n = 24 , 000 nm 2 , where Đ is the ratio of weight - average area ( A w ) to the number - average area ( A n ) ] . Unlike previously reported supramolecular coils and helices 33 , 34 , the curvature ( 1 / r ) of an Archimedean spiral is not a constant , indicating that the higher - order structure of 6FF is not strongly dictated by the structure of the 6FF molecule . It is reasonable to hypothesize that the 1D supramolecular polymer of 6FF becomes tightly coiled so as to minimize the surface area of its ﬂ uorinated segments that is exposed to the aliphatic solvent 16 – 21 . This hypothesis is supported by our observation that the Archimedean spiral formed from 6FH , which contains only one ﬂ uoroalkyl chain ( Fig . 1a ) , was less stable than that formed from 6FF ( discussed later ) . If tight packing of the side chains drives the formation of the spiral , the ﬂ uoroalkyl chains should be oriented in - plane of the circular nanosheets , which in turn suggests that the constant separation distance between consecutive turns in the spiral should match the length between the two ﬂ uorinated side chains in 6FF . However , the separation between the turns ( 2 π b = 6 . 8 nm ) was about double the distance between the side chains ( 3 . 5 nm ; Supplementary Fig . 11 ) . Thus , the surface visualized by AFM is not satisfactorily explained by the proposed molecular packing geometry of 6FF in the Archimedean spiral . To address this discrepancy between the spacing and the side - chain distance , we examined the Archimedean spiral by scanning transmission electron microscopy ( STEM ) and by small - angle X - ray scattering ( SAXS ) . Interestingly , the separation distance between consecutive turns was determined to be 3 . 1 nm by annular dark ﬁ eld ( ADF ) – STEM ( Fig . 2g and Supplementary Fig . 12 ) . In addition , SAXS measurements on a solution sample showed a similar periodicity of 3 . 3 nm ( Supplementary Fig . 13 ) . Much to our surprise , the evidence as a whole suggests that our Archimedean spiral is double - stranded ( Fig . 2h ) ; namely , the spiral is a layered structure in which another Archimedean spiral is present on the bottom of the circular nanosheet . In fact , when we inspected defect and edge domains by AFM , a thin layer was con ﬁ rmed beneath the spiral ( Supplementary Fig . 14 ) . Thus , adjacent 1D supramolecular polymers in the spiral are displaced alternately upwards and downwards with respect to the substrate normal , permitting the ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 17356 - 5 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 3578 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 17356 - 5 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications ﬂ uorinated alkyl chains to overlap each other . In such a packing model , the thickness of the nanosheet ( 4 . 3 nm ) appears to be inconsistent with the molecular length ( 6 . 9 nm ; Supplementary Figs . 11 and 15 ) . We infer that the dodecyl chains at the periphery of 6FF adopt a folded gauche conformation and ﬁ ll the space between the spirals ; this was corroborated by Fourier - transform infrared spectral measurements ( Supplementary Figs . 15 and 16 ) . Self - assembly mechanism of archimedean spiral . Cooling of a hot solution of 6FF in dodecane resulted in the formation of double - stranded Archimedean spirals irrespective of the cooling rate ( Sup - plementary Fig . 17 ) . Temperature - dependent absorption spectral measurements showed the presence of three distinct spectral sig - natures ( Fig . 3a ) . More precisely , on cooling 6FF from its molecularly dissolved state ( λ max = 420 nm ) , a red - shifted J - aggregate Soret band appeared at 434 nm as a shoulder ( 373 → 323 K ) , which was sub - sequently replaced by the blue - shifted H - aggregate Soret band at 403 nm ( 323 → 298 K ) . Previously , we characterized this J - aggregates as an off - pathway intermediate to the thermodynamically stable H - aggregates 22 , 23 . When a hot solution of 6FF was rapidly quenched in an ice bath ( 30 s ) , the J - aggregate state could be kinetically retained as a metastable state ; this subsequently underwent transformation into an H - aggregated Archimedean spiral ( Fig . 3b ) . Time - dependent changes in the absorbance exhibited sigmoidal kinetics ( Fig . 3c ) . AFM measurements in the early stages of the self - assembly captured the presence of smaller spirals with several turns ( Fig . 3d , e ) , which then grew larger at the expense of the J - aggregates ( Fig . 3f , g ) . These results indicate that the Archimedean spirals are formed through a cooperative nucleation – growth process . The area of the Archimedean spirals obtained after time - dependent evolution was polydisperse ( Đ = 1 . 40 , Supplementary Fig . 18 ) , suggesting that the primary nucleation process was occurring concurrently with the growth process , and its propagation was not controlled kinetically . Recently , mass - balance models have proven to be powerful tools for elucidating supramolecular polymerization mechanisms 35 – 38 . To quantify the thermodynamic parameters of the formation of the Archimedean spiral , a mass - balance model incorporating competi - tion between the isodesmic J - aggregation and the nucleated H - aggregation ( see Supplementary Information for full details ) was ﬁ tted to the temperature - dependent changes in absorbance 35 . To probe the formation of both types of aggregate , the absorbances at 434 and 403 nm were monitored ( Fig . 4a ) . Molar absorption coef ﬁ cients of 6FF in monomeric , J - aggregate , and H - aggregate forms were determined by separate experiments ( Supplementary Fig . 19 ) . The cooling curves were obtained for six different concentrations at a suf ﬁ ciently slow cooling rate ( − 0 . 5 K / min ) . As the Archimedean spiral was prone to precipitate at lower temperatures , as con ﬁ rmed by a Tyndall effect ( Supplementary Fig . 20 ) , we only used data points for temperatures at which < 65 % of 6FF molecules aggregated to form H - aggregates ( i . e . , the ﬁ lled marks in Fig . 4a ) . However , a global ﬁ t that treated the data sets of six different concentrations simultaneously with a single set of thermodynamic parameters proved to be unsuccessful ( Supplemen - tary Fig . 22 ) . Faced with this problem , we realized that changes in absorbance measured at higher ( reddish plots ) or lower concentra - tions ( bluish plots ) showed slightly different trends ( Fig . 4a ) , suggesting the presence of two very similar , yet subtly different aggregation pathways ( vide infra ) . As the very similar spectral properties of these aggregates prevented us to successfully ﬁ t the data , we selected appropriate data sets where only a single aggregate is observed . To our delight , global ﬁ ts using data sets obtained at higher concentrations ( 10 , 12 . 5 , and 15 μ M ) gave accurate thermodynamic parameters for the formation of the Archimedean spiral ( Fig . 4b and Supplementary Fig . 23 ) . Porphyrin 6FH was also capable of forming Archimedean spiral in dodecane , a process that was analyzed accordingly ( Supplementary Figs . 24 – 26 ) . Table 1 summarizes the resulting values .

For the off - pathway isodesmic J - aggregates , the difference in thermodynamic parameters is minor , suggesting that the aggregation in these off - pathway aggregates is primarily driven by interactions between the porphyrins . In contrast , the thermodynamic parameters for the formation of the H - aggregated Archimedean spiral are markedly different . As a result , the thermal stability of the Archimedean spirals of 6FF is slightly higher than that of 6FH , as indicated by the elongation temperatures of the spirals in 12 . 5 μ M solutions of 6FF and 6FH at 329 and 325 K , respectively ( Supplementary Fig . 28 ) , and by their critical aggregation concentrations of 1 . 7 × 10 − 8 and 14 (cid:2) ( π rad ) f r ( n m ) 0 80 20 60 40 Monomeric 6FF max = 420 nm Aggregated 6FF ( blue - shifted ) Nanosheet of 6HH ( splitted ) 7 π / 4 3 π / 2 5 π / 4 3 π / 4 π / 2 π / 4 0 h 350 450 500 Wavelength ( nm ) 400 a ( 10 5 L m o l c m ) 0 5 . 0 1 . 0 2 . 0 4 . 0 3 . 0 0 20 25 Distance ( nm ) 10 5 15 I n t en s i t y d e g b c 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 TEM AFM π Fig . 2 Self - assembly of 6FF . a Absorption spectra of supramolecular nanosheets of 6HH ( 50 μ M in methylcyclohexane at 283 K ) , Archimedean spirals of 6FF ( 12 . 5 μ M in dodecane at 298 K ) , and monomeric 6FF ( 12 . 5 μ M in dodecane at 373 K ) .

S2 ) . An increased thermal stability of supramolecular aggregates in the presence of an increased amount of ﬂ uorinated side chains has also been observed in liquid crystals 18 . In addition to the stronger enthalpic component for the formation of aggregates of 6FF , the entropic penalty for the formation of aggregates of 6FF is also considerably more negative than that for the aggregation of 6FH . This increased entropic penalty suggests that the side chains in the Archimedean spirals of 6FF are more organized and structured compared with those of 6FH . Pre - sumably , the poorer solubility of the ﬂ uorinated side chains in aliphatic environments drives this stronger organization . Thus , by balancing the degree of ﬂ uorination of the side chains , ﬁ ne control of thermal properties of the supramolecular structures is attainable . 434 ( 10 5 L m o l c m ) 0 . 2 0 . 8 0 . 4 0 . 6 403 ( 10 5 L m o l c m ) 0 . 4 1 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 2 a Temperature ( K ) b c M a ss f r a c t i on 0 100 60 20 80 40 303 343 353 323 313 333 Temperature ( K ) 303 343 353 323 313 333 Monomer Archimedean spiral J - aggregates Total 0 . 2 0 . 8 0 . 4 0 . 6 434 ( 10 5 L m o l c m ) 403 ( 10 5 L m o l c m ) 0 . 4 1 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 2 Temperature ( K ) 303 343 353 323 313 333 Fig . 4 Thermodynamic analysis . a Plots of molar absorption coef ﬁ cients at 434 and 403 nm as a function of temperature : [ 6FF ] = 2 . 5 , 5 . 0 , 7 . 5 , 10 . 0 , 12 . 5 , 15 . 0 μ M ; − 0 . 5 K / min .

The ‘ unsuccessful ’ global ﬁ t ( see above ) was indicative of the possible presence of a different self - assembled structure at lower con - centrations ( < 10 μ M ) , which we investigated by using AFM . As shown in Fig . 5 , we observed the presence of circular nanosheets with holes at their centers , closely resembling the Archimedean spiral described above . However , the 1D supramolecular poly - mers in each turn were found to be closed and nested , resulting in the formation of a concentric toroid ( Fig . 5a , b ) . Again , the separation distance between the toroids determined by AFM was larger than the length between the two ﬂ uorinated side chains in 6FF ( 3 . 5 nm ) , but ADF – STEM visualized the true separation distance between the consecutive toroids to be 3 . 2 nm ( Fig . 5c and Supplementary Fig . 29 ) . Absorption spectral measurements revealed that the concentric toroids consisted of H - aggregates , as in the case of the Archimedean spiral ( Supplementary Fig . 30 ) . However , a global ﬁ t to the two - pathway model by using only data points obtained at lower concentrations ( 2 . 5 , 5 . 0 , and 7 . 5 μ M ) did not yield a unique solution ( Supplementary Fig . 31 ) . These results indicate that the Archimedean spirals and the concentric toroids are similar in terms of their molecular packing , but differ in terms of their self - assembly mechanisms . As such , these two structures are in a unique relationship from the view - point of supramolecular polymorphism 14 , 39 – 42 . Under a diluted condition ( 5 . 0 μ M ) , 47 out of 50 circular nanosheets were con - centric toroids ( 94 % ) , while under a concentrated condition ( 12 . 5 μ M ) , 46 of them were double - stranded Archimedean spirals ( 92 % ) . This result demonstrates that difference in the self - assembly mechanism achieves remarkable selectivity even in the creation of such similar self - assembled structures . Controlled synthesis of concentric toroids . We reasoned that dilute conditions led to the preferential formation of toroids rather than spirals . The ﬂ uorinated surfaces of the resulting pri - mary toroids then serve as templates for the successive formation of new toroids through secondary nucleation ( Fig . 6a ) . This notion was corroborated by the fact that under the same condi - tions , 6FH failed to form multiple concentric toroids due to its weaker ﬂ uorophilic effect ( Supplementary Fig . 32 ) . We rarely observed unclosed toroids , indicating that 1D elongation along the circumference is much faster than secondary nucleation ( Fig . 6a , box ) . Nevertheless , because of the unique topology of the toroids , 1D elongation terminates at every toroid closure . As a result , these two propagation steps should occur alternately . We envisioned that this uncommon 2D growth mechanism permits the controlled synthesis of concentric toroids , provided that the number of the primary toroids can be de ﬁ ned . To shift the primary nucleation process to the kinetic regime , we applied a solvent - mixing protocol using a good and a poor solvent 6 , 43 . In a cuvette , dodecane ( a poor solvent ) was gently added over a solution of monomeric 6FF in toluene ( a good solvent ) and the mixture was then shaken vigorously for a second and left at 298 K ( see the “ Methods ” section ) . AFM measure - ments con ﬁ rmed that supramolecular concentric toroids were reproducibly obtained by this protocol . In addition , the presence of the good solvent apparently prevented precipitation of the concentric toroids . Absorption spectral measurements indicated that the J - aggregates were instantaneously formed upon solvent mixing and then transformed over time to form the H - aggregated concentric toroids ( Fig . 6b , c ) . To capture the self - assembly process , specimens for AFM observation were prepared at various times , as indicated by the arrows in Fig . 6c . Interestingly , the area ( A n ) of the concentric toroids increased proportionally against the degree of 6FF in concentric toroids determined by absorption spectral changes ( Fig . 6d – h , j , k ) . This result indicates that the number of the concentric toroids is practically constant throughout the propagation process , which is analogous to a controlled “ chain - growth polymerization ” process . Consequently , the solvent - mixing protocol afforded concentric toroids with a narrower polydispersity ( Đ = 1 . 18 ) than that of toroids obtained by the temperature - change protocol ( Đ = 1 . 44 ; Fig . 5a and Supplementary Fig . 33 ) .

NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 17356 - 5 ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2020 ) 11 : 3578 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 020 - 17356 - 5 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 7 monomeric 6FF in toluene to the resultant solution of concentric toroids further increased A n and A w to 44 , 000 and 49 , 700 nm 2 , respectively , while maintaining the low Đ value ( 1 . 13 ) ( Fig . 6i , j ) . Thus , mechanistic insights into the self - assembly permitted the controlled synthesis of an unusual supramolecular structure . Previously , George and colleagues 44 , 45 have successfully achieved 1D supramolecular polymers with a controlled length by similar seed formation in situ ( i . e . , without adding seeds externally ) . However , in practice , it would be dif ﬁ cult to extend this approach to 2D self - assembly that consists of 1D supramolecular polymerization and lateral growth , because each propagation process occurs with signi ﬁ cantly different kinetics 46 . We thus assert that the uncommon 2D self - assembly mechanism that stems from the unique concentric toroid structure played an important role in controlling the area of the circular nanosheets ( Fig . 6a ) . Recently , the topologies of self - assembled structures have been shown to in ﬂ uence their functions and properties ; e . g . , Yagai and colleagues 47 demonstrated an effect of topology on the kinetic stability of a supramolecular polymer . Our study illustrates a new topological effect that might be exploited in precise noncovalent syntheses 11 . Discussion This study illustrates the richness of self - assembled structures obtainable at higher hierarchical levels . It is remarkable that new and unusual self - assembled structures , such as double - stranded Archimedean spiral , could be obtained from a simple porphyrin molecule despite our previous systematic investigations on similar porphyrin derivatives 14 , 15 , 22 – 27 . By using mass - balance models , we found that the higher - order structure was stabilized by a lateral ﬂ uorophilic effect ; this was consistent with the molecular packing proposed on the basis of AFM , ADF – STEM , and SAXS results . Intriguingly , however , a global ﬁ t of a data set including data obtained at low concentrations failed ; this result led us to discover another unusual structure , that of supramolecular con - centric toroids . Having established the topologically de ﬁ ned self - assembly mechanism , this study also demonstrates a new topo - logical effect that could pave the way to controlled noncovalent syntheses . So far , complex structures have been created from inorganic materials 48 – 50 and block polymers 51 – 53 , and similarly , many unknown opportunities in molecular self - assembly can be expected at larger scales , re ﬂ ecting the recent advance in the understanding of the self - assembly mechanisms . Finally , it is interesting to note that a similar peculiar structure is used to achieve speci ﬁ c functions in some devices 54 as well as in a living system 55 . Methods Scanning transmission electron microscopy . Drops of the solutions were dis - persed on copper grids covered with 6 nm - thick amorphous carbon ﬁ lms . The grids were dried at room temperature . ADF – STEM observations were performed using electron microscopes ( Titan Cubed and Themis Z ; Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁ c , Inc . ) operated at 300 kV . The probe current and convergence semi - angle were set as 5 – 8pA and 18 – 25 mrad . The collection semi - angle range were set as 50 – 200 ( Fig . 2f and Supplementary Fig . 12 ) and 30 – 190mrad ( Fig . 5c and Supplementary Fig . 29 ) . Controlled synthesis of concentric toroids . In a 10mm×10mm cuvette , a solution of 6FF ( 100 μ M , 150 μ L ) in toluene was placed . On this solution , dodecane ( 2850 μ L ) was gently added , resulting in two separated organic layers . The cuvette was shaken vigorously for a second and then transferred to the sample compartment of a ultraviolet - visible ( UV - Vis ) spectrophotometer , which was kept at 298K : the con - centration and solvent ratio were [ 6FF ] = 5 μ M and toluene – dodecane = 1 : 19 ( v / v ) , respectively . After 20min , a solution of 6FF ( 50 μ M , 170 μ L ) in toluene was added to the resultant solution and UV - Vis spectral changes were continuously measured : the concentration and solvent ratio were [ 6FF ] = 7 . 4 μ M and toluene – dodecane = 1 : 9 ( v / v ) , respectively . Although the absorption spectral change was monitored at given times ( Fig . 6c ) , a solution ( 5 μ L ) was sampled and spin - coated on a HOPG substrate , which was dried under vacuum for AFM measurements .
