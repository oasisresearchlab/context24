We aimed to identify the effects independent of vaccination . 41 Data Sources : We searched EMBASE , PubMed and medRxiv up to January 2022 . Additional 42 studies were identified through contacting subject experts . 43 Study Selection : Two reviewers independently identified studies providing secondary 44 attack rates ( SAR ) for SARS - CoV - 2 infection in children ( 0 - 9 years ) , adolescents ( 10 - 19 years ) 45 or both compared with adults ( 20 years and older ) derived from household data . 46 Data Extraction and Synthesis : Two reviewers independently performed data extraction . 47 We assessed risk of bias of included studies using a critical appraisal checklist and a random - 48 effects meta - analysis model to pool association estimates . 49 Main Outcomes and Measures : Odds ratio ( OR ) for SARS - CoV - 2 infection comparing 50 children and adolescents with adults stratified by wild - type , Alpha , and Delta variant , 51 respectively . S usceptibility was defined as the secondary attack rate ( SAR ) among 52 susceptible household contacts irrespective of the age of the index case . Infectiousness was 53 defined as the SAR irrespective of the age of household contacts when 54 children / adolescents / adults were the index case . 55 Results : Twenty - eight studies ( 308 , 857 contacts ) were included in the susceptibility 56 analysis , for Delta only one ( large ) study was available . Compared to adults children and 57 adolescents were less susceptible to the wild - type and Delta variant , but equally susceptible 58 to the Alpha variant . In the infectiousness analysis , 21 studies ( 201 , 199 index cases ) were 59 included . Compared to adults , children and adolescents were less infectious when infected 60 with the wild - type and Delta variant . Alpha variant - related infectiousness remained unclear , 61 0 - 9 year old children were at least as infectious as adults . SAR among household contacts 62 was highest during circulation of the Alpha variant , lowest during wild - type circulation and 63 intermediate during Delta circulation . 64 Conclusions and Relevance : When considering the potential role of children and 65 adolescents , for each variant susceptibility , infectiousness , age group and overall 66 transmissibility need to be assessed to guide public health policy . 67 .

Children 75 aged 0 - 9 years old infected with the Alpha variant may be more infectious than adults , but 76 for adolescents , Alpha infectiousness is unclear . The overall secondary attack rate ( SAR ) rose 77 substantially from wild - type to Alpha and dropped somewhat from Alpha to Delta . 78 Meaning : The epidemiological role of children and adolescents towards SARS - CoV - 2 may be 79 influenced by susceptibility , infectiousness , variant , age group and overall ( relative ) 80 contagiousness . 81 .

Age - 84 disaggregated data reported to WHO show that children and adolescents are 85 underrepresented , particularly concerning severe disease and death 2 . Compared to children 86 and adolescents , adults are more vulnerable to severe forms of COVID - 19 , particularly those 87 with pre - existing comorbidities , older age , and other risk factors 3 - 6 . There is concern that 88 children could be a substantial , undetected source of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in the 89 community given their milder disease and higher frequency of asymptomatic infections 90 compared to adults 7 . A better understanding of their susceptibility and infectiousness 91 among children is important to inform the overall scale of the public health response , 92 including infection control strategies in kindergartens and schools , particularly as long as 93 many children may not be vaccinated 2 . 94 As new variants of concern ( VOCs ) emerged worldwide , the epidemiological effects 95 associated with their circulation also changed . Alpha and Delta variants have been shown to 96 be more transmissible than previous strains 8 . However , most studies have been performed 97 among adults , and it is unclear how viral evolution has affected susceptibility and 98 infectiousness of children and adolescents . A common approach often used to assess the 99 epidemiological properties of a given infectious agent is to measure transmission to 100 household contacts after introduction of the agent through an index case 9 . In general , 101 advantages of the household setting are that the transmission risk in households is high and 102 relatively similar in comparison to many other settings . In addition , results have a global 103 application ( despite cultural differences ) , and if there is potential for a virus or other agent 104 .

This study aimed to determine the relative SARS - CoV - 2 susceptibility and 108 infectiousness of SARS - CoV - 2 in children ( 0 - 9 years old ) and adolescents ( 10 - 19 years old ) 109 relative to adults , stratified by different viral variants ( wild - type , Alpha and Delta ) , based on 110 household contact data . We endeavour to identify the effect of the variants themselves 111 independent of the effect of vaccination . 112 113 METHODS 114 Protocol registration 115 This report was structured according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 116 Reviews and Meta - Analyses ( PRISMA ) statement guidelines 10 . The protocol was registered 117 with PROSPERO ( CRD42021271023 ) . 118 119 Eligibility criteria 120 Studies were included if they met the following eligibility criteria : ( A ) they reported 121 household secondary attack rates ( SAR ) or included the data required to compute 122 household SAR with the possibility to compare children ( 0 - 9 years old ) , adolescents ( 10 - 19 123 years old ) , or both combined ( 0 - 19 years old ) with adults ( 20 + years old ) ; ( B ) they tested—at 124 a minimum—all symptomatic household contacts for SARS - CoV - 2 infection by reverse 125 .

For wild - type studies , we included studies that 127 collected data before 2021 , i . e . , before VOCs Alpha and Delta began to circulate widely . 128 129 Information sources and search strategy 130 We formulated a search strategy to identify all relevant studies regardless of language or 131 publication status in EMBASE , MEDLINE , and medRxiv up to January 2022 . We used the 132 following index terms in PubMed : COVID , children , infectiousness , susceptibility and other 133 terms paraphrasing the infectiousness and susceptibility concepts . Full search terms are 134 included in supplementary Annex 1 . A ‘backwards’ snowball search was conducted of the 135 references in all included articles . Due to the likelihood of a high volume of relevant studies 136 for the wild - type virus , we followed standard guidelines for integrating existing systematic 137 reviews into new reviews 11 , 12 . Where existing systematic reviews with equivalent search and 138 study selection methods were available , these were used as a starting point to identify 139 relevant studies . 140 141 Study Selection 142 Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts . We obtained full reports for all 143 titles and abstracts that met the inclusion criteria or where there was any uncertainty . Full - 144 text articles were reviewed to assess eligibility , and exclusion reasons were coded . 145 Disagreements were resolved by consensus or by a third author if necessary . 146 .

The Covidence 148 systematic review software 13 was used for the screening and review processes , including 149 removal of duplicates . The reviewers independently used a pre - defined and piloted 150 standardized tool to extract data pertinent to the research questions . Two reviewers 151 independently extracted data from publications and reports and entered them in Microsoft 152 Excel . Extracted data included all the necessary information to describe and characterise the 153 studies , perform the quality assessments , synthesise data for the meta - analyses and assess 154 heterogeneity . In case of missing data or insufficient reporting of details , the studies’ 155 corresponding authors were contacted for clarification or with a request to recalculate data 156 to match age groups as used here . In addition , only data for unvaccinated persons were 157 used or requested for studies on the Delta variant ( which circulated when COVID - 19 158 vaccines were already broadly available ) . After data extraction was completed , codebooks 159 were reviewed , and any discrepancies were resolved by consensus or by a third author if 160 necessary . 161 162 The major categories of extracted data were : ( 1 ) study characteristics ( author , journal , year 163 of publication , country / region , funding sources ) ; ( 2 ) study design ( type of study , study 164 period , duration of follow - up ) ; ( 3 ) study population ( sample size at baseline , population 165 characteristics ) ; and ( 4 ) case definition of index and household secondary case ; ( 5 ) 166 vaccination status of participants . 167 168 .

Studies received as many as 9 points based on participant selection ( 4 points ) , 173 study comparability ( 1 point ) , and outcome of interest ( 4 points ) . Studies were classified as 174 having high ( ≤3 points ) , moderate ( 4 - 6 points ) , and low ( ≥7 points ) risk of bias . 175 176 Definitions , Data Synthesis and Analysis 177 We defined a “household” 15 as a group of people , often a family , who live together in a 178 house or flat . We defined an “index ( or primary ) case” as used in the studies themselves 179 ( eTable 1 ) , usually defined as either the first case to be confirmed in a household or the 180 confirmed case with the earliest date of symptom onset . “Household contacts” ( hhc ) were 181 defined as persons having been exposed to an index case and deemed susceptible 182 ( unvaccinated and – if available - with no history of SARS - CoV - 2 infection ) . A “secondary 183 case” was defined as a hhc with a positive RT - PCR test . The “household secondary attack 184 rate ( SAR ) ” was defined as the proportion of all hhc who were reported to have tested 185 positive for SARS - CoV - 2 divided by all susceptible hhc . We estimated susceptibility of an age 186 group as the SAR of hhc of that age group , irrespective of the age of the index case . 187 Infectiousness of an age group was the SAR of hhc ( irrespective of age ) exposed to index 188 cases in that age group . As a relative measure for susceptibility , we estimated odds ratios 189 ( OR ) comparing the SAR of children and / or adolescent hhc versus the SAR of adult hhc . As a 190 .

We defined children as those 0 - 9 192 years , adolescents as 10 to 19 years , and adults as 20 + years . In three studies a slightly 193 deviant age grouping was used which we accepted to be used for the three age groups 194 children / adolescents / adults ( Grijalva ( < 12 , 12 - 17 , 18 + ) 16 ; Koureas ( < 12 , 13 - 19 , 20 + ) 17 ; 195 Singanayagam 2021 ( 4 - 9 , 14 - 19 , 20 + ) 18 ) . We avoided unit - of - analysis error that could be 196 created by double - counting the participants in the multiple groups from one study , i . e . 197 children versus adolescents versus adults , by splitting the " shared " adult group into two by 198 dividing both the number of events ( infected ) and the total number of participants by 199 two 19 , 20 . To “isolate” the effect of the variants alone we extracted data on SAR among non - 200 vaccinated household contacts infected from non - vaccinated index cases . Thus , if studies 201 did not explicitly state that vaccination was an exclusion criterion , we felt it was reasonable 202 during wild - type and Alpha to assume that the index cases and household contacts were 203 previously uninfected and unvaccinated ( eTable 1 ) . 204 We pooled ORs across studies using the DerSimonian and Laird random - effects model due 205 to expected heterogeneity . We termed non - overlapping confidence intervals ( CI ) as 206 statistically significant ORs . The I 2 statistic was used to evaluate heterogeneity between 207 studies . We used an I 2 > 50 % as indicating statistically significant heterogeneity . All statistical 208 analyses were performed in R ( version 3 . 6 . 1 ) with freely available statistical packages ‘meta’ 209 ( version 5 . 2 . 0 ) 21 . 210 Data from Danish studies were of high quality . Results are therefore also presented 211 separately for these data in the analysis . The data from these studies were collected 212 consistently during circulation of all variants with the same methodology , had a large 213 .

Figure 1 shows the study selection flow 219 diagram . After deduplication and screening of articles using title and abstract , 218 full - text 220 articles were selected for critical examination . Of these , 190 articles were further excluded 221 because they failed to meet the inclusion criteria , largely , either because the results were 222 based on non - household or mixed contacts ( household / non - household not separated ) , or 223 no relevant outcome data were reported . The remaining 28 articles 16 - 18 , 22 - 46 involving 224 308 , 857 participants , met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review . Of the 28 225 studies , 18 ( 64 % ) were published in peer - reviewed journals , and 10 were accessible as pre - 226 prints . The studies were based on surveillance data ( n = 12 , 43 % ) , cohort study data ( n = 12 , 227 43 % ) , register data ( n = 3 , 11 % ) , and one retrospective case series ( n = 1 , 4 % ) . Most of the 228 studies were from China ( n = 8 , 32 % ) , followed by the United States of America ( n = 7 , 28 % ) . 229 The majority of included studies reported on the wild - type virus ( n = 21 , 75 % ) , followed by 230 Alpha variant ( n = 3 , 11 % ) , wild - type and Alpha ( n = 2 , 7 % ) , Delta ( n = 1 , 4 % ) , and wild - type , 231 Alpha and Delta ( n = 1 , 4 % ) . The supplementary file shows detailed information on data 232 extracted from each study in eTable 1 . The risk of bias in included studies is shown in eTable 233 2 . The study quality total rating score ranged from 5 to 9 of a total of 9 possible points . 234 Most of the studies were rated as having a low risk of bias ( n = 23 , 92 % ) and five studies were 235 rated as having a moderate risk of bias ( 18 % ) . 236 237 238 .

The reported SAR varied greatly across studies , ranging from 0 % to 56 % in children , 244 5 % to 47 % in adolescents and 12 % to 66 % in adults ( eFigure 1 ) . Moreover , the number of 245 contacts ( denominator ) varied from 2 ( in the children subgroup ) to 1 , 934 across studies , 246 implying large differences in the precision of the studies’ estimates . Heterogeneity of the 247 SAR was 94 % , 87 % and 99 % ( eFigure 1 ) , respectively , for the three age groups . The 248 heterogeneity for OR for SARS - CoV - 2 infection comparing children to adults and adolescents 249 to adults was smaller than the heterogeneity for the SAR ( 42 % and 0 % , respectively ; Figure 250 2 ) . Compared to adults , the OR for SARS - CoV - 2 infection in children was 28 % lower , 251 although not statistically significant ( OR = 0 . 72 , 95 % CI 0 . 49 - 1 . 05 , nine studies ) , whereas 252 Danish data yielded an OR of 0 . 84 ( 95 % CI 0 . 73 - 0 . 96 ) showing statistical significance 25 253 ( Figure 2 , 3 ) . Adolescents were 23 % less susceptible ( OR = 0 . 77 , 95 % CI 0 . 68 - 0 . 88 , nine 254 studies ) than adults ( Figure 2 , 3 ) . Both the pooled estimate derived from the studies 255 reporting on the 0 - 19 years old age group ( OR = 0 . 45 ; 95 % CI 0 . 27 - 0 . 76 , 11 studies ) as well as 256 the estimate pooled for children and adolescents ( OR = 0 . 59 , 95 % CI 0 . 45 - 0 . 77 , 20 studies ) 257 indicated statistical significance . 258 259 .

Children and adolescents were 349 less susceptible to the wild - type and likely the Delta variant but equally susceptible to the 350 Alpha variant as adults . Similarly , children and adolescents infected with the wild - type were 351 less infectious than adults and likely less infectious when infected with the Delta variant . 352 However , Alpha variant - related infectiousness is unclear ; possibly 0 - 9 year old children were 353 even more infectious than adults . The SAR among household contacts was lowest during 354 wild - type circulation , highest during circulation of the Alpha variant , and intermediate 355 during Delta circulation . 356 This type of information is generally valuable because households are an important “gear 357 changer” where infections may be lifted or moved down from one age group level ( e . g . 358 children ) to another ( adolescents , or parents in working age ) . Thus , it adds information on 359 the preferred directionality . For example , children often acquire influenza infection from 360 peers , introduce them into their households and their parents promote them in their own 361 age group , e . g . through the means of work contacts . This type of ( age stratified ) information 362 is particularly important at the beginning of a pandemic , because , i f children and 363 adolescents are more on the “receiving side” , closures of schools and / or daycare centers 364 with the aim to contain spread in the community should be highly scrutinized . 365 Our finding that children of 0 to 9 years and adolescents of 10 to 19 years were less 366 susceptible to the wild - type strain of SARS - CoV - 2 than adults , but as susceptible to the 367 .

The authors also described a wide range of SARs ; 369 however , they did not differentiate between children and adolescents . They stated that < 18 370 year old children experienced lower SAR in the household based on studies conducted 371 before the Alpha variant circulated 47 . Similarly , the meta - analysis of household studies by 372 Zhu 48 indicated a 38 % decreased susceptibility of children < 18 years old for the wild - type 373 strain ( OR = 0 . 62 , 95 % CI 0 . 42 - 0 . 91 ) . Irfan 49 and Viner 50 ( covering studies during wild - type 374 circulation ) disaggregated into children and adolescents and agreed in that the odds of 375 infection in children is significantly less than for adults , but stated that adolescents are as 376 susceptible or even more susceptible than adults . However , in contrast to our approach , 377 both studies included not only the household , but also other settings , which may explain the 378 difference to our results . 379 Several hypotheses have been proposed why SAR in children were found to be lower than 380 that in adults , such as lower probability of testing , lower viral load 51 or the activity , innate 381 immunity 52 , 53 or cross protection through cellular immunity from previous exposure to 382 seasonal corona viruses . At any rate , lower susceptibility of children compared to adults 383 stands in contrast to influenza , where several household studies have found that children 384 ( mostly pooled in broad age groups , e . g . < 18 years ) are more susceptible than adults 54 - 57 . 385 However , not all child age groups may be the same . When broken down into smaller age 386 groups one study conducted before the influenza pandemic ( A / H1N1 ) 2009 and another 387 conducted during the pandemic found that children younger than 6 and 5 years , 388 respectively , may be as susceptible as adults 56 , 58 . 389 390 .

Circulation of the Alpha 391 variant generally seems to have been associated with a substantially higher SAR among both 392 children and adolescents similar to that among adults . Evaluation of the Delta variant is 393 complicated by increasing vaccination coverage and prior infection . Only the Danish data 394 were able to analyse effects of the Delta variant alone , i . e . when exposure occurred in 395 households without prior infection , and from unvaccinated index cases to unvaccinated 396 household contacts . Results suggest that at least for the combined age group of 0 - 19 year 397 olds susceptibility is again lower compared to adults . Perhaps the Delta wave was the last 398 where the “true” effect of a variant alone , irrespective of vaccination and previous infection , 399 was possible in household contact studies as done here , because – as vaccine uptake 400 became widely available - restricting analysis to unvaccinated persons may introduce a bias 401 due to different adherence and attitudes towards recommended public health and infection 402 prevention measures . In addition , after the omicron wave the majority of the population 403 likely had experienced at least one , not always documented , SARS - CoV - 2 infection 59 . 404 405 Our analysis suggests that susceptibility and infectiousness of child age and adolescent age 406 groups in relation to adults has changed from variant to variant . However , it has not 407 changed in the same direction and magnitude . Thus , susceptibility and infectiousness may 408 have to be reassessed with every new variant anew . Although after the advent of VOC 409 omicron analyses restricting to unvaccinated index cases and unvaccinated household 410 contact persons have almost become impossible further household transmission studies are 411 warranted nevertheless . 412 413 .

We followed Cochrane 415 Collaboration , PRISMA , and GRADE recommendations , performed two comprehensive 416 searches , and used duplicate data extraction and risk of bias assessments by two 417 independent authors . Most of the included studies were at low risk of bias . Compared with 418 previous reviews 48 - 51 , 60 - 63 , we sought to further characterize the risk of both susceptibility 419 and infectiousness and we have undertaken pre - specified sub - group analyses by age group 420 ( by children as well as by adolescents ) and variant types . Furthermore , to improve 421 comparability , we have restricted our analysis to household contacts alone , while many 422 other studies mix in data from contact - tracing activities or do not differentiate between 423 household and non - household contacts . By analysing the susceptibility and infectiousness 424 relative to adults , we automatically were able to adjust for unknown conditions that may 425 influence the SAR within households in various ways , such as cultural behaviour or phase of 426 the pandemic . For example , the estimates of SAR of susceptibility for wild - type variants 427 were very heterogeneous for both children , adolescents , and adults ( eFigure 1 ) , whereas 428 the OR estimates were more homogenous ( Figure 2 ) . It is also a strength that one of the 429 authors ( FL ) contributed large data with the same study design ( register study ) and 430 methodology for all three variants . In addition to providing precise estimates from a large 431 number of households , using the same methods across time allows for comparisons , while 432 holding possible confounding conditions constant . 433 There are several limitations to our study . If household transmission is not closely 434 monitored the true primary case may not be the index case . As children / adolescents ( 0 - 19 435 year old ) are more frequently asymptomatic than adults 64 , it is possible that children ( and 436 .

Results of a childcare 438 outbreak / household study in Germany corroborate this consideration 38 . 439 We did not take the timing of the epidemic into account in this study ( e . g . , epidemic peak 440 vs . decline ) . We concentrated on variant - specific analyses . Depending on the timing of each 441 study , times of open or closed school or kindergartens ( due to mandate or vacation ) may 442 affect contact time within the household and – vice versa – limit contacts outside . 443 We did not extend our analysis to the Omicron variant mainly because of the dearth of 444 studies . A few studies indicate that both children and adults are more susceptible and more 445 infectious in regards to the Omicron variant compared to the Delta variant 66 which holds for 446 both BA . 1 as well as BA . 2 67 . However , this needs to be verified through further studies . 447 448 The results of the pooled data should be interpreted with caution , as in any active outbreak 449 response , there was high heterogeneity across studies in study design ( e . g . , follow - up 450 duration , frequency of testing , and universal and / or symptomatic testing ) , age groups were 451 not standardized , transmission mitigation strategies after index case diagnosis , follow - up , 452 testing strategies , household crowding , underlying seroprevalence , and other factors may 453 have differed . In particular , testing of children is prone to bias , as they may be less 454 frequently tested . Retrospective register ( surveillance ) studies may underestimate SAR in 455 general and especially for children . 456 457 .

It is possible that the index case in the family is not the primary case 48 . 460 We were unable to control for the chance of a ‘common exposure’ where two individuals 461 were infected by the same source at the same time , but one individual was incorrectly 462 identified as the sole index case of the cluster as they were the first to develop symptoms 48 . 463 Furthermore , concurrent community acquisition may be different for different age groups . 464 Likewise , it is important to note that these data should not be extrapolated to SARS - CoV - 2 465 transmission outside the home where older children and adolescents tend to have more 466 social contacts than adults 3 . 467 468 CONCLUSION 469 Our results show that children and adolescents are both susceptible and infectious to SARS - 470 CoV - 2 and their role in overall transmissibility likely changed with new variants emerging . 471 Children and adolescents were less susceptible to the wild - type and probably also the Delta 472 variant of SARS - Cov - 2 infection , they were less infectious when infected with the wild - type 473 and probably also when infected with the Delta variant . For the Alpha variant , data suggest 474 that children and adolescents were as susceptible as adults , and that children were at least 475 as infectious as adults . These results show the importance of understanding the relative 476 transmissibility of children and adolescents and the heterogeneity across variants . In 477 consequence , the relative susceptibility and infectiousness of children and adolescents may 478 have to be reassessed for every new variant anew . 479 .
