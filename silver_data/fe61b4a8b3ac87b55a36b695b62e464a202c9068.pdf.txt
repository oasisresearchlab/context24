Alexander 2 Published online : 10 February 2020 © Springer Nature B . V . 2020 Abstract The purpose of the current study was to : ( a ) examine the frequency of prior knowl - edge ( PK ) activation in elementary classrooms while students were engaged with text , ( b ) investigate the relevance of students’ responses to teacher prompts , ( c ) explore the nature of teachers’ and students’ prior knowledge activation utter - ances , and ( d ) investigate whether there were discernible routines in the interactions between teachers and students when activating PK . Participants were 6 teachers and 99 students from a private elementary school in the mid - Atlantic . An analy - sis of classroom discourse suggested that teachers infrequently prompted students to activate their prior knowledge during reading . Yet , when teachers did prompt PK , they asked about a prior lesson most often , or about a specific text , students’ world knowledge , or their personal experiences . Students then responded to their teachers according to the prompted referential frame . Additionally , four routines of classroom discourse were identified in the data including nonresponsive , question – answer , simple feedback , and interaction routines , with less elaborate routines being most common and primarily occurring at the beginning of lessons . Keywords Prior knowledge · Prior knowledge activation · Classroom discourse Introduction The role of prior knowledge in learning from text is among the best - established find - ings in contemporary education research ( e . g . , Alexander , Kulikowich , & Schulze , 1994 ; Bransford & Johnson , 1972 ; Kintsch & Mangalath , 2011 ) . In their review of language terminology , Alexander , Schallert , & Hare ( 1991 ) defined prior knowledge * Courtney Hattan cahatta @ ilstu . edu 1 School of Teaching and Learning , Illinois State University , Campus Box 5330 , Normal , IL 61761 , USA 2 Department of Human Development and Quantitative Methodology , University of Maryland , 3304 Benjamin Building , College Park , MD 20742 , USA 1618 C . Hattan , P . A . Alexander 1 3 as “the sum of what an individual knows” ( p . 333 ) and described its continuous and significant influence throughout the processing of text . Therefore , in this study , we operationalize prior knowledge as being any knowledge or information that a student brings to a learning situation , including their world , textual , or personal knowledge . This knowledge can be obtained through formal instruction and explicit knowledge building , acquired via text processing , or assimilated through informal , everyday experiences . Echoing that description , Anderson and Pearson ( 1984 ) represented reading comprehension as “the interaction of new information with old knowledge” ( p . 255 ) , suggesting a bidirectional and continuous interaction between textual infor - mation and individuals’ prior knowledge . In effect , the activation of prior knowledge simultaneous with the processing of textual content is required to build inferences ( Kintsch , 2000 ) , remember content ( Pressley , Johnson , Symons , McGoldrick , & Kurita , 1989 ) , and understand the sig - nificance or relevance of what is read ( Alexander , 1999 ) . Even as reading unfolds , new information that students encounter can potentially be assimilated into their existing knowledge base and influence their comprehension of what is subsequently processed ( Anderson & Pearson , 1984 ) . The purpose of prior knowledge activation ( PKA ) , or teachers’ intentional priming of what students’ may already know or have experienced relative to the content , is to facilitate that interaction between reader and text . Activating prior knowledge may seem intuitive or effortless for most students during typical text processing events ( Kintsch , 1988 ) . Yet , the process of activation or instantiation of relevant background knowledge or experiences may well be inten - tional and effortful , or require teacher scaffolding when personal connections to the text are tenuous . Teacher guidance may also be necessary when the text or reading tasks are particularly demanding ( Alexander , 2005 ; Carr & Thompson , 1996 ; Hynd & Alverman , 1989 ) . Given the extensive literature that exists on prior knowledge and its role in text - based learning , we first overview what has been established in theory and in practice about this foundational interaction over the past three decades . Prior knowledge in theory As evidence of its importance , prior knowledge is a key component of theories of learning and text processing ( Anderson , Reynolds , Schallert , & Goetz , 1977 ; Aus - ubel , 1968 ; Kintsch , 1988 ) . For instance , one of the principal topics investigated in the reading literature during the 1980s was schema theory ( Anderson et al . , 1977 ) , which dominated the reading literature for more than a decade ( see Gaffney & Anderson , 2000 ) . Schema theory sought to explain how individuals’ knowledge was organized in the mind and instantiated during learning . It was text processing that served as the principal milieu for validating the tenets of this theory . Further , there was a concomi - tant rise in prior knowledge research during this timeframe as a result of the empirical evidence for the power of knowledge activation exerted in text - based learning . In articulating the tenets of schema theory , Anderson ( 1984 ) acknowledged the foundational work of Ausubel’s Subsumption Theory ( 1968 ) . Specifically , in Sub - sumption Theory , Ausubel stressed the importance of meaningful learning over rote 1619 1 3 Prior knowledge and its activation in elementary classroom… learning , where meaningful learning is driven by what learners know or have expe - rienced . Ausubel ( 1968 ) argued that rote learning stresses memorization and , thus , can be isolated from individuals’ existing knowledge base . In contrast , meaningful learning , as conceptualized in Subsumption Theory , is contextualized and occurs when learners incorporate new information into existing cognitive structures ( Aus - ubel , 2000 ) . This focus on meaningful learning , which places value on the students’ existing knowledge and experiences , was mirrored in Schema Theory that Anderson et al . ( 1977 ) articulated over a decade later . Although arising from a different theoretical framework , Kintsch’s Construction Integration Model ( CIM ) of Text Comprehension ( 1988 ) similarly stresses a bidirec - tional and continuous interaction between the text and the reader . According to CIM , the reader - text interaction is captured by the continuous interplay between the text - base and the situation model . So conceptualized , comprehension of any text , written or oral , is predicated on the interjection of readers’ existing knowledge with the message conveyed by the authored text . In other words , readers integrate the text with their existing knowledge base , and draw on that integrated understanding to recall , sum - marize or answer questions about the text . During the reading process , readers con - tinually activate their prior knowledge , strengthening connections between the text and prior knowledge , while also discarding existing knowledge that is not useful to the current reading task . By assimilating new information into existing knowledge struc - tures , readers often transform what they know or understand about the topic at hand . Prior knowledge in practice The importance of activating prior knowledge is not only central to models of learning and reading comprehension ( e . g . , Ausubel , 1968 ; Kintsch , 1998 ) , but also emerges as significant in empirical studies of text processing . During the 1980s , extensive investigations of prior knowledge activation in text comprehension were undertaken ( e . g . , Hayes & Tierney , 1982 ; Peeck , van den Bosch , & Kreupeling , 1982 ) . These empirical research studies demonstrated that prior knowledge and its activation are crucial to the process of comprehension . As a result , researchers investigated various techniques meant to prompt the activation of students’ prior knowledge ( e . g . , Alvermann , Smith , & Readence , 1985 ; Woloshyn , Willoughby , Wood , & Pressley , 1990 ) . Outcomes of these studies often documented significant , positive effects for knowledge activation on text comprehension ( Beishuizen , Ass - cher , Prinsen , & Elshout - Mohr , 2003 ; Gurlitt & Renkl , 2010 ) . Moreover , there was evidence that instructors’ efforts to activate students’ knowl - edge should reflect how much relevant knowledge students might have available . In effect , students with lower levels of relevant knowledge were viewed as needing additional support or a different instructional technique than students with higher levels of knowledge ( e . g . , Gurlitt & Renkl , 2008 ; Wetzels , Kester , & van Merriën - boer , 2011 ) . In addition , instructors were advised to consider the veracity or accu - racy of students’ knowledge , given that the activation of inaccurate knowledge was found to hinder , rather than aid , comprehension ( Alvermann et al . , 1985 ; Braasch 1620 C . Hattan , P . A . Alexander 1 3 & Goldman , 2010 ; Lipson , 1982 ) . However , when teachers alerted students to the possibility that their knowledge could be misleading ( i . e . , augmented activation ) , students more effectively dealt with the inconsistencies between their limited under - standings and the new information in text ( e . g . , Alvermann & Hague , 1989 ) . To date , much of the research on prior knowledge activation techniques , with few exceptions ( e . g . , Kiili , Laurinen , Marttunen , & Leu , 2012 ; Stahl , 2008 ) has been con - ducted in laboratory - like contexts ( Gurlitt & Renkl , 2010 ; Wood , Willoughby , Kas - par , & Idle , 1994 ) rather than in classrooms or naturalistic settings ( Biemans , Deel , & Simons , 2001 ; Machiels - Bongaerts , Schmidt , & Boshuizen , 1995 ) . This is unfor - tunate , since classroom discussions involving texts are fertile environments for such investigations , where ongoing interactions between students and teachers can reveal much about teachers’ activation behaviors and routines , as well as about the nature of students’ responses ( Anderson et al . , 2001 , Alexander , Schallert , & Reynolds , 2009 ) . Additionally , there is ample evidence that different patterns of teacher - student dis - course operate within classrooms contexts , such as recitation ( Alvermann , O’Brien , & Dillon , 1990 ) , open exchange ( Cobb et al . , 1991 ) , student - interactive learning ( Perret - Clemont , Perret , & Bell , 1991 ) , and peer tutoring ( Fuchs , Fuchs , Mathes , & Simmons , 1997 ) . Perhaps the most common interaction routine within classrooms has been the Ini - tiate - Response - Evaluate ( IRE ; Mehan , 1979 ) pattern in which teachers ask questions , stu - dents respond , and the teacher offers minimal feedback . What has not been ascertained , however , is whether these general discourse routines are replicated when the focus is expressly on episodes of prior knowledge activation . More information is needed to deter - mine whether teachers’ efforts to unearth their students’ existing understandings or prior experiences give rise to alternative discourse routines . The purpose of the current study , therefore , was to investigate that question in an effort to better understand the ways in which teachers guide students to activate their prior knowledge during classroom lessons . Current educational context Despite the wealth of research conducted on prior knowledge and its activation in the 1980s and 1990s , there has been limited activity in the explicit study of prior knowl - edge for several decades , with certain exceptions ( e . g . , Hattan , 2019 ; Lupo , Tortorelli , Invernizzi , Ryoo , & Strong , 2019 ) . Gaffney and Anderson ( 2000 ) suggested that this lack of focus was due to education researchers , “not commit [ ing ] themselves to the specific theoretical content associated with schema” ( p . 63 ) . Instead , researchers took the concept of schema theory in many different directions in ensuing decades , often focusing more generally on comprehension . However , this gap in prior knowledge research in no way signals any decrement in the essential role that prior knowledge is presumed to play in students’ understanding and learning from text . Instead , prior knowledge has routinely been included as an influential factor or explanatory vari - able in literacy studies ( Guthrie , Taboada , & Coddington , 2007 ) . For instance , prior knowledge has frequently been used as a covariate or predictor variable in empirical studies of text - based learning and reading performance ( Ozuru , Dempsey , & McNa - mara , 2009 ) . However , it has rarely been the focus of such research . 1621 1 3 Prior knowledge and its activation in elementary classroom… Thus , the goal of the current study was to bring back a line of research that centers on prior knowledge , revisiting issues that have been put aside for some time . Investi - gations into prior knowledge and its activation are particularly timely given the heavy focus on the comprehension of complex , informational texts in the Common Core State Standards ( CCSS , 2012 ) . Specifically , following the example set by the National Assessment of Educational Progress ( National Assessment Governing Board , 2010 ) , the CCSS recommends that about half of the texts that elementary students read should include content - rich nonfiction texts , with the purpose of building students’ knowl - edge . This concern for building students’ knowledge not only renews a concern for knowledge acquisition , but also necessitates some understanding of what students may already know about the subject at hand . It also reignites interest in techniques that allow educators to unearth students’ existing knowledge within the flow of instruction . Regrettably , despite this growing awareness that prior knowledge remains cen - tral to the reading process ( Cervetti & Hiebert , 2015 ; Pearson & Cervetti , 2015 ) , it can be argued that educational researchers and practicing teachers may be less informed about how to activate such knowledge effectively ( Hattan , Singer , Lough - lin , & Alexander , 2015 ) . There may be even less grasp of what particular techniques would seem more useful under varying learning conditions or with certain types of learners ( Hattan et al . , 2015 , Hattan & Alexander , 2018 ) . Further , there seems to be an overreliance on knowledge activation prompts that occur prior to reading ( e . g . , the know - want to know - learned [ KWL ] chart ; Ogle , 1986 ; Lupo et al . , 2019 ) , rather than throughout the reading process , as supported theoretically and empiri - cally ( Hattan , 2019 ; Kintsch , 1998 ) . Thus , rather than taking activation for granted , it seems prudent to investigate how prior knowledge activation occurs during actual classroom lessons involving real teachers , real students , and unaltered texts . Current study As indicated , there remains limited understanding on how the activation process unfolds in the flow of classroom instruction and teachers’ role in that process , despite what is known about the essentialness of students’ existing knowledge in their learning from text . For instance , how frequently do teachers explicitly prompt students to consider or share their topic - relevant knowledge and how do students respond to those prompts ? What routines do teachers employ to facilitate students to reflect on what they know of a topic before or as they read about that topic ? The purpose of the current investigation was to address such questions by quantitatively and qualitatively examining teachers’ prompting of their students’ prior knowledge during language arts and social studies instruction . We also explored the nature of the connections that students forged as a result of such promptings . In the current study , we wanted to examine the place of prior knowledge activation within classroom contexts . Specifically , we set out to build on findings from previous investigations in several ways . First , previous studies on PK activation have primarily focused on secondary or undergraduate students , often within lab - like settings ( Gurlitt 1622 C . Hattan , P . A . Alexander 1 3 & Renkl , 2010 ; Wood et al . , 1994 ) . Therefore , investigating knowledge activation within upper elementary classrooms where lessons combined language arts and social studies content afforded a complement to what has already been established about the relation between prior knowledge and reading comprehension at other developmental levels and in other settings . Second , in a previous investigation of PK activation in upper elementary language arts lessons , we explored classroom discourse in a public school that primarily served a low - income community ( Hattan et al . , 2015 ) . Teachers in that study rarely prompted students’ prior knowledge ( i . e . , 1 . 5 % of coded teacher utterances ) . Although there are no established standards regarding how frequently stu - dents’ background knowledge should be activated during instruction , such a small per - centage of instructional time devoted to what students may know or have experienced relative to their readings must be questioned ( van den Broek , Mouw , & Kraal , 2016 ) . Thus , we were curious as to whether similar outcomes would emerge when the teach - ers served middle - income students and had substantial curricular freedom . Third , previous analyses of prior knowledge activation and classroom discourse only considered teacher talk , rather than also examining corresponding student talk ( Hat - tan et al . , 2015 ) . Our focus in this investigation was not only on how , when , and how often teachers prompted their students to think about what they knew or have experi - enced relative to a specific reading , but also how students responded to such prompts . In effect , when these opportunities occurred in the flow of instruction , did students offer relevant information or describe pertinent experiences that might enrich their compre - hension ( Pearson & Cervetti , 2015 ) ? Or , did these occasions elicit seemingly tangential or irrelevant content from the students that could potentially distract from the textual content ? Further , we were interested in whether students shared their knowledge and experiences freely without prompting or only when called upon to do so , and whether the students’ responses were brief and unelaborated or descriptive and elaborated . Finally , we wanted to look deeper into classroom discourse by investigating the pattern of teacher - student interactions during literacy instruction . Previous discourse studies have noted the prevalence of simple question – answer - response routines such as the oft - practiced Initiate - Respond - Evaluate ( IRE ) pattern ( Cazden & Beck , 2003 ; Mehan , 1979 ) . Thus , in this study , we wanted to investigate what interaction pat - terns would be identified in the discourse of the teachers and students we observed and whether those identified patterns parallel those described in the literature . We also sought to ascertain when prior knowledge activation occurred during the flow of instruction . Does this happen almost exclusively at the beginning of lessons , or throughout the lesson as has been recommended ? By being able to record and cat - egorize students’ talk in association with their teachers’ verbalization , the present study added a missing dimension to prior studies . The specific research questions that guided this study were : 1 . How frequently do teachers prompt students to think about what they know or have experienced relative to what is being read in upper elementary classrooms where lessons combine language arts and social studies instruction ? 2 . How frequently do students share what they know or have experienced during the flow of classroom instruction and how can these sharings best be characterized ? 1623 1 3 Prior knowledge and its activation in elementary classroom… Are these sharings offered freely or in response to teacher prompting ; are they unelaborated or more extensive ; and , are they relevant or tangential to the lesson ? 3 . What forms of prompts do teachers use when activating students’ knowledge and what is the form of students’ response to those prompts ? In other words , what referential frames or sources of knowledge can be identified in teacher prompts and student responses , and do teacher and student utterances occur before , during , or after reading ? 4 . What patterns of classroom discourse can be discerned during knowledge acti - vation and when , during the flow of classroom instruction , are these patterns observed ? Method School context and participants Data were collected from a secular private elementary school in the mid - Atlantic region . The pre - kindergarten through fifth - grade school serves just over 200 students , primarily from middle - income families . Admission to the school is selective , requiring an admissions exam and interview . However , students are admitted without regard to race , sex , or national origin . The school also offers scholarships for students from low - income families . Rather than being required to use a specific curriculum or reading series , teachers at this school are free to decide what texts they will use and what les - sons they will teach . These teachers are also not required to adhere to state or national standards and the students do not participate in high - stakes standardized assessments . Yet , upon high - school graduation , 100 % of the students attend college or university . Participants in this study were two 3rd grade teachers , two 4th grade teachers , and two 5th grade teachers , and their students . All 6 teachers were White females , had bach - elor’s degrees in education , and each had over 5 years of teaching experience . A total of 99 students participated in the study , with an average of 16 . 5 students per class ( range 15 – 18 ) . Students were primarily White ( n = 88 ) , with Asian / Pacific Islander ( n = 5 ) , African American ( n = 4 ) , and Latinx ( n = 2 ) students represented as well . Because there were no standardized assessment data by which to establish students’ reading lev - els , we relied on the judgments of their teachers to gauge their abilities . According to their teachers , 27 students were reading above grade level , 61 were considered at - grade level , and 11 students were characterized as reading below grade level . Data sources Prior to data collection , the first author met with the principal and teachers at the school site . All 3rd through 5th grade classrooms were invited to participate in the study , and all chose to do so . Teachers were informed that the data would be used to examine classroom discourse but were not told that the specific focus of the study was prior knowledge activation . 1624 C . Hattan , P . A . Alexander 1 3 The researchers and school administrators sent a letter home to students’ families , informing them that a researcher would be recording students’ voices during classes . Parents provided waived consent for their children to participate in the study , and stu - dents assented to their participation . One student opted not to participate in the study , and therefore his responses were eliminated from the transcript and not utilized in the analyses . Additionally , teachers signed a consent form prior to data collection . Data collection occurred during combined language arts and social studies blocks . The researchers requested that the observed lessons include whole - class discourse , as well as engagement with text . Given those requirements , the teachers informed the researchers of convenient dates and times to conduct the observations . Within this school , language arts , reading and social studies were combined in the same instruc - tional block . Therefore , the observed lessons involved reading , writing , and discus - sion around social studies content and typically focused on historical fiction or non - fiction texts . These texts ranged in length from brief snippets to book chapters . Data sources for the study were audio recordings of teacher and student talk coded by utterances , defined as each complete thought expressed by an individual ( Ford & Thompson , 1996 ; Fig . 1 ) . To best capture classroom discourse , we focused on whole - group rather than small - group instruction or individual work time . Obser - vations and audio recordings occurred over the course of two lessons for each teacher , with each lesson lasting approximately 50 min . The purpose of observing two lessons rather than one was to gather more data , as the lessons did not occur on back - to - back days . Additionally , by observing two lessons , there was less of a chance that we would observe a more atypical lesson . This resulted in 12 episodes of classroom discourse that were transcribed and then parsed into utterances . See Table 1 for a list of topics discussed during each lesson .

Alexander 1 3 Coding scheme A six - step procedure was followed to examine classroom discourse . First , recordings of classroom conversations were transcribed verbatim . Second , the classroom tran - scripts were broken down into utterances , defined as a complete thought . The first author trained an assistant in the procedure for identifying utterances with the tran - scripts . Interrater agreement on 2 ( 17 % ) of the 12 lessons was 93 % , with differences resolved in discussion . Given the high level of interrater agreement , the remaining utterances were coded by the first author . Third , those teacher utterances expressly related to prior knowledge activa - tion were identified according to a coding scheme described in an ensuing section . Fourth , a comparable process for identifying student utterances related to prior knowledge activation was undertaken and is detailed in the subsection entitled “stu - dent utterances . ” Interrater agreement for steps three and four , identifying and cat - egorizing teacher and student discourse , was 99 % ( K = . 98 ) for 33 % of utterances , with all remaining transcripts scored by the first author . Fifth , each teacher and student prior knowledge activation utterance was coded according to referential frame and marked as to whether the utterance occurred before , during , or after reading . In addition , each teacher prompt was coded accord - ing to its apparent purpose . This process is described in an ensuing section . Inter - rater agreement for step five of the coding process , categorizing prior knowledge activation utterances , was 96 % for 33 % of utterances , with all remaining utterances scored by the first author . Finally , pattern coding ( Huberman & Miles , 1994 ) was utilized to qualitatively examine the flow of utterances between teachers and students . Pattern coding is an appropriate second - cycle coding methodology that allows researchers to search for rules and explanations within a dataset ( Saldaña , 2013 ) . Within classroom dis - course , we used pattern coding to qualitatively discern if there were particular inter - action routines that could be identified , and when those routines took place . Teacher utterances In an effort to gain a clearer understanding of overall teacher talk , teacher utterances were coded into ten categories , using O’Flahavan , Hartman , and Pearson’s ( 1989 ) coding scheme as a guide . Prior knowledge activation utterances were those that guided students to make connections to past experiences ( e . g . , “You guys were worried about an outbreak of which disease in the world ? ” ) , previous content ( e . g . , “We’ve talked about the five themes of Geography” ) other texts ( e . g . , “Can you give me an example from the book we read yesterday ? ) , or real - world knowledge ( e . g . , “What does it mean to be an explorer ? ” ) . For the purposes of the current study , prior knowledge included all knowledge students brought to the learning environment . Therefore , knowledge gleaned from classroom instruction or the text on a previous day was considered to be prior knowledge , but information presented during the observed class period or in the current text was not considered as prior knowledge . 1627 1 3 Prior knowledge and its activation in elementary classroom… Text explicit / literal utterances are those that require an explicit reference to the text , and generally refer to detail of a story or require literal comprehension . An example of text explicit / literal utterances is , “Okay , so what do we know about the neighbors so far ? ” Text implicit / inferential utterances require inference in order to create a plausible answer , and often require readers to examine more than one sen - tence to construct an answer , such as the question “From whose perspective is the letter written ? ” or “Are they free Blacks ? ” Evidence utterances include questions that ask students to provide evidence from the text to support their answer , such as , “Who can give me an example of what Jesse ( pseudonym ) just said ? ” Opinion / unsubstantiated evaluation are elicitations that ask students to express their feelings or reactions , such as “Anybody else want to give your opinion ? ” or “Is that problem - atic ? ” Utterances that require prediction or conjecture ask students what they think will happen next , or ask students to hypothesize about situations that are related to the text . For example , “How’s he going to do that ? ” Teacher evaluation / feedback are utterances that include judgments that a teacher makes regarding a student’s response , such as , “yes , ” “no , ” “okay , ” or “that’s a good point . ” Information / content sharing utterances occur when teachers present content to students , such as “So three ships sailed from England in 1607 , ” or the teacher shares her own ideas or opinions about the text , such as “I don’t think the book clarifies it very well . ” Additionally , two categories referred to utterances meant to manage students , such as “Let’s try to talk one at a time , ” or manage tasks , such as “Circle the correct answer . ” All teacher utterances were coded according to the cat - egories listed above . Although the primary focus of this study was on prior knowl - edge activation , we coded all teacher talk to capture a more comprehensive picture of teacher utterances over the twelve observed lessons . Student utterances First , student utterances that encompassed the activation of prior knowledge were discriminated from other utterances . Only prior knowledge activation utterances were analyzed further . Similar to our operationalization of prior knowledge within teacher utterances , we considered any utterance where students shared knowledge learned from previous lessons , texts , or out - of - school experiences to represent their prior knowledge . Second , students’ prior knowledge activation utterances were coded as explicit or unsolicited . Explicit activation is when a student responds to a teacher prompt . For example , a teacher asked , “And did the book talk about there being other free blacks near him ? ” and a student responded “Nope . ” Unsolicited activation occurs without direct prompting from the teacher . For instance , during a conversation about the relationship between Columbus and Native Americans , one student said , “And didn’t he , like , kidnap them or something ? ” In this situation , the teacher did not explicitly prompt students’ knowledge activation , yet the student brought up a point that was applicable to the conversation . Third , each student’s prior knowledge activation utterances were coded as irrel - evant or relevant . Irrelevant utterances occurred when a student response was off topic or not appropriate for the current classroom conversation . For example , during 1628 C . Hattan , P . A . Alexander 1 3 a conversation about the definition of “persecution , ” a tangential side conversation occurred about the snack food Twinkies . A student stated , “I tried them [ Twink - ies ] once , ” but this connection did not assist the student in better understanding the vocabulary word “persecution . ” One example of a relevant utterance was , “Well , actually , Columbus only has a limited amount of gunpowder , ” which occurred dur - ing a conversation about resources that Columbus and Native Americans possessed . Fourth , each prior knowledge activation utterance was further coded according to whether or not the response was limited or extended . A limited utterance lacked detail or explanation and included one or two - word responses such as “yes” or “Rus - sia . ” An extended response included further elaboration . For example , in response to the knowledge activation prompt ( i . e . , What does fare mean ? ) , a student responded , “Passenger with the lowest fare . How much they paid for the ticket . ” Nature of prior knowledge activation After initial rounds of coding were completed , we returned to the data to re - code each teacher and student utterance with regard to their source or referential frame and whether the utterances occurred before , during , or after reading . Referential frame Teacher PK prompts and student responses were coded according to their referential frame , or knowledge source , based on Hattan et al . , ( 2015 ) coding scheme . Referencing a previous lesson occurred when the teacher or students referred back to something that was learned in an earlier lesson . These utterances could have referenced a specific lesson ( Teacher : “Yesterday , we talked about an outbreak of which disease in the world ? ” Student : “Ebola” ) , or content associated with a specific lesson ( Teacher : “What was happening when [ Lincoln ] was president that he would want to talk about peace and balance and things like that ? ” Student : “The Civil War” ) . The referential frame general world knowledge was coded when the teacher asked the students about a topic or event that was not explicitly addressed in the lesson but presumed to be part of their life experiences or general knowledge ( Teacher : “When butterflies migrate , do they migrate and stay there forever ? ” Student : “No they go to Mexico for warmth . They go down in the winter and then they come back” ) . There were also occasions when the teacher prompted students to consider a specific text they had read on a previous occasion that was seen as relevant to the day’s lesson ( Teacher : “Remember when we read chapter 2 ? What did the author say that was important to Benjamin Banneker ? ” ) . There were also situations when students ref - erenced a text they had read on their own . ( Teacher : So is it just making a mind movie or are there other senses involved in imagery ? Student : I’m reading Harry Potter and it describes all these different feasts for holidays . So when they describe the food I feel like I can almost smell it” ) . Finally , there were times when the teacher would ask students about personal experiences that may have relevance to the con - tent of the lesson ( Teacher : “The lesson today focuses on taking responsibility . What kind of responsibilities do you have in your family ? Student : “I have to clean the bathroom” ) . 1629 1 3 Prior knowledge and its activation in elementary classroom… Before , during , or after reading We also coded teacher and student PK utterances according to whether they occurred before , during , or after reading . However , as dem - onstrated in Table 1 , only five of the twelve lessons encompassed before , during , and after reading components , with the remaining classroom conversations focused pri - marily on only one component ( two before reading , one during reading , and four after reading ) . For the before - reading lessons , which both occurred in 4th grade classrooms , one lesson involved the introduction of a new chapter book , while the other was a rich conversation where the teacher had planned to move on and read additional portions of the text but did not have time to do so . For the during - reading lesson we observed , the 4th grade teacher jumped right into reading , without setting up the text or summariz - ing what had been read previously . For the four after - reading lessons , which included two 4th grade and two 5th grade lessons , students had been required to read chapters for homework the night before . Thus , the purpose of the lessons was to review , sum - marize , and discuss the previously read text content within a classroom setting . Further , each teacher’s PK utterances were coded according to its perceived purpose . Prompts were coded if they were meant to remind students of something ( e . g . , “Remember when we talked about Hitler the other day ? ” ) or assess students’ recall of previously taught content ( e . g . , “What did we learn that vintage means in last week’s reading ? ” ) . There were also occasions when the teacher PK activation prompts were meant to clarify ambiguities that arose in discussion such as “Why would they be able to send Justin Bieber to Canada ? ” Finally , there were times when the teacher’s prompt to students was meant to motivate them or establish the rel - evance of lesson content ( Teacher : “Have you ever seen a painting , read a book , or listened to music that excited you or made you feel happy ? ) . Patterns in prior knowledge activation Rather than relying solely on specific utterances as a source of insights into prior knowl - edge activation , we wanted to investigate this phenomenon at a more macro - level . For this macro - level analysis , we wanted to determine if there were recurring routines in the way teachers engaged in prior knowledge activation in their classrooms . To achieve this goal , we undertook a multiple - step process . First , we returned to the transcripts used in the prior analysis . However , to identify patterns within the discourse , we targeted con - versational turns instead of individual utterances . Simply defined , a conversational turn refers to all talk that occurred before a change in speaker . Next , we marked all conver - sational turns initiated by teachers that included a prior knowledge activation prompt . With those specific turns identified , we then tracked the ensuing routines in turn - tak - ing between teacher and students following a teacher’s prompting of students’ exist - ing knowledge or previous experiences . All conversational turns were tracked in this manner until another activation prompt occurred or until that conversational thread was terminated . For each of these conversational “chunks , ” we then indicated the speaker as the teacher , T , or her individual students ( i . e . , S 1 , S 2 …S n ) . Further , using this procedure we were able to indicate when in a lesson these interactions occurred . All twelve transcripts were examined to determine what activation patterns occurred across teachers and lessons . We also sought converging evidence of these identified activation routines from the literature dealing with general classroom discourse routines 1630 C . Hattan , P . A . Alexander 1 3 ( Cazden & Beck , 2003 ; Chinn , Anderson , & Waggoner , 2001 ; Mehan , 1979 ; Redfield & Rousseau , 1981 ) . However , it should be noted that the focus on whole - class conver - sations restricted potential knowledge activation routines . In other words , more student to student interactions may have been identified if there was a focus on small group discussion , rather than whole - class interactions . Results and discussion Frequency of activation prompts To address the first research question , we counted the number of teacher utterances related to the activation of students’ existing knowledge and experience and com - pared the frequency of those utterances to all others . The frequency and percentages of teachers’ utterances by specific teacher , category , and lesson are displayed in Table 2 . Across all twelve episodes of classroom discourse , there were a total of 6338 teacher utterances , 3473 instructional utterances , with 405 related to prior knowledge activa - tion ( about 6 % of total talk and 12 % of instructional utterances ) . The data indicated that teacher prompting of students’ relevant knowledge and experiences in the cur - rent investigation manifested more frequently than previously observed ( Hattan et al . , 2015 ) . Yet , 6 % still represents a relatively small percentage of total teacher talk . Moreo - ver , as shown in Table 2 , the frequency of PK utterances was highly variable across teachers and lessons ( range 13 – 71 ) . Some teachers , such as Teacher A ( 3rd grade ) and Teacher E ( 5th grade ) , were found to activate prior knowledge to similar degrees across the two observed lessons . By contrast , the frequency of activation for other teachers , such as Teacher D ( 4th grade ) and Teacher F ( 5th grade ) , were vastly different for the two observed lessons . The most common categories of teacher utterances were managing tasks ( n = 2503 ; 39 % ) , information sharing ( n = 1267 ; 20 % ) , and evaluation / feedback ( n = 1258 ; 20 % ) . Additionally , 45 % of total teacher utterances focused on managing tasks or managing students , with the remaining 55 % pertaining to instruction . However , if students tend to automatically activate relevant prior knowledge without teacher prompting , then per - haps frequent or consistent teacher scaffolding would not be necessary . Therefore , we also investigated the frequency and nature of students’ responses to knowledge activa - tion prompts within this educational context . Student responses To explore students’ activation responses , we coded their utterances as elicited or unsolicited , relevant or irrelevant , and limited or extended . Table 3 provides the fre - quency and percentages of student utterances by class , category , and lesson . Of the 2563 student utterances across the 12 lessons , 447 utterances reflected prior knowl - edge activation , or 17 % of total student talk . There were 307 ( 69 % of prior knowl - edge utterances ) elicited prior knowledge activation utterances , and 140 ( 31 % ) unso - licited utterances , demonstrating that about one - third of student activation utterances 1631 1 3 Prior knowledge and its activation in elementary classroom… T a b l e 2 F r e qu e n c y a nd p e r ce n t a g e o f t eac h e r u tt e r a n ce s by t eac h e r , ca t e go r y a nd l e ss on C a t e go r y T eac h e r A ( 3 r d ) T eac h e r B ( 3 r d ) T eac h e r C ( 4 t h ) T eac h e r D ( 4 t h ) T eac h e r E ( 5 t h ) T eac h e r F ( 5 t h ) T o t a l f o r bo t h l e ss on s L e ss on f ( % ) f ( % ) f ( % ) f ( % ) f ( % ) f ( % ) f ( % ) P K ac ti v a ti on 1 32 ( 9 . 2 ) 20 ( 6 . 2 ) 16 ( 1 . 9 ) 20 ( 3 . 1 ) 34 ( 7 . 2 ) 58 ( 8 . 6 ) 405 ( 6 . 4 ) 2 39 ( 8 . 9 ) 31 ( 6 . 5 ) 40 ( 8 . 8 ) 71 ( 9 . 9 ) 31 ( 5 . 5 ) 13 ( 3 . 1 ) T e x t e xp li c it 1 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 2 ( 0 . 6 ) 1 ( 0 . 1 ) 11 ( 1 . 7 ) 16 ( 3 . 4 ) 24 ( 3 . 6 ) 87 ( 1 . 4 ) 2 1 ( 0 . 2 ) 8 ( 1 . 7 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 7 ( 1 . 0 ) 16 ( 2 . 9 ) 1 ( 0 . 2 ) T e x t i m p li c it 1 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 3 ( 0 . 9 ) 1 ( 0 . 1 ) 25 ( 3 . 9 ) 9 ( 1 . 9 ) 33 ( 4 . 9 ) 131 ( 2 . 1 ) 2 23 ( 5 . 2 ) 18 ( 3 . 8 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 5 ( 0 . 7 ) 14 ( 2 . 5 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) E v i d e n ce 1 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 7 ( 0 . 9 ) 32 ( 5 . 0 ) 9 ( 1 . 9 ) 20 ( 3 . 0 ) 115 ( 1 . 8 ) 2 20 ( 4 . 5 ) 2 ( 0 . 4 ) 18 ( 4 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 7 ( 1 . 2 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) U n s ub s t a n ti a t e d 1 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 2 ( 0 . 2 ) 40 ( 6 . 2 ) 19 ( 4 . 0 ) 45 ( 6 . 7 ) 179 ( 2 . 8 ) 2 4 ( 0 . 9 ) 2 ( 0 . 4 ) 11 ( 2 . 4 ) 19 ( 2 . 7 ) 35 ( 6 . 2 ) 2 ( 0 . 5 ) P r e d i c ti on 1 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 1 ( 0 . 2 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 25 ( 3 . 7 ) 31 ( 0 . 5 ) 2 1 ( 0 . 2 ) 3 ( 0 . 6 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 1 ( 0 . 2 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) T eac h e r f ee db ac k 1 57 ( 1 6 . 5 ) 49 ( 15 . 3 ) 203 ( 24 . 7 ) 116 ( 18 . 1 ) 130 ( 27 . 7 ) 138 ( 20 . 6 ) 1258 ( 19 . 8 ) 2 71 ( 1 6 . 1 ) 87 ( 18 . 2 ) 110 ( 24 . 2 ) 104 ( 14 . 5 ) 125 ( 22 . 2 ) 68 ( 16 . 3 ) I n f o r m a ti on s h a r i ng 1 51 ( 1 4 . 7 ) 149 ( 46 . 4 ) 43 ( 5 . 2 ) 133 ( 20 . 7 ) 78 ( 16 . 6 ) 88 ( 13 . 1 ) 1267 ( 20 . 0 ) 2 52 ( 1 1 . 8 ) 188 ( 39 . 3 ) 44 ( 10 . 0 ) 262 ( 37 . 0 ) 121 ( 21 . 5 ) 58 ( 13 . 9 ) 1632 C .

These data suggest that even relatively high - achieving , middle - class students are more likely to verbalize their knowledge activation when explicitly prompted to do so . However , we were also interested in whether the knowledge and experiences stu - dents shared were relevant or irrelevant to the lesson content , or limited or extended in form . We found that 412 ( 92 % ) of the prior knowledge activation utterances were relevant to the topic . An example of a relevant answer to the question “What does it mean to be an explorer ? ” was “It’s someone who travels like all around the world / trying to find a new area and different places . ” On the other hand , there were 35 ( 8 % ) irrelevant utterances , which were either off - topic or tangential .

Hattan , P . A . Alexander 1 3 during a conversation about the five senses , one student talked about the sense of touch , and described what a snake feels like . However , another student stated , “I don’t like snakes , ” which activated his or her prior knowledge about snakes , but did not add to the conversation about senses , and was therefore coded as irrelevant . Lim - ited responses , such as one or two - word answers , comprised 155 ( 34 % ) of the prior knowledge activation utterances . For example , in response to the prompt , “How fast is a cheetah ? ” a limited response was “Fast ! ” Alternatively , 292 ( 65 % ) utterances were part of an extended explanation . One example of an extended student utterance , in response to the prompt , “What is indigenous ? ” was “It’s like originating or living from a place . ” These data suggest that students tended to share relevant information that was also elaborated in form . Rather than assuming that students’ knowledge and experiences will be extraneous , teachers should consider ways to bring forth stu - dents’ prior knowledge and link it directly to the text content . Nature of prior knowledge activation To investigate the nature of the prior knowledge activation utterances , we coded each teacher and student utterance according to referential frame and when during text processing knowledge activation occurred . Additionally , teacher utterances were also coded according to their intended purpose . Referential frames Table 4 presents the frequency and percentage of teacher and student PKA utter - ances in total and by referential frame ( i . e . , previous lesson , general world knowl - edge , specific text , or personal experiences ) . Teachers most frequently prompted students to refer back to a previous lesson , with 159 utterances representing 39 . 3 % of total teacher PKA utterances . Although students referenced previous lessons in 94 utterances ( 21 . 0 % ) , their responses were more often about general world knowl - edge and specific texts . Teachers prompted students’ general world knowledge 133 times ( 32 . 8 % of total PKA utterances ) , while students responded in kind 146 times ( 32 . 7 % ) . Somewhat surprisingly , although there were only 69 teacher utterances that referred to a specific text ( 17 . 0 % ) , 139 student utterances ( 31 . 1 % ) fell in this cat - egory , but those occurrences took place in only six of the twelve lessons . Teachers asked students about their personal experiences 44 times ( 10 . 9 % ) across eight of the twelve lessons , while students responded with reference to personal experiences 68 times ( 15 . 2 % ) across seven of the twelve lessons . Perhaps not surprising , when teachers used a particular referential frame to acti - vate students prior knowledge , students routinely responded to that specific request . However , there was one instance when there was a mismatch between the teacher’s prompt and the student’s response . On that occasion , the teacher elicited students’ general world knowledge ( “So if he’s a treasurer , what’s his job ? ” ) , while the student responded based on personal experience ( “I know this because at my church my dad is one of the treasurers” ) . 1635 1 3 Prior knowledge and its activation in elementary classroom… T a b l e 4 T eac h e r a nd s t ud e n t u tt e r a n ce s by r e f e r e n ti a l fr a m e C a t e go r y ( 3 r d ) ( 4 t h ) ( 5 t h ) T o t a l f o r bo t h l e ss on s f ( % ) f ( % ) f ( % ) f ( % ) L e ss on T A S s T B S s T C S s T D S s TE S s T F S s T s S s P r e v i ou s l e ss on 1 26 ( 81 . 3 ) 20 ( 95 . 2 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 1 ( 2 . 4 ) 15 ( 93 . 8 ) 4 ( 100 . 0 ) 4 ( 20 . 0 ) 1 ( 2 . 5 ) 13 ( 38 . 2 ) 7 ( 12 . 7 ) 32 ( 55 . 2 ) 29 ( 5 9 . 2 ) 159 ( 39 . 3 ) 94 ( 21 . 0 ) 2 26 ( 66 . 7 ) 19 ( 55 . 9 ) 9 ( 29 . 0 ) 1 ( 3 . 4 ) 2 ( 5 . 0 ) 1 ( 1 . 2 ) 18 ( 25 . 4 ) 7 ( 14 . 0 ) 10 ( 32 . 3 ) 4 ( 12 . 5 ) 4 ( 30 . 8 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) G e n e r a l w o r l d kno w l e dg e 1 6 ( 18 . 8 ) 1 ( 4 . 8 ) 7 ( 35 . 0 ) 8 ( 19 . 0 ) 1 ( 6 . 3 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 7 ( 35 . 0 ) 15 ( 37 . 5 ) 13 ( 38 . 2 ) 31 ( 56 . 4 ) 22 ( 37 . 9 ) 19 ( 3 8 . 8 ) 133 ( 32 . 8 ) 146 ( 32 . 7 ) 2 7 ( 17 . 9 ) 12 ( 35 . 3 ) 6 ( 19 . 4 ) 6 ( 20 . 7 ) 2 ( 5 . 0 ) 3 ( 3 . 5 ) 41 ( 57 . 7 ) 35 ( 70 . 0 ) 12 ( 38 . 7 ) 10 ( 32 . 3 ) 9 ( 69 . 2 ) 6 ( 100 . 0 ) S p ec i fi c t e x t 1 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 5 ( 25 . 0 ) 13 ( 32 . 5 ) 1 ( 2 . 9 ) 7 ( 12 . 7 ) 2 ( 3 . 4 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 69 ( 17 . 0 ) 139 ( 31 . 1 ) 2 3 ( 7 . 7 ) 2 ( 5 . 9 ) 14 ( 45 . 2 ) 18 ( 62 . 1 ) 36 ( 90 . 0 ) 81 ( 95 . 3 ) 2 ( 2 . 8 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 6 ( 19 . 4 ) 18 ( 56 . 3 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) P e r s on a l e xp e r i e n ce s 1 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 13 ( 65 . 0 ) 33 ( 78 . 6 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 4 ( 20 . 0 ) 11 ( 27 . 5 ) 7 ( 20 . 6 ) 10 ( 18 . 2 ) 2 ( 3 . 4 ) 1 ( 2 . 0 ) 44 ( 10 . 9 ) 68 ( 15 . 2 ) 2 3 ( 7 . 7 ) 1 ( 2 . 9 ) 2 ( 6 . 5 ) 4 ( 13 . 8 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 10 ( 14 . 1 ) 8 ( 16 . 0 ) 3 ( 9 . 7 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) T o t a l 71 55 51 71 56 89 91 90 65 87 71 55 405 447 1636 C . Hattan , P . A . Alexander 1 3 Considering that students typically responded according to the prompted referen - tial frame , we chose to examine students’ unsolicited PK utterances separately ( see Table 5 ) . Students most frequently offered unsolicited information that referenced a specific text they had read ( 64 utterances ; 45 . 7 % of total ) . However , more than half those spontaneous specific text events ( n = 38 ) occurred in a single lesson taught by Teacher C . In reexamining this lesson , this anomalous utterance pattern seemed tied to the fact that the students had just finished reading an historical fiction text about Benjamin Banneker . Also , the lesson included several activities meant to summa - rize students’ learning at the end of the unit . Therefore , it makes sense that students in this particular lesson would frequently refer back to the specific text that they recently finished reading . Nonetheless , it should be noted that students’ unprompted referencing of a specific text occurred in five out of the twelve lessons observed . The second most common referential frame for unsolicited prior knowledge activation was general world knowledge , ( n = 38 ; 27 . 1 % of total ) , followed by personal experi - ences ( n = 26 ; 18 . 6 % ) and previous lessons ( n = 12 ; 10 . 0 % ) ( Table 5 ) . Before , during , and after reading Most of the PKA utterances occurred before reading , with 176 teacher utterances ( 43 . 5 % of total teacher PKA utterances ) , and 191 student utterances ( 42 . 7 % of total student PKA utterances ) ( Table 6 ) . In contrast to a prior investigation ( Hattan et al . , 2015 ) , after - reading utterances accounted for 124 teacher utterances ( 30 . 6 % of total ) and 173 ( 38 . 7 % ) of student utterances . However , this deviation from prior findings Table 5 Unsolicited student utterances by referential frame Category Class A ( 3rd ) Class B ( 3rd ) Class C ( 4th ) Class D ( 4th ) Class E ( 5th ) Class F ( 5th ) Total Lesson f ( % ) f ( % ) f ( % ) f ( % ) f ( % ) f ( % ) f ( % ) Previous lesson 1 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 1 ( 100 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 4 ( 13 . 3 ) 5 ( 71 . 4 ) 12 ( 10 . 0 ) 2 2 ( 22 . 2 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) General world knowledge 1 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 7 ( 29 . 2 ) 12 ( 40 . 0 ) 2 ( 28 . 6 ) 38 ( 27 . 1 ) 2 6 ( 66 . 7 ) 3 ( 37 . 5 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 6 ( 54 . 5 ) 2 ( 16 . 7 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Specific text 1 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 7 ( 29 . 2 ) 7 ( 23 . 3 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 64 ( 45 . 7 ) 2 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 2 ( 25 . 0 ) 38 ( 100 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 10 ( 83 . 3 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Personal experiences 1 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 10 ( 41 . 7 ) 7 ( 23 . 3 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 26 ( 18 . 6 ) 2 1 ( 11 . 1 ) 3 ( 37 . 5 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 5 ( 45 . 5 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) Total 1 0 1 0 24 30 7 2 9 8 38 11 12 0 Com - bined 9 9 38 35 42 7 140 1637 1 3 Prior knowledge and its activation in elementary classroom… T a b l e 6 T eac h e r a nd s t ud e n t u tt e r a n ce s b e f o r e , du r i ng , a nd a f t e r r ea d i ng C a t e go r y ( 3 r d ) ( 4 t h ) ( 5 t h ) T o t a l f o r bo t h l e ss on s f ( % ) f ( % ) f ( % ) f ( % ) L e ss on T A S s T B S s T C S s T D S s TE S s T F S s T s S s B e f o r e 1 31 ( 96 . 8 ) 21 ( 100 . 0 ) 15 ( 75 . 0 ) 36 ( 85 . 7 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 6 ( 30 . 0 ) 10 ( 25 . 0 ) 33 ( 97 . 1 ) 55 ( 100 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 176 ( 43 . 5 ) 191 ( 42 . 7 ) 2 8 ( 20 . 5 ) 6 ( 17 . 6 ) 12 ( 38 . 7 ) 13 ( 44 . 8 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 71 ( 100 . 0 ) 50 ( 100 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) D u r i ng 1 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 5 ( 25 . 0 ) 5 ( 11 . 9 ) 16 ( 100 . 0 ) 4 ( 100 . 0 ) 11 ( 55 . 0 ) 30 ( 75 . 0 ) 1 ( 2 . 9 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 105 ( 25 . 9 ) 83 ( 18 . 6 ) 2 31 ( 79 . 5 ) 28 ( 82 . 4 ) 10 ( 32 . 3 ) 16 ( 55 . 2 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 31 ( 100 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) A f t e r 1 1 ( 3 . 1 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 1 ( 2 . 4 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 3 ( 15 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 58 ( 100 . 0 ) 49 ( 100 . 0 ) 124 ( 30 . 6 ) 173 ( 38 . 7 ) 2 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 9 ( 29 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 40 ( 100 . 0 ) 85 ( 100 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 32 ( 100 . 0 ) 13 ( 100 . 0 ) 6 ( 100 . 0 ) T o t a l 1 32 21 20 42 16 4 20 40 34 55 58 49 2 39 34 31 29 40 85 71 50 31 32 13 6 C o m - b i n e d 71 55 51 71 56 89 91 90 65 87 71 55 405 447 1638 C . Hattan , P . A . Alexander 1 3 likely reflects that several of the observed lessons took place after students had com - pleted the reading of the assigned text either as homework on the previous night or during the previous class period . As noted , only five of the twelve lessons included before , during , and after reading components . Purpose for prior knowledge activation prompts As indicated in the data in Table 7 , teachers’ primary purpose in activating students’ knowledge was apparently to assess their familiarity or knowledge of the content ( n = 181 ; 44 . 7 % of total teacher PKA utterances ) . The second most documented purpose was to remind students of something they already learned ( n = 78 ; 19 . 3 % ) , followed by motivating students or providing relevance ( n = 59 , 14 . 6 % ) , generating inferences ( n = 53 ; 13 . 1 % ) , and clarifying ambiguities ( n = 33 ; 8 . 1 % ) . Activation routines When our focus shifted to a more macro - level view of discourse , several routines related to the activation of students’ knowledge and experiences were identified ( Fig . 2a – d ) . The first of these , the nonresponsive routine ( 2a ) , occurred when a teacher asked a question or made a statement , but students did not respond . This routine may have resulted because teachers were operating or were presumed to be operating rhetorically by making a rather oblique reference to prior instruction . For example , one teacher voiced the following prompts in rapid succession : “Remem - ber when we talked about Hitler the other day ? About him persecuting Jews . ” This teacher’s lack of a pause after each prompt may have signaled to the students that she was not seeking any explicit response or even confirmation from them . A nonresponsive routine might also occur because the teacher answered the ques - tions herself . For example , a teacher asked , “What does brackish mean ? ” She then immediately responded that , “Brackish means the water is not totally clean . ” Thus , as in the previous example , it was apparent that this teacher did not intend students to verbally react to the question posed . Further , it was unclear whether either teacher even expected her students to reflect on the questions in that moment . A second teacher - instigated routine , question – answer ( 2b ) , unfolded when the teacher ( T ) asked a question and only one student ( S ) responded . Question – answer routines frequently occurred without further feedback or any follow - up response from the teacher . For example , during the reading of a text on Christopher Colum - bus , the following teacher - student exchanges were recorded : T : Did the natives know Columbus’ language or dialect ? S : No And again , T : Now , what kind of geographical landform are they on ? S : An island . 1639 1 3 Prior knowledge and its activation in elementary classroom… T a b l e 7 T eac h e r u tt e r a n ce s by pu r po s e P u r po s e T eac h e r A ( 3 r d ) T eac h e r B ( 3 r d ) T eac h e r C ( 4 t h ) T eac h e r D ( 4 t h ) T eac h e r E ( 5 t h ) T eac h e r F ( 5 t h ) T o t a l f o r bo t h l e ss on s L e ss on f ( % ) f ( % ) f ( % ) f ( % ) f ( % ) f ( % ) f ( % ) R e m i nd 1 6 ( 18 . 8 ) 1 ( 5 . 0 ) 6 ( 37 . 5 ) 3 ( 15 . 0 ) 9 ( 26 . 5 ) 9 ( 15 . 5 ) 78 ( 19 . 3 ) 2 7 ( 17 . 9 ) 9 ( 29 . 0 ) 9 ( 22 . 5 ) 12 ( 16 . 9 ) 5 ( 16 . 1 ) 2 ( 15 . 4 ) A ss e ss 1 20 ( 6 2 . 5 ) 2 ( 10 . 0 ) 1 0 ( 62 . 5 ) 5 ( 25 . 0 ) 10 ( 2 . 9 ) 32 ( 55 . 2 ) 181 ( 44 . 7 ) 2 16 ( 4 1 . 0 ) 8 ( 25 . 8 ) 2 1 ( 52 . 5 ) 28 ( 11 . 3 ) 22 ( 71 . 0 ) 7 ( 53 . 8 ) C l a r i f y a m b i gu iti e s 1 2 ( 6 . 3 ) 1 ( 5 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 1 ( 5 . 0 ) 4 ( 11 . 8 ) 8 ( 13 . 8 ) 33 ( 8 . 1 ) 2 4 ( 10 . 3 ) 3 ( 9 . 7 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 6 ( 8 . 5 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 4 ( 53 . 8 ) M o ti v a t e / r e l e v a n ce 1 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 14 ( 7 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 4 ( 20 . 0 ) 7 ( 20 . 6 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 59 ( 14 . 6 ) 2 6 ( 15 . 4 ) 6 ( 19 . 4 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 18 ( 25 . 4 ) 4 ( 12 . 9 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) G e n e r a t e i n f e r e n ce s 1 4 ( 12 . 5 ) 2 ( 10 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 6 ( 30 . 0 ) 4 ( 11 . 8 ) 9 ( 15 . 5 ) 53 ( 13 . 1 ) 2 6 ( 15 . 4 ) 5 ( 16 . 1 ) 1 0 ( 25 . 0 ) 7 ( 9 . 9 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) 0 ( 0 . 0 ) T o t a l 1 32 20 1 6 20 34 58 405 2 39 31 4 0 71 31 13 1640 C . Hattan , P . A . Alexander 1 3 A third routine , simple feedback ( 2c ) , was identified when a teacher asked a question , a student answered , and the teacher simply affirmed or acknowledged Fig . 2 Prior knowledge activation routines including a nonresponsive ; b question – answer ; c simple feed - back ; and , d interaction routines ( a ) Nonresponsive … ( b ) Question - Answer ( c ) Simple Feedback ( d ) Interaction Teacher Teacher Student Teacher Student Teacher Teacher Student 1 Student 2 Student 3 1641 1 3 Prior knowledge and its activation in elementary classroom… the response and then moved on . The simple feedback category may have included a positive acknowledgment ( e . g . , “yes” or “good point” ) , a negative acknowledgment ( e . g . , “no , ” or “not quite” ) or a neutral response , such as restat - ing what the student said . For example : T : You’ve probably seen the Disney movie ! Yes ? S : Pocahontas ! T : Yes ! This routine most closely approximates the Initiate - Response - Evaluate ( IRE ) pattern well documented in the classroom discourse literature ( Cazden & Beck , 2003 ; Mehan , 1979 ) . The unresponsive , question – answer , and simple feedback routines tended to occur at the beginning of instruction , either before reading a new text or while reviewing the previous day’s lesson . The final discourse routine was the interaction pattern ( 2d ) . This routine was identified when the teacher elaborated on students’ answers , or aided students in understanding the connections between different students’ responses . In the inter - action routine , multiple students were frequently engaged ; student misunderstand - ings were addressed ; or an extension of the espoused ideas proffered by teacher or other students were discussed . This more elaborated pattern is exemplified in the following interaction : T : We talked the other day briefly about… You guys were nervous about and worried about an outbreak of which disease in the world ? Students : Ebola ! T : Ebola , we talked about , that there’s an outbreak where ? Not in the United States . Where , where ? Student 1 [ Name called ] ? S1 : The Middle East ? T : No , not quite S1 : Aww T : Uh , that region of the country , I mean that region of the world , but not there . Uh , Student 2 [ Name called ] ? S2 : A city in Africa T : Yeah it’s actually some western African nations and they’re doing a very good job of containing it to a few places . So there may be an epidemic , but it’s not a worldwide epidemic , it’s an epidemic in Western Africa . So , and as we talked about in the US we have good medical care , and they the cases that started here have been resolved and they stopped the epidemic . So what other kinds of epidemics can we have ? And we get epidemics in this school . What kind of epidemics ? S3 : Like the flu The interaction routine often included unsolicited knowledge activation , or con - versations between students without a teacher utterance between each student utterance . Moreover , although the interaction routine was occasionally utilized at the beginning of a lesson , it more commonly came up in during or after read - ing conversations , providing for authentic conversations that connected stu - dents’ knowledge to the text throughout the reading process . This routine was 1642 C . Hattan , P . A . Alexander 1 3 particularly common for the teachers whose lessons focused on either before - reading or after - reading activities . Overall , these data indicated that , across all teachers , the most common prior knowledge activation routines were question – answer and simple feedback , as previ - ously found in studies of general teacher questioning ( e . g . , Mehan , 1979 ) . The least common routine was the interaction routine . However , given that the interaction routine required multiple teacher and student utterances , it made up a high percent - age of total utterances . Additionally , some of the more student - directed discourse patterns identified in the literature ( Fuchs et al . , 1997 ; Perret - Clermont et al . , 1991 ) were not identified in these data . However , this could be due to the episodes of class - room discourse audiotaped for this investigation , since small group and individual worktimes were not included in the final transcripts used for analysis . As expected , there were differences among teachers and lessons . The two 3rd - grade teachers had less variety in their routines , focusing mainly on the simple feedback approach . At the same time , one 5th - grade teacher included a high fre - quency of interaction routines in her first lesson , but fewer in her second lesson . This discrepancy may be attributed to the different purposes or goals for the two lessons . During the first lesson , students read a text on the initial encounter between Columbus and indigenous people . The lesson included a rich discussion regarding different points of view , as well as resources available to each of the two groups of people . The nature of the reading and discussion provided ample opportunities for prior knowledge activation , and included both limited and extended responses from students . The second lesson continued to focus on Columbus , but instead of honing in on perspectives or resources , the students were asked to use adjectives to describe different artifacts . The observed lesson occurred after reading , when students broke up into small groups and came up with adjectives that described artifacts Columbus may have had during his journey to the Americas . There were fewer total utterances that occurred during the whole - class discussion of the artifacts , and fewer opportu - nities for students to make connections to their prior knowledge . Conclusions , implications , and limitations Prior knowledge activation is central to the process of learning and text comprehen - sion ( e . g . , Anderson & Pearson , 2002 ; Kintsch , 1998 ) , and therefore it is impor - tant to gain a better understanding of the frequency with which teachers elicit stu - dents’ knowledge activation as well as the frequency with which students share their knowledge and experiences during language arts and social studies lessons . At present , there are no guidelines for how frequently or in what way teachers should prompt students to share their knowledge or experiences during literacy instruction . Nonetheless , if students are to comprehend and remember what they read , then the connection between students’ existing knowledge and the content of texts must be forged . For many students , this connection can be facilitated by teachers’ prompting ; that is , by prior knowledge activation . 1643 1 3 Prior knowledge and its activation in elementary classroom… The current study affords an interesting contrast to an earlier investigation ( i . e . , middle - income private school versus low - income public school ; curricular free - dom versus specified curriculum ) . Teachers in the current study activated students’ prior knowledge more frequently than found in a previous study where only 1 . 5 % of teacher talk guided students to share their knowledge and experiences ( Hattan et al . , 2015 ) . However , in both the current study and the prior research , teachers most fre - quently prompted students to call to mind information from previous lessons , con - sider any relevant general world knowledge they may have , and think about some specific text they had read . In the current study , teachers infrequently prompted stu - dents to consider any pertinent personal experiences , which is similar to our prior investigation ( Hattan et al . , 2015 ) where we documented no instances of this par - ticular referential frame . Additionally , the results from the current study demonstrate that students are more likely to share their knowledge and experiences when prompted to do so , and that the referential frames they utilize almost perfectly matched that of their teacher . Therefore , teachers should not neglect this important instructional routine during literacy lessons . Additionally , distinguishing between explicit versus unsolicited activation , relevant versus irrelevant , and limited versus extended , provides educa - tors and researchers with a deeper understanding of what prior knowledge activation looks like within language arts and social studies classroom discourse . Specifically , it is interesting that , although prior knowledge activation only accounted for 6 % of total teacher talk across the 12 episodes of classroom discourse , either elicited or unsolicited knowledge activation accounted for 21 % of total student talk . This is likely due to the fact that a large percentage of teacher talk focused on managing tasks , sharing content , or providing feedback for students . Moreover , students pro - vided more relevant ( 16 % ) than irrelevant ( 1 . 4 % ) prior knowledge activation utter - ances . This is consistent with Kintsch’s ( 1998 ) theory that readers seek to strengthen connections between relevant knowledge and the text while setting aside activated knowledge that appear irrelevant to the context . This process of knowledge activa - tion allows new information to assimilate into readers’ existing knowledge base , potentially transforming what the reader knows or understands about the text topic . The patterns of prior knowledge activation provide additional insight into the ways in which teachers guide students’ activation . Although the most common rou - tines were question – answer and simple feedback at the beginning of a lesson , fur - ther teacher probing could help produce relevant connections that assist students in understanding the text or content . However , these connections were often dependent on the classroom climate , with the interaction routines occurring most frequently in more engaged classroom environments . Specifically , interaction routines were more common during rich , text - based discussions during the middle of a lesson or during lessons that did not include before , during , and after reading components , but less common when students were working on worksheets or reading short , descriptive paragraphs rather than novels . This examination of classroom discourse between teachers and students indicates that the talk that does occur is not necessarily scaf - folding in nature or supportive of new learning . Additionally , and perhaps due to the constraints under which this research was conducted , student - directed activation patterns were not documented . 1644 C . Hattan , P . A . Alexander 1 3 Specifically , in this study , teachers retained responsibility for initiating the epi - sodes of prior knowledge activation . These patterns demonstrate that not only the frequency of prior knowledge activation , but also the routines and quality of that activation seem of marked importance ( Murphy , Wilkinson , Soter , Hennessey , & Alexander , 2009 ) . Teachers can assist students in both building and activating their knowledge , relying on both of these teaching techniques to help students develop an understanding of the text . However , the current study was not without its limitations . From a theoretical standpoint , the research on prior knowledge , including this study , is hampered by any guidance on how often , for what particular reason , and in what specific way students’ relevant knowledge and their pertinent life experiences should be interjected into the classroom discourse . Moreover , our decision to conduct a study within the flow of regular classroom instruction meant that we could not orchestrate the conditions that would allow for an experimental investigation of prior knowledge activation effects on comprehension . Among those conditions were the lesson content and the administration of any pretest or posttest meas - ures of background knowledge or comprehension . Therefore , it is unclear as to whether instances of prior knowledge activation helped students make inferences ( Kintsch , 2000 ) , remember text content ( Pressley et al . , 1989 ) , or understand the significance of what was read ( Alexander , 1999 ) . We recognize that despite the interesting patterns identified in the classroom - based investigation , the analyses we conducted do not permit us to draw any causal conclusions . In future inves - tigations , it would be beneficial to experimentally investigate whether there was any association between teachers’ explicit prompting of students’ background knowledge and experiences and students’ comprehension performance . Such an experimental test would require more regulation of lesson content , instructional format ( e . g . , whole class or small group ) , and activation procedures instantiated . Additionally , in the current investigation , we were not permitted access to stu - dents’ performance data beyond teacher ratings of below - , on - , and above - grade level reading ability . In light of the rich literature on the interplay of individual and group differences and comprehension performance , subsequent studies of prior knowledge activation should consider a range of potentially influential fac - tors such as reading ability , topic interest and reading interest , as well as gender and ethnicity . Given current trends in American education policy , it is important that the pro - cess of supporting students in activating their knowledge not be brushed aside . In fact , Pearson and Cervetti ( 2015 ) convincingly argued that the process of reading should not only include text - dependent tasks , but should also integrate prior knowl - edge with new knowledge , using what you know to engage in a close reading of the given texts . This view is consistent with theories and empirical research on reading comprehension , supporting the crucial role of prior knowledge to reading and learn - ing ( e . g . , Ausubel , 1968 ; Kintsch , 1998 ; Peeck et al . , 1982 ) . In effect , researchers and educators should continue to investigate the ways in which teachers can support 1645 1 3 Prior knowledge and its activation in elementary classroom… the activation of students’ prior knowledge within classroom settings , so that teach - ers promote deeper comprehension and higher - level learning from text .
