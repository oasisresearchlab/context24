We conducted a genome - wide scan among 277 TGCT cases and 919 controls and found that seven markers at 12p22 within KITLG ( c - KIT ligand ) reached genome - wide signiﬁcance ( P o 5 . 0 (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) 8 in discovery ) . In independent replication , TGCT risk was increased threefold per copy of the major allele at rs3782179 and rs4474514 ( OR ¼ 3 . 08 , 95 % CI ¼ 2 . 29 – 4 . 13 ; OR ¼ 3 . 07 , 95 % CI ¼ 2 . 29 – 4 . 13 , respectively ) . We found associations with rs4324715 and rs6897876 at 5q31 . 3 near SPRY4 ( sprouty 4 ; P o 5 . 0 (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) 6 in discovery ) . In independent replication , risk of TGCT was increased nearly 40 % per copy of the major allele ( OR ¼ 1 . 37 , 95 % CI ¼ 1 . 14 – 1 . 64 ; OR ¼ 1 . 39 , 95 % CI ¼ 1 . 16 – 1 . 66 , respectively ) . All of the genotypes were associated with both seminoma and nonseminoma TGCT subtypes . These results demonstrate that common genetic variants affect TGCT risk and implicate KITLG and SPRY4 as genes involved in TGCT susceptibility . In the United States , testicular germ cell tumors ( TGCT ) are the most common cancers in young men , with a peak incidence among those aged 25 to 34 years 1 . The age - adjusted incidence in white men has doubled since 1975 and is now 6 . 6 per 100 , 000 . The incidence in white non - Hispanic men is nearly ﬁvefold higher than among black men 1 . The reasons for the increasing incidence and racial disparity in TGCT rates are unknown . Although environmental exposures have been postulated to have a role in the increasing incidence of TGCT , there also is evidence for a substantial genetic contribution to TGCT susceptibility . Brothers of individuals with TGCT have an 8 - to 12 - fold increased risk of disease , with the risk to monozygotic and dizygotic twins 75 - and 35 - fold increased , respectively , and fathers of affected individuals have a fourfold increased risk 2 , 3 . Consistent with the high familial risks compared to most other cancer types and the ancestry - related differences in TGCT risk , the proportion of TGCT susceptibility accounted for by genetic effects is estimated at 25 % , and TGCT has the third highest heritability among all cancers 4 . Results from linkage studies and candidate gene approaches , how - ever , have produced limited insight into TGCT susceptibility factors . An initial report of linkage on Xq27 was not replicated nor have other loci been identiﬁed with signiﬁcant effects , which suggests that multi - ple loci , potentially of weak to moderate effect , contribute to disease susceptibility 5 , 6 . The gr / gr deletion on the Y chromosome , studied as a candidate region , increases TGCT risk two - to threefold , but carriage frequency of this variant is low ( 2 – 3 % ) , suggesting that it likely accounts for only a small component of risk 7 . Thus , despite the multiple lines of evidence suggesting a genetic etiology of TGCT , no genetic risk factor has been identiﬁed that can explain an appreciable proportion of TGCT cases . To identify genes associated with TGCT development , we con - ducted a genome - wide association study . Cases were 277 white , non - Hispanic men with pathologically deﬁned TGCT seen at the University of Pennsylvania Health System ( UPHS ) or Fox Chase Cancer Center ( FCCC ) in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . We genotyped DNA extracted from venous blood using the Affymetrix Genome - Wide Human SNP Array 6 . 0 . We compared the frequency of observed genotypes among TGCT cases to those available from 919 white , non - Hispanic males from the Philadelphia region genotyped on the same Affymetrix platform ( Table 1 ) .

The calculated genomic control inﬂation ( l ) factor was 0 . 944 , and hence we report unadjusted test statistics 9 . Eight markers reached statistical signiﬁcance at a genome - wide threshold of P o 5 . 0 (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) 8 ( Fig . 1 and Supplementary Table 1 online ) . Seven of these ( rs995030 , rs1352947 , rs1472899 , rs3782179 , rs3782181 , rs4474514 , rs11104952 ) , including the most signiﬁcant association ( P ¼ 3 . 54 (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) 10 ) at rs4474514 , occurred within the KITLG ( c - KIT ligand ) gene region on 12q22 ( Supplementary Fig . 2 online ) . These markers were in strong linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) with each other ; pairwise D and r 2 measures were all 4 0 . 99 ( Fig . 2a ) . The eighth marker ( rs3770112 , P ¼ 4 . 93 (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) 8 ) mapped to the integrin alpha 4 ( ITGA4 ) gene on 2q31 . 3 . Because no other markers in this genomic region ( ±10 Mb ) reached statistical signiﬁcance at P o 1 . 0 (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) 3 , we suspected that this association might have arisen purely by chance . We further investigated this possibility by imputing genotypes near rs3770112 on the basis of publicly available HapMap genotypic data 10 . After imputation , the test of association at rs3770112 no longer surpassed the genome - wide threshold ( P ¼ 0 . 05 ) ; as well , all other markers in the region remained below the threshold for advanc - ing to replication . The correlation between observed and imputed P values for the 23 markers that were in the same LD block with rs3770112 was very high ( r ¼ 0 . 96 ) , and information content and maximum posterior call probability for rs3770112 were both 4 0 . 998 . Taken together , these results strongly suggested that the association observed in the discovery phase was a false positive ( Supplementary Fig . 3a , b online ) . We selected two markers in KITLG ( rs3782179 , rs4474514 ) to bring forward into replication . Sixteen additional markers reached statistical signiﬁcance at the P o 5 . 0 (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) 6 level ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Of these , three ( rs12521013 , rs4324715 , rs6897876 ) mapped 2 . 4 kb downstream of the SPRY4 ( sprouty homolog 4 ) coding region on 5q31 . 3 ( Fig . 2b and Supplementary Fig . 4 online ) , and two ( rs17031166 , rs1549383 ) mapped to a gene - free region on 2p14 that is 500 kb centromeric of SPRED2 ( sprouty - related , EVH1 domain containing 2 ) ( Supplemen - tary Fig . 3a ) . As both SPRY4 and SPRED2 have been implicated in the KIT – KITLG signaling pathway 11 , 12 , and as these two regions were the only ones that contained more than one marker surpassing threshold signiﬁcance , we also chose two markers at each of these loci ( SPRY4 : rs4324715 , rs6897876 ; 2p14 : rs17031166 , rs1549383 ) to bring forward for replication . The replication set consisted of a population - based set of 371 TGCT cases and 860 controls , all white non - Hispanic , recruited from residents of the metropolitan Seattle - Puget Sound region , and parents of 204 of the cases . We observed associations with rs3782179 ( P trend ¼ 5 . 88 (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) 15 ) and rs4474514 ( P trend ¼ 5 . 88 (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) 15 ) in KITLG and with rs4324715 ( P trend ¼ 6 . 77 (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) 4 ) and rs6897876 ( P trend ¼ 3 . 67 (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) 4 ) proximal to SPRY4 ( Table 2 ) , but not with rs17031166 ( P trend ¼ 0 . 90 ) or rs1549383 ( P trend ¼ 0 . 88 ) near SPRED2 . TGCT risk was increased threefold per copy of the major A allele in KITLG rs3782179 and rs4474514 ( OR ¼ 3 . 08 , 95 % CI ¼ 2 . 29 – 4 . 13 ; and OR ¼ 3 . 07 , 95 % CI ¼ 2 . 29 – 4 . 13 , respectively ) . Homozygous carriage of the major A allele at these loci was associated with an over fourfold increased risk of TGCT ( OR ¼ 4 . 56 , 95 % CI ¼ 1 . 78 – 11 . 7 ; and OR ¼ 4 . 56 , 95 % CI ¼ 1 . 77 – 11 . 7 , respectively ) compared with homozygous carriage of the Table 1 Age , family history of TGCT and tumor type in the discovery and replication samples Discovery Replication Status Case Control Case Control N ¼ 277 N ¼ 919 N ¼ 371 N ¼ 860 Total No . % No .

TGCT risk was increased nearly 40 % per copy of the major T allele in rs4324715 ( OR ¼ 1 . 37 , 95 % CI ¼ 1 . 14 – 1 . 64 ) and major C allele in rs6897876 ( OR ¼ 1 . 39 , 95 % CI ¼ 1 . 16 – 1 . 66 ) ; and risk was increased 65 – 80 % with homozygous carriage of the major alleles ( OR ¼ 1 . 81 , 95 % CI ¼ 1 . 26 – 2 . 58 ; and OR ¼ 1 . 68 , 95 % CI ¼ 1 . 17 – 2 . 42 , respectively ) compared with homozygous carriage of their corresponding minor alleles . In addition to the case - control analysis , we conducted a case - parent triad analysis , which also showed that carriage of the risk allele for the markers in KITLG and proximal to SPRY4 is associated with TGCT . The per - allele relative risks ( RR ) for rs3782179 and rs4474514 ( KITLG ) were 2 . 5 ( 95 % CI ¼ 1 . 6 – 0 . 9 ) and 2 . 6 ( 95 % CI ¼ 1 . 6 – 4 . 0 ) , respectively , and for rs4324715 and rs6897876 ( proximal to SPRY4 ) 1 . 5 ( 95 % CI 1 . 2 , 2 . 1 ) and 1 . 5 ( 95 % CI 1 . 1 , 2 . 0 ) , respectively . These family - based estimates provide additional evidence that popula - tion stratiﬁcation did not bias results in the replication phase . We did not observe an interaction between KITLG and SPRY4 marker genotypes . In the replication set , marker genotypes in KITLG and SPRY4 were associated with both semi - noma and nonseminoma germ cell tumors without indication that genotype associations differed between the two subtypes ( Table 3 ) . In subgroup analyses among those without a family history of TGCT and among those without cryptorchidism , two strong and well - established risk factors for TGCT , the genotypic ORs associated with KITLG and SPRY4 markers were only negligibly attenu - ated ( data not shown ) . These ﬁndings indi - cate that for most cases , KITLG and SPRY4 do not exert their effect solely through mecha - nisms involving these known risk factors . Because of limited numbers , it was not pos - sible to examine the effect of KITLG and SPRY4 among those with positive family history or personal history of cryptorchidism . We have identiﬁed variation at 12q22 as a major risk locus for TGCT susceptibility . For rs3782179 and rs4474514 , we observed a threefold increased risk of disease per major allele and a 4 . 5 - fold increased risk of disease for homozygous carriage of the major allele . The identiﬁed region contains KITLG , also known as stem cell factor , encoding the ligand for the receptor tyrosine kinase , c - KIT . The KITLG – KIT signaling pathway has an important role in gametogenesis , hematopoesis and melanogenesis 13 . In mouse models , Kitl ( encoded at the steel ( Sl ) locus ) is required for multiple aspects of primordial germ cell ( PGC ) development , including proliferation , migration and survival 14 , 15 . Kitl has a crucial role in the migration of PGCs from the hindgut and subsequent targeting to the genital ridges , and downregulation of Kitl in the midline triggers localized apoptosis of PGCs 15 . Given the similarity in cellular ultrastructure , patterns of imprinting and gene expression , multiple human studies have suggested that TGCTarises from PGCs 16 . Delayed differentiation of PGCs has been associated with development of testicular germ cell carcinoma in situ among individuals with intersex conditions and 10 a b Chromosome 12q22 Chromosome 5q31 . 3 – l og 10 ( P v a l ue ) – l og 10 ( P v a l ue ) 8 6 4 2 87 . 0 C12orf29CEP298 TNTC3 KITLG NDFIP1 SPRY4 87 . 2 87 . 4 Position ( Mb ) Position ( Mb ) 87 . 6 87 . 8 141 . 50 141 . 55 141 . 60 141 . 65 141 . 70 141 . 75 141 . 80 0 10 8 6 4 2 0 Figure 2 Regional association plots and linkage disequilibrium structure .

These data support a role for KITLG in TGCT susceptibility . Furthermore , loss of the transmembrane form of Kitl , which leads to decreased PGC number , has been identiﬁed as a TGCT suscept - ibility locus in the 129 / Sv mouse 18 . In humans , activating mutations of KIT are the most common somatic point mutations in TGCT , present in 25 % of seminomas , although rarely identiﬁed in nonsemi - nomas 19 . Thus , both germline variation and somatic mutations in the KITLG – KIT signaling pathway are associated with TGCT . In addition , KITLG – KIT signaling has an important role in male ferti - lity 20 , and mutations in Kitl lead to decreased germ cell number . Our ﬁndings suggest that the reported epidemiological association between TGCT and male infertility 21 may be due , in part , to a common genetic basis . As KITLG has a role in determining level of pigmentation 22 , we postulated that inherited variation at this locus could provide a genetic explanation for the observed differences in TGCT incidence in whites and blacks . KITLG has undergone strong positive selection in the European and East Asian populations , with an extended haplotype of 400 kb 23 . Data from HapMap phase 3 show signiﬁcant differences ( P ¼ 4 . 3 (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) 20 ) in the frequency of the risk alleles of KITLG ( rs3782179 and rs4474514 ) when comparing the CEU ( major allele frequency ¼ 0 . 80 ) and ASW ( African ancestry in Southwest United States : major allele frequency ¼ 0 . 25 ) populations 10 . This ﬁnding suggests that inherited variation in KITLG may explain , in part , the observed differences in TGCT incidence between whites and blacks . We also observed an association between TGCTrisk and variation at 5q31 just downstream of SPRY4 . As with KITLG , the major allele was associated with increased risk . SPRY4 is one of a family of four genes ( SPRY1 - 4 ) that have been implicated as negative regulators of the RAS - ERK - MAPK signaling pathway in response to growth factors 24 . Expression analyses and tumor studies have shown that SPRY4 is the most signiﬁcantly downregulated gene when KITsignaling is inhibited by imatinib mesylate in gastrointestinal stromal tumors , supporting a functional relationship between the two proteins 12 . In summary , our results demonstrate that common genetic variants at the 12p22 and 5q31 loci are associated with TGCT and strongly implicate KITLG as a susceptibility gene in the pathogenesis of TGCT . In addition , these observations may explain , in part , two important features of the disease : the increased incidence in whites and the epidemiological association with male infertility .

For the discovery phase , we initially selected 353 individuals with TGCT seen at UPHS ( n ¼ 303 ) and FCCC ( n ¼ 50 ) ; all cases were from the Philadelphia region . TGCT cases from UPHS were from an ongoing clinic - based case - control study of genetic susceptibility of TGCT for which study participants were asked to complete a self - administered ques - tionnaire that elicited information on known and presumptive risk factors for TGCT . TGCT cases from FCCC were obtained from the Biosample Repository Facility , which collects and stores blood samples and obtains information on family history of cancer , risk factors and demographics from participating subjects . We classiﬁed each individual with TGCTaccording to the histological diagnosis of his tumor : seminoma or nonseminoma ( including yolk sac , choriocarcinoma , embryonal , teratoma and mixed cell type TGCT ) germ cell tumor . Only those with primary disease in the testis were included . Male controls ( n ¼ 932 ) were selected from PennCATH , a UPHS single - center , hospital - based study of angiographic coronary artery disease ( CAD ) in almost 4 , 000 subjects undergoing cardiac catheterization . This study investi - gates the association of biochemical and genetic factors for CAD and its risk factors 25 ; information on personal history of cancer was not collected . All controls were from the Philadelphia region , 90 % were 46 years or older and had already passed the peak age of TGCT development . On the basis of available age - speciﬁc TGCT rates , we estimated that only four TGCT cases would be expected to have arisen in this control group 1 . It is unlikely that this potential small misclassiﬁcation of phenotype would have biased results appreciably . Controls had been genotyped previously using the Affymetrix Genome - Wide Human SNP Array 6 . 0 platform and had passed genotyping quality controls measures analogous to those used for TGCT cases ( see below ) . We used the Affymetrix Genome - Wide Human SNP Array 6 . 0 to obtain genotypes for TGCT cases . We used the Birdseed algorithm to determine genotypes for the combined TGCT case and CAD control sample set 26 . Among the 353 case samples , 18 subsequently were excluded for not meeting case eligibility ( two Leydig cell tumors , one female germ cell tumor erroneously coded as TGCT , 15 non - TGCT samples ) , and 11 replicate samples with lower genotyping call rates were excluded . Of the 324 unique samples from TGCT cases , 19 ( 5 . 9 % ) were excluded because of a low ( o 95 % ) genotyping call rate , 8 ( 2 . 5 % ) because of lower than expected genotypic heterozygosity across called markers ( F ST Z 0 . 06 ) and 20 ( 6 . 2 % ) because of Asian or African ancestry as determined by multidimensional scaling ( MDS ) 27 ; no cases were excluded for cryptic relatedness ( proportion of genotypes identical by descent for all cases was o 0 . 20 ) . Among the 932 CAD controls , 13 were excluded because of female or ambiguous sex . After exclusion of 224 , 705 ( 24 . 7 % ) markers with a minor allele frequency ( in the total sample ) o 0 . 05 , 1 , 594 ( 0 . 2 % ) that deviated from Hardy - Weinberg equilibrium ( HWE ; P o 1 (cid:1) 10 (cid:2) 7 ) , 71 , 978 ( 7 . 9 % ) with an individual genotype call rate o 0 . 95 and 233 ( 0 . 03 % ) invalid markers , 611 , 112 markers remained in the discovery phase . To further investigate potential bias that could arise from our choice of control group , we compared the minor allele frequencies of markers brought into replication between those controls with veriﬁed coronary heart disease ( n ¼ 700 ) and those without ( n ¼ 219 ) . We noted no statistically signiﬁcant differences for the six markers , nor did we observe differences when comparing the PennCath study subjects to population - based controls used in the replica - tion phase ( data not shown ) . Replication study . To replicate ﬁndings of the discovery phase , we used 371 cases , 860 controls and 204 sets of mothers and fathers of cases from a population - based case - control study of TGCT in western Washington . Methods for recruitment of TGCT cases and parents in this study previously have been published 28 . Brieﬂy , all cases had ﬁrst , primary TGCT diagnosed between 1999 and 2007 and were residents of three urban counties of western Washington aged 18 to 44 years at diagnosis . Control subjects did not have a personal history of TGCTand were frequency - matched on age and ascertained from the general population of the three counties using random digit telephone dialing . Family history of TGCT among ﬁrst - degree relatives and personal history of cryptorchidism was ascertained through self - administered questionnaires . Only cases and controls who self - identiﬁed as white , non - Hispanic were included in the replication study . Genotyping was accomplished using predesigned TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays according to manufacturer’s speciﬁcations . Genotyping was run in duplicate for 1 , 034 marker pairs ( an average of 172 sample pairs per each of the six markers in replication ) . In total , six ( 0 . 58 % ) calls were discordant ; the Spearman correlation coefﬁcient was 4 0 . 99 . Genotyping calls were made without knowledge of case or duplicate status . We also regenotyped the majority ( 94 – 99 % ) of TGCT cases from the discovery phase for markers in Table 2 . Concordance between genotype calls obtained from the Affymetrix chip and TaqMan assays for these four makers was 100 % . For both the genome - wide scan and replication study , all participants provided written informed consent approved by their local institutional review boards . Statistical analysis . For the discovery phase , we used PLINK software to adjust for missing genotypes and calculate rates of heterozygosity 29 . Population stratiﬁcation was assessed using multi - dimensional scaling ( MDS ) methods and all markers were tested for HWE . PLINK also was used to determine genotypic associations among the 277 TGCT cases and 919 CAD controls . We assessed statistical signiﬁcance using Fisher’s exact test , and for top hits we determined ORs and 95 % CIs for the per - allele , heterozygous and homozygous effects of the minor allele ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . Imputation was conducted using a computationally efﬁcient hidden Markov model – based algorithm as implemented in software MACH 30 . MACH com - bines our genotyped data with phased chromosomes from the HapMap CEU samples and then infers the unknown genotypes in the study sample prob - abilistically by searching for similar stretches of ﬂanking haplotype in the HapMap CEU reference sample . We analyzed only markers that passed the following imputation quality control criteria : R 2 4 0 . 3 and MAF 4 0 . 05 in both cases and controls . To account for uncertainty involved in the imputa - tion , we analyzed case - control associations for imputed SNP markers using software SNPTEST 31 . For the replication phase , analyses were conducted using SAS v9 . 1 . 3 . We used unconditional logistic regression to determine per - allele associations and associations of homozygous and heterozygous carriage of risk alleles with case status ( overall and among speciﬁed subgroups ) , and present unadjusted ORs because age was not a confounder in our data . We assessed trend across genotype categories by the Cochran - Armitage test for trend . Models containing markers coded on an ordinal scale ( additive model ) and a cross - product term were made to test for marker - marker interaction . To estimate and compare the associations within TGCT subtypes , we used multi - nomial logit models to obtain simultaneously the OR and 95 % CI for the association between markers and each level of outcome after adjusting for age .
