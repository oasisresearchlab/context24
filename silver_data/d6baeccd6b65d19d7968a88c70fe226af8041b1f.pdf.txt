We examined the involvement of the major lysosome membrane ‐ associated LAMP proteins in MT invasion . First , human epithelial HeLa cells were incubated with MT in the presence of antibody to LAMP ‐ 1 or LAMP ‐ 2 . Antibody to LAMP ‐ 2 , but not to LAMP ‐ 1 , significantly reduced MT invasion . Next , HeLa cells depleted in LAMP ‐ 1 or LAMP ‐ 2 were generated . Cells deficient in LAMP ‐ 2 , but not in LAMP ‐ 1 , were significantly more resistant to MT invasion than wild ‐ type controls . The possibility that LAMP ‐ 2 might be the receptor for gp82 was examined by co ‐ immunoprecipitation assays . Protein A / G magnetic beads cross ‐ linked with antibody directed to LAMP ‐ 1 or LAMP ‐ 2 were incubated with HeLa cell and MT detergent extracts . Gp82 bound to LAMP ‐ 2 but not to LAMP ‐ 1 . Binding of the recombinant gp82 protein to wild ‐ type and LAMP ‐ 1 ‐ deficient cells , which was dose dependent and saturable , had a similar profile and was much higher as compared with LAMP ‐ 2 ‐ depleted cells . These data indicate that MT invasion is accomplished through recognition of gp82 by its receptor LAMP ‐ 2 . KEYWORDS cell invasion , Gp82 receptor , LAMP protein , Trypanosoma cruzi 1 | INTRODUCTION Many pathogenic microorganisms invade host cells as the first step for the establishment of infection . Among the mechanisms used by differ - ent pathogens for their internalisation is the binding of a surface pro - tein to the target cell surface receptor , which triggers signalling cascades leading to events , such as the actin cytoskeleton remodelling ( Cossart & Sansonetti , 2004 ) . The outer membrane proteins internalin A and invasin , which interact with human E ‐ cadherin and integrin receptors , mediate the invasion of enteropathogenic bacteria Listeria and Yersinia , respectively ( Cossart , Pizarro ‐ Cerdá , & Lecuit , 2003 ; Isberg & Barnes , 2001 ) . Trypanosoma cruzi , the protozoan parasite that causes Chagas dis - ease , is thought to enter host cells in a receptor ‐ dependent manner . Surface glycoproteins belonging to the gp85 / trans ‐ sialidase superfam - ily , such as gp82 and Tc85 , have been identified as the main T . cruzi molecules implicated in cell invasion ( Alves & Colli , 2007 ; Yoshida , 2006 ) .

Prokineticin recep - tors , distributed in many different tissues , were described as potential receptor for the Tc85 glycoproteins expressed in tissue culture trypomastigotes ( TCTs ) , which are equivalent to parasites circulating in the mammalian host bloodstream ( Khusal et al . , 2015 ) . MT ‐ specific gp82 and Tc85 expressed inTCT are presumably recognised by differ - ent receptors , provided that they have distinct adhesion properties . Gp82 protein binds to gastric mucin , a property relevant for T . cruzi infection by the oral route ( Staquicini et al . , 2010 ) , but its affinity for components such as laminin , heparan sulfate , and collagen is minimal ( Cortez , Yoshida , Bahia , & Sobreira , 2012 ; Ramirez , Ruiz , Araya , Da Silveira , & Yoshida , 1993 ) , whereas Tc85 glycoproteins bind to laminin and fibronectin , among other extracellular matrix factors ( Giordano et al . , 1999 ; Ouaissi , Cornette , & Capron , 1986 ) . Binding of gp82 molecule to target cells induces lysosome spreading that cul - minates in exocytosis and MT internalisation in a vacuole containing lysosome ‐ associated membrane proteins ( LAMPs ; Cortez , Real , & Yoshida , 2016 ; Martins , Alves , Macedo , & Yoshida , 2011 ) . TCT inter - action with host cells has been associated with microfilament rear - rangement and lysosome exocytosis triggered by a nonidentified soluble TCT factor ( Rodríguez , Rioult , Ora , & Andrews , 1995 ; Rodríguez , Samoff , Rioult , Chung , & Andrews , 1996 ) , the parasite being internalised in a vacuole expressing plasma membrane markers ( Woolsey et al . , 2003 ) . Lysosome exocytosis contributes to TCT inva - sion by stimulating endocytosis associated with the delivery of acid sphingomyelinase to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane ( Fernandes et al . , 2011 ) . Lysosomes play a critical role in gp82 ‐ mediated MT invasion . Conditions that increase lysosome biogenesis and scattering were found to increase MT internalisation , whereas factors that induced lysosome accumulation in the perinuclear region had an opposite effect ( Cortez et al . , 2016 ) . What remains to be determined is whether the major lysosome ‐ associated membrane proteins LAMP ‐ 1 and LAMP ‐ 2 are implicated in MT invasion . Here , we addressed that ques - tion and investigated the possibility that either LAMP ‐ 1 or LAMP ‐ 2 could be the receptor for MT surface molecule gp82 . 2 | RESULTS 2 . 1 | T . cruzi MT invasion requires host cell LAMP ‐ 2 and does not rely on plasma membrane repair mechanism The requirement of lysosomes for gp82 ‐ mediated MT invasion has been revealed using human epithelial HeLa cells . As a first approach to determine whether LAMP proteins are implicated , invasion assays using anti ‐ LAMP antibodies were performed . HeLa cells were incu - bated for 1 hr with MT in the absence or in the presence of antibody to human LAMP ‐ 1 or LAMP ‐ 2 , at 7 μ g ml − 1 , or in the presence of both antibodies . After fixation and Giemsa staining , the number of intracel - lular parasites was counted . Antibody directed to LAMP ‐ 2 , but not to LAMP ‐ 1 , significantly inhibited MT internalisation , and the presence of both antibodies did not have a higher inhibitory effect ( Figure 1a ) . FIGURE 1 Involvement of LAMP ‐ 2 in Trypanosoma cruzi metacyclic trypomastigote ( MT ) invasion . HeLa cells were incubated for 1 hr with MT in the absence or in the presence of anti ‐ LAMP1 or anti ‐ LAMP2 antibody or with both antibodies at 7 μ g ml − 1 ( a ) or with anti ‐ LAMP2 antibody at indicated concentrations ( b ) , and the internalised parasites were quantified . Values are the means ± standard deviation of four ( a ) or three ( b ) independent assays performed in duplicate . MT invasion diminished significantly in the presence of anti ‐ LAMP2 antibody alone or when both antibodies were present ( * P < 0 . 0005 ) . ( b ) The inhibitory effect of anti ‐ LAMP2 antibody was dose dependent and significant ( * P < 0 . 05 and * * P < 0 . 005 ) . ( c ) Wild ‐ type ( WT ) mouse fibroblast cell lines and their counterparts deficient in LAMP ‐ 1 , in LAMP ‐ 2 , or in both proteins , were incubated with MT for 1 hr . Internalised parasites were counted in each duplicate from three independent assays . As compared with WT controls , MT invasion was significantly lower in LAMP ‐ 2 − / − and in double knockout cells ( * P < 0 . 005 and * * P < 0 . 0001 ) . ( d ) HeLa cells were incubated with MT for 1 hr in PBS + + medium with or without Ca 2 + . Internalised parasites were counted in each duplicate from three independent assays . The rate of MT invasion was similar in the absence or in the presence of Ca 2 + . HeLa cells were incubated for 1 hr with MT in the absence or in the presence of streptolysin O ( SLO ) at indicated concentrations ( e ) or were preincubated with SLO for 20 min and then discarded before addition of parasites ( f ) . Values are the means ± standard deviation of three independent assays performed in duplicate . Incubation in the presence of SLO significantly inhibited MT invasion ( * P < 0 . 001 and * * P < 0 . 0001 ) , whereas pretreatment of cells had no effect 2 of 11 RODRIGUES ET AL . The effect of antibody to LAMP ‐ 2 at different concentrations was also tested . Inhibition of MT invasion by anti ‐ LAMP2 antibody was dose dependent ( Figure 1b ) . To further ascertain the involvement of LAMP ‐ 2 in MT entry into HeLa cells , the strategy of generating cells depleted in LAMP ‐ 1 or LAMP ‐ 2 was contemplated . Although attempts in that direction were under way , we performed experiments with mouse fibroblast cell lines and their counterparts deficient in LAMP ‐ 1 , in LAMP ‐ 2 , or in both proteins , which were generated in Dr Paul Saftig ' s laboratory ( Eskelinen et al . , 2004 ) , by incubating MT with the cells for 1 hr , followed by processing for intracellular parasite counting . MT invasion was significantly lower in LAMP ‐ 2 ‐ deficient and in double knockout cells , whereas no difference in invasion was observed in LAMP ‐ 1 ‐ deficient cells as compared with wild ‐ type con - trols ( Figure 1c ) . As LAMP ‐ 2 was reported to be required for TCT invasion by contributing for plasma membrane repair ( Couto et al . , 2017 ) , experiments were performed to determine whether MT internalisation also relied on plasma membrane injury and repair mech - anism used by TCT ( Fernandes et al . , 2011 ) . One experiment consisted in incubating HeLa cells with MT in PBS + + medium ( Cortez et al . , 2016 ) with or without Ca 2 + . In contrast to TCT invasion , which in the absence of extracellular Ca 2 + ( condition nonpermissive for repair ) is drastically reduced ( Fernandes et al . , 2011 ) , the number of MT that entered cells was similar in the absence or in the presence of Ca 2 + ( Figure 1d ) . Another experiment consisted in incubating HeLa cells with MT in the presence of the pore ‐ forming bacterial toxin streptoly - sin O ( SLO ) . As opposed toTCT invasion , which increased by ~ 60 % in the presence of SLO at 50 ng ml − 1 at repair ‐ permissive condition ( Fernandes et al . , 2011 ) , MT invasion diminished by ~ 50 % and ~ 70 % at 50 and 100 ng ml − 1 of SLO , respectively ( Figure 1e ) , suggesting that SLO treatment affected MT – host cell interaction . When Hela cells were preincubated for 20 min with SLO at 50 or 100 ng ml − 1 , before incubation with parasites , no inhibitory effect on MT invasion was observed ( Figure 1f ) , in contrast to the reported inhibition of TCT internalisation by more than 50 % in cells pretreated with 50 ng ml − 1 of SLO ( Fernandes et al . , 2011 ) . The permeabilisation of HeLa cells by SLO was ascertained by treating cells with propidium iodide in the absence of Ca 2 + ( Figure S1 ) . These data indicate that MT invasion is independent of plasma membrane injury and repair mechanism . Lentiviral transduction methodology was employed to generate HeLa cells depleted in LAMP , using four different target sequences , two for LAMP ‐ 1 and two for LAMP ‐ 2 . We produced four cell lines , which were analysed by Western blot using specific antibodies . LAMP ‐ 1 was knocked down ( kd ) and was barely detectable in two cell lines ( LAMP1 ‐ kd1 and LAMP1 ‐ kd2 ) , LAMP ‐ 2 was depleted in one cell line ( LAMP2 ‐ kd1 ) , but in the other cell line ( LAMP2 ‐ kd2 ) , it was not so clear ( Figure 2a ) . Therefore , we performed an additional Western blot assay and confirmed that depletion was less effective in LAMP2 ‐ kd2 cells ( Figure S2 ) . The different cell lines were analysed by confocal immunofluorescence , using anti ‐ LAMP antibodies . Control wild ‐ type cells reacted similarly with both antibodies ( Figure 2b ) . Compatible with the Western blot profile , the LAMP ‐ deficient cells reacted accordingly with antibody to LAMP ‐ 1 or LAMP ‐ 2 ( Figure 2c ) . Cells deficient in LAMP protein were examined for their susceptibility to MT invasion . MT internalisation decreased significantly in LAMP2 ‐ kd1 cells , whereas the diminished susceptibility of LAMP2 ‐ kd2 cells to MT invasion was not statistically significant , and LAMP ‐ 1 ‐ deficient cells were as susceptible to MT invasion as the wild ‐ type controls ( Figure 3a ) . Confocal microscopy analysis was also performed with LAMP ‐ depleted cells incubated for 30 min with MT . In LAMP1 ‐ kd1 populations , parasites were seen internalised or associated with cells ( Figure 3b , left panel ) , regardless whether LAMP ‐ 1 expression was high ( red arrows ) , moderate ( orange arrows ) , or negative ( white arrows ) . On the other hand , in LAMP2 ‐ kd1 populations , MT internalisation was restricted to a few LAMP ‐ 2 ‐ positive cells ( Figure 3b , right panel , red arrows ) . Overall , these results support the notion that MT invasion is dependent on LAMP ‐ 2 . 2 . 2 | MT gp82 binds to LAMP ‐ 2 protein in a receptor ‐ mediated manner As our data indicated that gp82 ‐ mediated MT invasion requires LAMP ‐ 2 , we examined the possibility that gp82 binds to LAMP ‐ 2 by performing co ‐ immunoprecipitation assays . Protein A / G magnetic beads cross ‐ linked with antibody to LAMP ‐ 1 ( bead L1 ) or LAMP ‐ 2 ( bead L2 ) were incubated with HeLa cell extract for 1 hr , washed , and then incubated for 1 hr with MT lysate , followed by washings and elution . The eluted samples , which correspond to the immunopre - cipitates ( IPs ) , were analysed by Western blotting using antibodies to LAMP proteins or to gp82 , along with flowthrough samples ( Figure 4a ) . In IP from L1 beads , LAMP ‐ 1 appeared as a strong band and gp82 as a faint band , and in IP from LAMP2 beads , both LAMP ‐ 2 and gp82 were detected as bands of high intensity , whereas no pro - tein was detectable in IP from control empty ( V ) beads ( Figure 4a ) . Analysis of flowthrough from LAMP1 and LAMP2 beads showed that the amounts of HeLa cell extracts or MT lysates applied to beads were equivalent ( Figure 4a ) . Binding of native gp82 to LAMP ‐ 2 was further confirmed by two additional experiments . In one of them , new batches of beads L1 and L2 were prepared and used as described above . LAMP ‐ 2 and gp82 were revealed in IP from L2 beads as strong bands , whereas gp82 was not detected in IP from L1 beads ( Figure 4b ) . Another experiment consisted in preparing beads cross ‐ linked to anti ‐ gp82 monoclonal antibody and incubating them first with MT lysates and then with HeLa cell extracts ( Figure 4c ) . Both LAMP ‐ 2 and gp82 were detected in IP from gp82 ‐ beads ( Figure 4c ) . IP from L1 beads was also analysed using anti ‐ LAMP1 and anti ‐ gp82 antibodies . We detected LAMP ‐ 1 but not gp82 in IP from L1 beads ( Figure 4d ) . To demonstrate that gp82 binds to LAMP ‐ 2 in a receptor ‐ dependent manner , we performed an enzyme ‐ linked immunosorbent assay using microtitre plates coated with cells depleted in LAMP ‐ 1 or LAMP ‐ 2 and with wild ‐ type cells as control . The recombinant gp82 protein ( r ‐ gp82 ) was added to cells , at varying concentrations , and after 1 ‐ hr incubation , the binding was revealed as described in Section 4 . Binding of r ‐ gp82 to cells was dose dependent and satura - ble and was much lower in LAMP ‐ 2 ‐ deficient cells than in wild ‐ type and LAMP ‐ 1 ‐ depleted cells ( Figure 5a ) . Competition assay using anti ‐ LAMP antibody was also performed using wild ‐ type HeLa cells . Varying amounts of r ‐ gp82 were incubated for 1 hr with Hela cells in the presence of antibody to LAMP ‐ 1 or LAMP ‐ 2 , at 10 μ g ml − 1 ( Figure 5b ) . In the presence of anti ‐ LAMP2 antibody , r ‐ gp82 binding RODRIGUES ET AL . 3 of 11 was much lower than in the presence of LAMP ‐ 1 ( Figure 5b ) , reinforc - ing the notion that LAMP ‐ 2 is the receptor for gp82 . Binding of gp82 to cells was also examined by confocal immuno - fluorescence . Cells were incubated for 1 hr with recombinant gp82 protein ( r ‐ gp82 ) at 20 μ g ml − 1 and then processed for immuno - fluorescence using anti ‐ gp82 monoclonal antibody ( Figure 5c ) . The r ‐ gp82 protein bound to wild ‐ type and LAMP1 ‐ kd1 cells , the vast majority of cells showing a strong reaction with anti ‐ gp82 anti - body , and noteworthy was the accumulation of r ‐ gp82 at the cell edges ( Figure 5c , red arrows ) , which are the MT invasion sites ( Mortara , 1991 ) , suggesting a clustering of gp82 receptors at these sites . In LAMP2 ‐ kd1 cells , fewer cells reacted with anti ‐ gp82 anti - body , and r ‐ gp82 accumulation at the cell periphery was less evident ( Figure 5c , lower panel ) . An experiment was performed to ascertain that r ‐ gp82 induces lysosome scattering , as previously reported ( Cortez et al . , 2016 ) . HeLa cells were incubated for 30 min with r ‐ gp82 at 20 μ g ml − 1 , followed by reaction with anti ‐ LAMP2 antibody and confocal microscopy analysis . Lysosome spreading from the perinuclear region to the cell periphery was induced by r ‐ gp82 , and accumulation of LAMP ‐ 2 on the cell bor - ders was clearly visualised ( Figure S3 , red arrows ) . We examined the localization of LAMP ‐ 2 at the HeLa cell plasma membrane upon inter - action with r ‐ gp82 . HeLa cells were incubated in the absence or in the presence of 20 μ g ml − 1 of r ‐ gp82 for 30 min , followed by reaction with rabbit antibody to LAMP ‐ 2 and mouse anti ‐ HeLa cell antibody that predominantly recognises the plasma membrane . The second antibody consisted of Alexa Fluor 555 ‐ conjugated anti ‐ rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 488 ‐ conjugated anti ‐ mouse IgG . Localization of FIGURE 2 Depletion of LAMP proteins in HeLa cells . ( a ) HeLa cells were submitted to lentiviral transduction for LAMP ‐ 1 or LAMP ‐ 2 knock ‐ down ( kd ) and then analysed by Western blotting ( WB ) using the indicated antibodies . Note the depletion of LAMP ‐ 1 in two independent cell lines and of LAMP ‐ 2 in two other cell lines . ( b ) HeLa cells were analysed by confocal fluorescence microscopy using antibody to LAMP ‐ 1 or LAMP ‐ 2 , Alexa Fluor 488 ‐ conjugated anti ‐ mouse IgG ( green ) , and DAPI ( blue ) for DNA , with 63× objective . Scale bar = 20 μ m . ( c ) LAMP ‐ depleted HeLa cells were analysed by confocal fluorescence microscopy using antibody to LAMP ‐ 1 or LAMP ‐ 2 , as in ( b ) . WT : wild ‐ type 4 of 11 RODRIGUES ET AL . LAMP ‐ 2 at the plasma membrane increased upon interaction with r ‐ gp82 ( Figure S4 , white arrows ) . 2 . 3 | Invasion of extracellular amastigote increases in LAMP ‐ depleted cells Cell invasion experiment with LAMP ‐ depleted cells was also performed with extracellular amastigote ( EA ) derived fromTCT . Differ - ently from MT invasion , EA internalisation of HeLa cells is indepen - dent of lysosome mobilisation ( Procópio , Da Silva , Cunningham , & Mortara , 1998 ) . HeLa cells were incubated with EA for 2 hr , and the number of intracellular parasites was counted . As shown in Figure 6 a , the number of parasites that entered cells deficient in LAMP ‐ 1 or LAMP ‐ 2 increased significantly as compared with that internalised by wild ‐ type cells . For confocal microscopy , wild ‐ type HeLa cells were incubated for 1 hr with EA , followed by reaction with anti ‐ LAMP anti - body . There was no association of EA with lysosome marker during invasion ( Figure 6b , red arrows ) , differently from MT internalisation ( Figure 3b ) . This is compatible with the report that , during HeLa inva - sion of EA , which depends on the formation of plasma membrane expansions , the parasites at the cell periphery are weakly labelled with anti ‐ LAMP antibody ( Procópio et al . , 1998 ) . The formation of cup ‐ like projections around the invading EA ( Procópio , Barros , & Mortara , 1999 ) may be affected by lysosomes . 3 | DISCUSSION The involvement of host cell LAMP ‐ 2 in gp82 ‐ mediated MT invasion was revealed in experiments using cells depleted in LAMP ‐ 1 or LAMP ‐ 2 . Our results have also shown that the MT surface molecule gp82 binds to LAMP ‐ 2 , suggesting that LAMP ‐ 2 is the long sought after receptor for gp82 . In HeLa cells cultured in complete medium , lysosomes accumulate in the perinuclear region . Therefore , the levels of LAMP proteins on the cell surface are probably very low . LAMP proteins have been detected on the plasma membrane of other human cell lines , and their expression was shown to increase after exposure to a lysosomotropic reagent ( Mane et al . , 1989 ) . In HeLa cells , a short ‐ term incubation in nutrient ‐ depleted medium , a condition that promotes lysosome scattering to the cell periphery and exocytosis , stimulates gp82 ‐ mediated MT invasion ( Cortez et al . , 2016 ) . Experi - ments with the recombinant gp82 protein have shown that it can induce lysosome spreading and accumulation of LAMP ‐ 2 protein at the MT invasion sites . On the basis of these findings , we envision a scenario ( Figure 7 ) in which MT attachment to host cells relies on gp82 recognition by LAMP ‐ 2 present at low levels on the cell surface . FIGURE 3 Reduced susceptibility of LAMP ‐ 2 ‐ deficient HeLa cells to metacyclic trypomastigote ( MT ) invasion . ( a ) HeLa cells depleted in either LAMP ‐ 1 or LAMP ‐ 2 as well as wild ‐ type ( WT ) control were incubated for 1 hr with MT . The amounts of intracellular parasites are shown as means ± standard deviation of three independent assays performed in duplicate . MT invasion was significantly diminished in cells deficient in LAMP ‐ 2 ( * P < 0 . 005 ) . ( b ) HeLa cells depleted in LAMP ‐ 1 or LAMP ‐ 2 were incubated for 30 min with MT and visualised by confocal microscopy , upon reaction with antibody to LAMP ‐ 1 or LAMP ‐ 2 as in Figure 2b , with 100× objective . Scale bar = 10 μ m . Note that in the left panel , parasites internalised in cells expressing LAMP ‐ 1 at higher levels ( red arrows ) and lower levels ( orange arrows ) or in LAMP1 ‐ negative cells ( white arrows ) . In the right panel , parasites internalised in a few LAMP ‐ 2 ‐ positive cells ( red arrows ) are shown RODRIGUES ET AL . 5 of 11 This attachment triggers the lysosome mobilisation towards the cell periphery , further increasing the LAMP ‐ 2 protein available at the plasma membrane . When the mode of MT invasion is compared with that of TCT , considerable differences emerge . In the case of TCT , only a minor pro - portion of parasites associate with lysosomes , the majority acquires plasma membrane markers at early times of infection ( Woolsey et al . , 2003 ) . However , the involvement of LAMP proteins has been reported . Increased expression of LAMP ‐ 1 on the plasma membrane of CHO cells was associated with higher susceptibility toTCT invasion ( Kima , Burleigh , & Andrews , 2000 ) . LAMP ‐ 1 / 2 double ‐ deficient mouse fibroblasts were shown to be less susceptible toTCT invasion ( Albertti , Macedo , Chiari , Andrews , & Andrade , 2010 ) . Recently , it was reported that mouse fibroblasts deficient in LAMP ‐ 2 were less permissive to invasion by TCT because LAMP ‐ 2 absence influences the distribution of caveolin ‐ 1 at the cell plasma membrane , which is crucial for plasma membrane repair ( Couto et al . , 2017 ) . The mechanism of TCT internalisation relies on plasma membrane injury and repair that involves lysosome exocytosis ( Fernandes et al . , 2011 ) . Our results have clearly indicated that MT invasion is independent of plasma membrane injury and repair mechanism . Invasion by MT and TCT also differs as concerns the lysosome mobilisation . MT induces spreading of lysosomes from the perinuclear region to the cell periphery ( Cortez et al . , 2016 ) , whereas only the lysosomes proximal toTCT invasion site are mobilised ( Rodríguez et al . , 1996 ) . Through distinct mechanisms , MT and TCT enter host cells in a manner dependent on lysosome mobilisation and exocytosis , but invasion by EA is lysosome independent ( Procópio et al . , 1998 ) . This may be related to the differential interaction of these parasite forms with the target cell membrane domains . Microvilli on the dorsal FIGURE 4 Binding of metacyclic trypomastigote ( MT ) gp82 to LAMP ‐ 2 . ( a ) Protein A / G magnetic beads , cross ‐ linked to antibody to LAMP ‐ 1 or LAMP ‐ 2 , were incubated for 1 hr with HeLa cell extracts and afterwards with MT lysates for 1 hr . The eluates corresponding to immunoprecipitates ( IPs ) were analysed by Western blot ( WB ) . Shown are the IP from LAMP1 beads ( L1 ) , LAMP2 beads ( L2 ) , control void beads ( V ) , and the flowthrough samples from L1 and L2 beads corresponding to HeLa cell extract ( cell flow ) or MT lysate ( MT flow ) . The blots were revealed with a mix of antibodies to LAMP ‐ 1 and LAMP ‐ 2 or with anti ‐ gp82 antibody . Note that both LAMP ‐ 2 and gp82 were detected in IP from L2 beads . ( b ) The assay described in ( a ) was repeated with a new batch of protein A / G magnetic beads cross ‐ linked to antibody to LAMP ‐ 1 or LAMP ‐ 2 . Note the presence of LAMP ‐ 2 and gp82 in IP from L2 beads . No bands were detected in IP from L1 beads . ( c ) Protein A / G magnetic beads , cross ‐ linked to anti ‐ gp82 monoclonal antibody , were incubated with MT lysate for 1 hr , followed by 1 ‐ hr incubation with HeLa cell extract . The WB of IP revealed LAMP ‐ 2 and gp82 . Shown also are the flowthorough samples corresponding to HeLa cell extract ( cell flow ) and MT lysate ( MT flow ) . ( d ) LAMP1 beads were incubated with HeLa cell extract for 1 hr , followed by 1 ‐ hr incubation with MT lysate . The WB of IP was revealed with antibody to LAMP ‐ 1 and gp82 . Also shown are the cell flow and MT flow , which served as control . Note that gp82 is absent in IP from L1 beads 6 of 11 RODRIGUES ET AL . surface are the sites of EA invasion , whereas MT and TCT interaction with cells occurs at the cell edges ( Mortara , 1991 ; Procópio et al . , 1999 ; Schenkman , Andrews , Nussenzweig , & Robbins , 1988 ) . Disrup - tion of host cell actin microfilaments is induced by MT and TCT ( Cortez , Atayde , & Yoshida , 2006 ; Rodríguez et al . , 1995 ) , and this may facilitate lysosome mobilisation . On the other hand , actin microfilaments are recruited during EA invasion , and actin ‐ enriched cup ‐ like membrane protrusions are seen around the parasite ( Procópio et al . , 1998 ) . From the present studies on MT invasion and from available data on EA internalisation , we infer that the different T . cruzi forms have developed specific strategies to enter target cells , making use of stage ‐ specific surface molecules to interact with host cells , such as MT gp82 and EA Ssp4 . The amastigote ‐ specific glycoprotein Ssp4 ( Andrews , Hong , Robbins , & Nussenzweig , 1987 ; Andrews , Robbins , Ley , Hong , & Nussenzweig , 1988 ) binds to target cells through its carbohydrate moiety ( Silva , Luquetti , Rassi , & Mortara , 2006 ) , and this leads to the parasite engulfment that resembles a phagocytic process ( Bonfim ‐ Melo , Ferreira , & Mortara , 2018 ; Fernandes , Flannery , Andrews , & Mortara , 2013 ) . It has been reported that galectin ‐ 3 , a member of β ‐ galactosidase ‐ binding lectin family , which accumulates around invading EA in macrophages ( Machado et al . , 2014 ) , increased by about 20 % in HeLa cells during the phagocytic cup formation and apparently bound to Ssp ‐ 4 ( Florentino et al . , 2018 ) . MT gp82 binds to HeLa cells through its peptide portion ( Manque et al . , 2000 ) . Whether gp82 binds to a peptide sequence or to a carbohydrate portion of the highly glycosylated LAMP ‐ 2 protein remains to be determined . 4 | EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES 4 . 1 | Parasites , cell lines , and cell invasion assay T . cruzi strain CL was used for assays with MT . The parasites were maintained alternately in mice and in liver infusion tryptose medium containing 5 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) , following experimental proto - cols approved by the Committee on Ethics of Animal Experimentation of Universidade Federal de São Paulo ( CEUA 9933271016 ) . After one passage in Grace ' s medium ( Invitrogen ) to differentiate epimastigotes into MT , the parasites were purified as described ( Teixeira & Yoshida , 1986 ) . In addition to human epithelial HeLa cells , maintained as described ( Rodrigues , Takahashi Sant ' ana , Juliano , & Yoshida , 2017 ) , mouse fibroblast cell lines deficient in LAMP ‐ 1 , LAMP ‐ 2 , or double knockout cells , generated in Dr Paul Saftig ' s laboratory at University of Kiel , Germany , were used . Cell invasion assays were performed in FIGURE 5 Binding of gp82 protein to wild ‐ type ( WT ) or LAMP ‐ deficient HeLa cells .

Following washes in PBS and sequential incubation of cells for 1 hr at 37°C with anti ‐ gp82 antiserum and anti ‐ mouse IgG conjugated to peroxidase , the bound enzyme was revealed using o ‐ phenylenediamine .

Briefly , TCTs derived from Vero cells were incubated for 14 hr in liver infusion tryptose medium with 10 % FBS , pH 5 . 8 . Amastigotes were incubated in complete Roswell Park Memorial Insti - tute medium at pH 7 . 3 for 1 hr and were then seeded onto each cov - erslip coated with 1 . 5 × 10 5 HeLa cells ( multiplicity of infection = 10 ) . After 2 ‐ hr incubation , the coverslips were washed , fixed , and Giemsa stained . Internalised EA amastigotes were quantified in at least 300 cells per replicate . 4 . 2 | Anti ‐ LAMP antibodies Anti ‐ LAMP antibodies were from two sources : antibody produced in rabbit ( Sigma ‐ Aldrich , now Merck ) and anti ‐ human LAMP1 ( H4A3 ) and LAMP2 ( H4B4 ) antibodies from Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank developed under the auspices of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and maintained by The University of Iowa , Department of Biology , Iowa City , IA . 4 . 3 | Lentiviral transduction and establishment of HeLa cell lines deficient in LAMP ‐ 1 or LAMP ‐ 2 To generate LAMP ‐ deficient cell lines , we used a strategy based on a previously described procedure ( Bonfim ‐ Melo et al . , 2015 ) . Target sequences were acquired from Sigma ‐ Aldrich : LAMP ‐ 1 ( Cat Nos . TRCN0000285264 and TRCN0000029268 ) and LAMP ‐ 2 ( Cat Nos . TRCN0000029260 and TRCN0000029262 ) . For lentivirus packaging and production , HEK293T cells were plated in six ‐ well plates ( 2 . 5 × 10 5 cells per well ) and incubated for 24 hr in 2 ml of Dulbecco ' s modified Eagle ' s medium containing 10 % FBS . Transfection solution was prepared as follows : 2 . 5 μ l of FuGENE HD ( Roche ) was diluted in 97 . 5 μ l of Opt ‐ MEM ( Gibco ™ ) , mixed gently by swirling , and incu - bated for 5 min at room temperature . In another tube , 0 . 75 μ g of pLKO . 1 ( vector containing shRNA target sequence ) and 0 . 75 μ g of FIGURE 6 Increased extracellular amastigote ( EA ) internalisation in LAMP ‐ depleted HeLa cells . ( a ) HeLa cells depleted in either LAMP ‐ 1 or LAMP ‐ 2 as well as the wild ‐ type ( WT ) controls were incubated for 2 hr with EA . After fixation and Giemsa staining , the internalised parasites were quantified in at least 300 cells per replicate . Values are the means ± standard deviation of three independent assays performed in triplicate . EA invasion increased significantly in LAMP ‐ depleted cells ( * P < 0 . 05 ) . ( b ) Wild ‐ type HeLa cells were visualised by confocal microscopy after 1 ‐ hr incubation with EA and reaction with anti ‐ LAMP2 antibody , as in Figure 2b , with 63× objective . Scale bar = 20 μ m . Note the lack of association of EA with lysosome marker , more clearly visible in the magnified field ( right panel ) , corresponding to the framed region ( left panel ) 8 of 11 RODRIGUES ET AL . lentiviral packaging ( composed of equal parts of pCMV ‐ dR8 . 91 and pVSVG at 0 . 25 μ g μ l − 1 ) were mixed . The lentiviral preparation and the transfection solution were mixed gently , incubated for 30 min at room temperature , and added to HEK293T . Twenty ‐ four hours later , the medium was discarded , and 3 ml of fresh medium was added . After 48 and 72 hr , the cell culture supernatant was harvested and filtered in a 0 . 45 ‐ μ m syringe filter to remove debris . For shRNAi trans - duction , 5 × 10 4 HeLa cells were plated in six ‐ well plates , and 2 ml of HEK293T culture medium enriched in lentivirus was added to each well in the presence of 8 μ g ml − 1 of hexadimethrine bromide ( commer - cial brand name Polybrene ; Sigma ‐ Aldrich ) . After 48 hr , HeLa cells were incubated with increasing concentrations of puromycin ( 0 . 2 – 2 μ g ml − 1 ) for 2 weeks in order to select transduced cells . To evaluate the transduction efficiency , the cells were washed with PBS and lysis buffer added ( 50 mM tris – HCl , 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 % Igepal CA630 , and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail , Thermo Scien - tific ) . After centrifugation at 16 , 000 × g for 5 min , the supernatant was collected and quantified by the Bradford method . Cell lysate ( 30 μ g protein ) was applied onto a 10 % SDS ‐ PAGE gel and analysed by Western blot using antibody to LAMP ‐ 1 or LAMP ‐ 2 diluted 1 : 1 , 000 plus anti ‐ GAPDH as loading control diluted 1 : 5 , 000 . 4 . 4 | Visualisation of HeLa cell lysosomes by confocal microscopy For confocal microscopy visualisation of lysosomes , HeLa cells were processed essentially as previously described , using anti ‐ human LAMP2 antibody and Alexa Fluor 488 ‐ conjugated anti ‐ mouse IgG ( Rodrigues et al . , 2017 ) . The coverslips were mounted in ProLong Gold ( Invitrogen ) . Confocal images were acquired in a confocal microscope ( Instituto de Farmacologia e Biologia Molecular , Universidade Federal de São Paulo ) , using 63× objective . Confocal images were processed and analysed using Leica LAS AF and Imaris ( Bitplane ) software . 4 . 5 | Co ‐ immunoprecipitation and Western blotting Protein A / G magnetic beads ( Pierce Crosslink Magnetic IP / Co _ IP Kit , Thermo Scientific ) were cross ‐ linked with antibody directed to LAMP ‐ 1 or LAMP ‐ 2 according to the manufacturer ' s instructions . HeLa cell extracts were prepared by treating 3 × 10 6 cells with PBS plus 0 . 5 % nonionic detergent Igepal CA630 ( USB Corporation ) and protease inhibitor cocktail . After centrifugation at 16 , 000 × g for 10 min , the supernatant was collected and used for co ‐ immunoprecipitation assays . MT extract , equivalent to 5 × 10 8 para - sites , was prepared in the same manner as HeLa cell extract . Beads cross ‐ linked to anti ‐ LAMP antibody were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with HeLa cell extracts , under agitation . After several washes in PBS containing 0 . 25 % Igepal CA630 and 1 ‐ hr incubation with MT extract , the bound proteins were eluted and analysed by Western blotting , using antibody to LAMP ‐ 1 , LAMP ‐ 2 , or anti ‐ gp82 monoclonal antibody . Protein G magnetic beads cross ‐ linked with monoclonal antibody to gp82 were also prepared ; in this case , the beads were incubated first with MT extract and subsequently with HeLa cell lysates . The bound proteins were eluted and analysed by Western blotting . 4 . 6 | Production and purification of recombinant protein gp82 ( r ‐ gp82 ) and cell ‐ binding assay The recombinant protein coded by the full ‐ length T . cruzi gp82 sequence in frame with glutathione S ‐ transferase ( GenBank ™ data base , Accession Number L14824 ) was produced and purified as detailed ( Cortez et al . , 2006 ) . For cell ‐ binding assay , HeLa cells were seeded onto 96 ‐ well microtitre plates at 4 × 10 4 cells per well and were grown overnight at 37°C . After fixation with 4 % paraformalde - hyde in PBS , washings with PBS , and blocking with PBS containing 2 mg ml − 1 of BSA ( PBS ‐ BSA ) for 1 hr at room temperature , the cells were incubated for 1 hr at 37°C with r ‐ gp82 in PBS ‐ BSA . Following washes and 1 ‐ hr incubation with anti ‐ gp82 polyclonal antiserum diluted in PBS ‐ FBS , the cells were incubated with anti ‐ mouse IgG conjugated to peroxidase . The bound enzyme was revealed using FIGURE 7 Model for host cell invasion by T . cruzi metacyclic trypomastigote ( MT ) mediated by gp82 binding to LAMP ‐ 2 protein . MT gp82 binds to host cell LAMP ‐ 2 , present at low levels at the plasma membrane , and triggers lysosome scattering to the cell periphery . This increases the availability of LAMP ‐ 2 as receptor for gp82 and further promotes MT internalisation within a vacuole resulting from the fusion of lysosomes with the plasma membrane RODRIGUES ET AL . 9 of 11 o ‐ phenylenediamine , and the absorbance at 490 nm was read in ELx800 ™ microplate reader ( BioTek ) . 4 . 7 | Statistical analysis The Student ' s t ‐ test ( GraphPad software Version 6 . 01 ) was employed .
