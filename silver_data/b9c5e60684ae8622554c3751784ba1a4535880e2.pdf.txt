The following guidelines are consistent with ad - vice given in the Publication Manual of the American Psychologi - cal Association , 6th ed . ( Washington : APA , 2010 ) , and typical requirements for undergraduate papers . Formatting the paper Many instructors in the social sciences require students to fol - low APA guidelines for formatting a paper . NOTE ON APA GuidEliNEs fOr sTudENT PAPErs : The APA manual provides guidelines for papers prepared for publication in a scholarly journal ; it does not provide specific guidelines for papers prepared for undergraduate classes . The formatting guidelines in this section and the sample paper on pages 37 – 46 are consistent with typical requirements for undergrad - uate writing . The samples on page 47 show APA formatting for a paper prepared for publication . If you are in doubt about which format is preferred or required in your course , ask your instructor . HAC _ APA . indd 32 10 / 28 / 09 3 : 35 : 35 PM 33 Formatting the paper Materials and font Use good - quality 8 1 ⁄ 2 ” × 11 ” white paper . Avoid a font that is unusual or hard to read . Title page APA provides few guidelines for formatting the title page of an undergraduate paper , but most instructors ex - pect students to include one . See the sample on page 37 . Page numbers and running head For a student paper , number all pages with arabic numerals ( 1 , 2 , 3 , and so on ) , including the title page . In the upper right - hand corner of each page , type a short version of your title , capitalizing all words of four letters or more , followed by one space and the page number . See pages 37 – 46 . For a paper submitted for publication , in the upper left - hand corner of every page place a short form of the title in all capital letters ( on the title page , include the words “Running head” followed by a colon before the paper title ) . On the same line in the right - hand corner , place the page number , beginning with 1 on the title page . See page 47 . Margins , line spacing , and paragraph indents Use margins of one inch on all sides of the page . Left - align the text . Double - space throughout the paper , but single - space foot - notes . Indent the first line of each paragraph one - half inch . Capitalization , italics , and quotation marks Capitalize all words of four letters or more in titles of works and in headings that appear in the text of the paper . Capitalize the first word after a colon if the word begins a complete sentence . Italicize the titles of books and other long works , such as Web sites . Use quotation marks around the titles of periodical articles , short stories , poems , and other short works . NOTE : APA has different requirements for titles in the refer - ence list . See page 36 . Long quotations and footnotes When a quotation is longer than forty words , set it off from the text by indenting it one - half inch from the left margin . Double - space the quotation . Do not use quotation marks around a quotation that has been set off from the text . See page 45 for an example . HAC _ APA . indd 33 10 / 28 / 09 3 : 35 : 36 PM 34 APA manuscript format Place each footnote , if any , at the bottom of the page on which the text reference occurs . Double - space between the last line of text on the page and the footnote . Indent the first line of the footnote one - half inch . Begin the note with the super - script arabic numeral that corresponds to the number in the text . See page 39 for an example . Abstract If your instructor requires an abstract , include it immediately after the title page . Center the word Abstract one inch from the top of the page ; double - space the abstract as you do the body of your paper . An abstract is a 100 - to - 150 - word paragraph that provides readers with a quick overview of your essay . It should express your main idea and your key points ; it might also briefly sug - gest any implications or applications of the research you dis - cuss in the paper . See page 38 for an example . Headings Although headings are not always necessary , their use is encouraged in the social sciences . For most undergradu - ate papers , one level of heading will usually be sufficient . In APA style , major headings are centered and boldface . Capitalize the first word of the heading , along with all words except articles , short prepositions , and coordinating conjunc - tions . See the sample paper on pages 37 – 46 . Visuals APA classifies visuals as tables and figures ( figures in - clude graphs , charts , drawings , and photographs ) . Keep visu - als as simple as possible . Label each table with an arabic numeral ( Table 1 , Table 2 , and so on ) and provide a clear title . The label and title should appear on separate lines above the table , flush left and single - spaced . Below the table , give its source in a note . If any data in the table require an explanatory footnote , use a superscript lowercase letter in the body of the table and in a footnote fol - lowing the source note . Double - space source notes and foot - notes and do not indent the first line of each note . See page 42 for an example of a table in a model paper . HAC _ APA . indd 34 10 / 28 / 09 3 : 35 : 36 PM 35 Preparing the list of references For each figure , place a label and a caption below the fig - ure , flush left and double - spaced . The label and caption need not appear on separate lines . In the text of your paper , discuss the most significant fea - tures of each visual . Place the visual as close as possible to the sentences that relate to it unless your instructor prefers it in an appendix . Preparing the list of references Begin your list of references on a new page at the end of the paper . Center the title References one inch from the top of the page . Double - space throughout . For a sample reference list , see page 46 . Indenting entries Use a hanging indent in the reference list : Type the first line of each entry flush left and indent any additional lines one - half inch , as shown on page 46 . Alphabetizing the list Alphabetize the reference list by the last names of the authors ( or editors ) ; when a work has no au - thor or editor , alphabetize by the first word of the title other than A , An , or The . If your list includes two or more works by the same au - thor , arrange the entries by year , the earliest first . If your list includes two or more works by the same author in the same year , arrange the works alphabetically by title . Add the letters “a , ” “b , ” and so on within the parentheses after the year . Use only the year and the letter for articles in journals : ( 2002a ) . Use the full date and the letter for articles in magazines and newspapers in the reference list : ( 2005a , July 7 ) . Use only the year and the letter in the in - text citation . Authors’ names Invert all authors’ names and use initials instead of first names . With two or more authors , use an am - persand ( & ) before the last author’s name . Separate the names with commas . Include names for the first seven authors ; HAC _ APA . indd 35 10 / 28 / 09 3 : 35 : 37 PM 36 APA manuscript format if there are eight or more authors , give the first six authors , three ellipsis dots , and the last author ( see p . 10 ) . Titles of books and articles Italicize the titles and subtitles of books . Do not use quotation marks around the titles of ar - ticles . Capitalize only the first word of the title and subtitle ( and all proper nouns ) of books and articles . Capitalize names of periodicals as you would capitalize them normally . Abbreviations for page numbers Abbreviations for “page” and “pages” ( “p . ” and “pp . ” ) are used before page numbers of newspaper articles and articles in edited books ( see item 9 on p . 12 and item 22 on p . 16 ) but not before page numbers of articles in magazines and scholarly journals ( see items 7 and 8 on p . 12 ) . Breaking a URL When a URL or a DOI ( digital object identi - fier ) must be divided , break it after a double slash or before any other mark of punctuation . Do not insert a hyphen , and do not add a period at the end . For information about the exact format of each entry in your list , consult the models on pages 10 – 32 .

Obesity in Children 2 Abstract In recent years , policymakers and medical experts have expressed alarm about the growing problem of childhood obesity in the United States . While most agree that the issue deserves attention , consensus dissolves around how to respond to the problem . This literature review examines one approach to treating childhood obesity : medication . The paper compares the effectiveness for adolescents of the only two drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for long - term treatment of obesity , sibutramine and orlistat . This examination of pharmacological treatments for obesity points out the limitations of medication and suggests the need for a comprehensive solution that combines medical , social , behavioral , and political approaches to this complex problem .

Surgeon General Richard Carmona called attention to a health problem in the United States that , until recently , has been overlooked : childhood obesity . Carmona said that the “astounding” 15 % child obesity rate constitutes an “epidemic . ” Since the early 1980s , that rate has “doubled in children and tripled in adolescents . ” Now more than nine million children are classified as obese . 1 While the traditional response to a medical epidemic is to hunt for a vaccine or a cure - all pill , childhood obesity has proven more elusive . The lack of success of recent initiatives suggests that medication might not be the answer for the escalating problem . This literature review considers whether the use of medication is a promising approach for solving the childhood obesity problem by responding to the following questions : 1 . What are the implications of childhood obesity ? 2 . Is medication effective at treating childhood obesity ? 3 . Is medication safe for children ? 4 . Is medication the best solution ? Understanding the limitations of medical treatments for children highlights the complexity of the childhood obesity problem in the United States and underscores the need for physicians , advocacy groups , and policymakers to search for other solutions . What Are the Implications of Childhood Obesity ? Obesity can be a devastating problem from both an individual and a societal perspective . Obesity puts children at risk for a number of 1 Obesity is measured in terms of body - mass index ( BMI ) : weight in kilograms divided by square of height in meters . A child or an adolescent with a BMI in the 95th percentile for his or her age and gender is considered obese .

Obesity in Children 4 medical complications , including type 2 diabetes , hypertension , sleep apnea , and orthopedic problems ( Henry J . Kaiser Family Foundation , 2004 , p . 1 ) . Researchers Hoppin and Taveras ( 2004 ) have noted that obesity is often associated with psychological issues such as depression , anxiety , and binge eating ( Table 4 ) . Obesity also poses serious problems for a society struggling to cope with rising health care costs . The cost of treating obesity currently totals $ 117 billion per year—a price , according to the surgeon general , “second only to the cost of [ treating ] tobacco use” ( Carmona , 2004 ) . And as the number of children who suffer from obesity grows , long - term costs will only increase . Is Medication Effective at Treating Childhood Obesity ? The widening scope of the obesity problem has prompted medical professionals to rethink old conceptions of the disorder and its causes . As researchers Yanovski and Yanovski ( 2002 ) have explained , obesity was once considered “either a moral failing or evidence of underlying psychopathology” ( p . 592 ) . But this view has shifted : Many medical professionals now consider obesity a biomedical rather than a moral condition , influenced by both genetic and environmental factors . Yanovski and Yanovski have further noted that the development of weight - loss medications in the early 1990s showed that “obesity should be treated in the same manner as any other chronic disease . . . through the long - term use of medication” ( p . 592 ) . The search for the right long - term medication has been complicated . Many of the drugs authorized by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) in the early 1990s proved to be a disappointment . Two of the medications—fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine—were withdrawn from the market because of severe side effects ( Yanovski & Yanovski , 2002 , p . 592 ) , and several others HAC _ APA . indd 40 10 / 28 / 09 3 : 35 : 44 PM 41 Sample APA research paper Mirano draws attention to an important article . In a parenthetical citation , an ampersand links the names of two authors . Obesity in Children 5 were classified by the Drug Enforcement Administration as having the “potential for abuse” ( Hoppin & Taveras , 2004 , Weight - Loss Drugs section , para . 6 ) . Currently only two medications have been approved by the FDA for long - term treatment of obesity : sibutramine ( marketed as Meridia ) and orlistat ( marketed as Xenical ) . This section compares studies on the effectiveness of each . Sibutramine suppresses appetite by blocking the reuptake of the neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine in the brain ( Yanovski & Yanovski , 2002 , p . 594 ) . Though the drug won FDA approval in 1998 , experiments to test its effectiveness for younger patients came considerably later . In 2003 , University of Pennsylvania researchers Berkowitz , Wadden , Tershakovec , and Cronquist released the first double - blind placebo study testing the effect of sibutramine on adolescents , aged 13 - 17 , over a 12 - month period . Their findings are summarized in Table 1 . After 6 months , the group receiving medication had lost 4 . 6 kg ( about 10 pounds ) more than the control group . But during the second half of the study , when both groups received sibutramine , the results were more ambiguous . In months 6 - 12 , the group that continued to take sibutramine gained an average of 0 . 8 kg , or roughly 2 pounds ; the control group , which switched from placebo to sibutramine , lost 1 . 3 kg , or roughly 3 pounds ( p . 1808 ) . Both groups received behavioral therapy covering diet , exercise , and mental health . These results paint a murky picture of the effectiveness of the medication : While initial data seemed promising , the results after one year raised questions about whether medication - induced weight loss could be sustained over time . As Berkowitz et al . ( 2003 ) advised , “Until more extensive safety and efficacy data are available , . . . weight - loss medications should be used only on an experimental basis for adolescents” ( p . 1811 ) .

Obesity in Children 7 A study testing the effectiveness of orlistat in adolescents showed similarly ambiguous results . The FDA approved orlistat in 1999 but did not authorize it for adolescents until December 2003 . Roche Laboratories ( 2003 ) , maker of orlistat , released results of a one - year study testing the drug on 539 obese adolescents , aged 12 - 16 . The drug , which promotes weight loss by blocking fat absorption in the large intestine , showed some effectiveness in adolescents : an average loss of 1 . 3 kg , or roughly 3 pounds , for subjects taking orlistat for one year , as opposed to an average gain of 0 . 67 kg , or 1 . 5 pounds , for the control group ( pp . 8 - 9 ) . See Table 1 . Short - term studies of orlistat have shown slightly more dramatic results . Researchers at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development tested 20 adolescents , aged 12 - 16 , over a three - month period and found that orlistat , combined with behavioral therapy , produced an average weight loss of 4 . 4 kg , or 9 . 7 pounds ( McDuffie et al . , 2002 , p . 646 ) . The study was not controlled against a placebo group ; therefore , the relative effectiveness of orlistat in this case remains unclear . Is Medication Safe for Children ? While modest weight loss has been documented for both medications , each carries risks of certain side effects . Sibutramine has been observed to increase blood pressure and pulse rate . In 2002 , a consumer group claimed that the medication was related to the deaths of 19 people and filed a petition with the Department of Health and Human Services to ban the medication ( Hilts , 2002 ) . The sibutramine study by Berkowitz et al . ( 2003 ) noted elevated blood pressure as a side effect , and dosages had to be reduced or the medication discontinued in 19 of the 43 subjects in the first six months ( p . 1809 ) . The main side effects associated with orlistat were abdominal discomfort , oily spotting , fecal incontinence , and nausea ( Roche HAC _ APA . indd 43 10 / 28 / 09 3 : 35 : 49 PM 44 Sample APA research paper Mirano develops the paper’s thesis . Obesity in Children 8 Laboratories , 2003 , p . 13 ) . More serious for long - term health is the concern that orlistat , being a fat - blocker , would affect absorption of fat - soluble vitamins , such as vitamin D . However , the study found that this side effect can be minimized or eliminated if patients take vitamin supplements two hours before or after administration of orlistat ( p . 10 ) . With close monitoring of patients taking the medication , many of the risks can be reduced . Is Medication the Best Solution ? The data on the safety and efficacy of pharmacological treatments of childhood obesity raise the question of whether medication is the best solution for the problem . The treatments have clear costs for individual patients , including unpleasant side effects , little information about long - term use , and uncertainty that they will yield significant weight loss . In purely financial terms , the drugs cost more than $ 3 a day on average ( Duenwald , 2004 ) . In each of the clinical trials , use of medication was accompanied by an expensive regime of behavioral therapies , including counseling , nutritional education , fitness advising , and monitoring . As journalist Greg Critser ( 2003 ) noted in his book Fat Land , use of weight - loss drugs is unlikely to have an effect without the proper “support system”—one that includes doctors , facilities , time , and money ( p . 3 ) . For some , this level of care is prohibitively expensive . A third complication is that the studies focused on adolescents aged 12 - 16 , but obesity can begin at a much younger age . Little data exist to establish the safety or efficacy of medication for treating very young children . While the scientific data on the concrete effects of these medications in children remain somewhat unclear , medication is not the only avenue for addressing the crisis .

A quotation longer than forty words is indented without quotation marks . Mirano interprets the evidence ; she doesn’t just report it . The tone of the conclusion is objective . Obesity in Children 9 policymakers recognize that solutions might come not only from a laboratory but also from policy , education , and advocacy . A handbook designed to educate doctors on obesity called for “major changes in some aspects of western culture” ( Hoppin & Taveras , 2004 , Conclusion section , para . 1 ) . Cultural change may not be the typical realm of medical professionals , but the handbook urged doctors to be proactive and “focus [ their ] energy on public policies and interventions” ( Conclusion section , para . 1 ) . The solutions proposed by a number of advocacy groups underscore this interest in political and cultural change . A report by the Henry J . Kaiser Family Foundation ( 2004 ) outlined trends that may have contributed to the childhood obesity crisis , including food advertising for children as well as a reduction in physical education classes and after - school athletic programs , an increase in the availability of sodas and snacks in public schools , the growth in the number of fast - food outlets . . . , and the increasing number of highly processed high - calorie and high - fat grocery products . ( p . 1 ) Addressing each of these areas requires more than a doctor armed with a prescription pad ; it requires a broad mobilization not just of doctors and concerned parents but of educators , food industry executives , advertisers , and media representatives . The barrage of possible approaches to combating childhood obesity—from scientific research to political lobbying—indicates both the severity and the complexity of the problem . While none of the medications currently available is a miracle drug for curing the nation’s 9 million obese children , research has illuminated some of the underlying factors that affect obesity and has shown the need for a comprehensive approach to the problem that includes behavioral , medi - cal , social , and political change .
