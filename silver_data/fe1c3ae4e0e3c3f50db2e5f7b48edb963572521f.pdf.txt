Despite multiple studies in animal models , the 24 subcellular details of the fate of misfolded mutant Rho in rod photoreceptors have not been 25 completely defined . We generated a new mouse model of adRP , in which the P23H - Rho mutant 26 allele is fused to the fluorescent protein Tag - RFP - T ( P23HhRhoRFP ) . In heterozygotes , outer 27 segments formed , and WT rhodopsin was properly localized there , but mutant P23H - Rho 28 protein was specifically mislocalized in the inner segments of rods . Despite this cellular 29 phenotype , the P23HhRhoRFP heterozygous mice exhibited only slowly progressing retinal 30 degeneration ; in ERG recordings , scotopic a - wave amplitudes were reduced by 24 % and 26 % 31 at 30 days and 90 days respectively , and the corresponding scotopic b - waves by 18 % and 24 % . 32 Outer nuclear layer thickness was still 80 % of WT at 90 days , but at 364 days had declined to 33 40 % of WT . Transmission electron microscopy revealed greatly expanded membrane lamellae 34 in the inner segment , and by fluorescence imaging , we determined that the mislocalized 35 P23HhRhoRFP was contained in greatly expanded endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) membranes . 36 TUNEL staining revealed a slow pace of cell death involving chromosomal endonucleolytic 37 degradation . Quantification of mRNA for markers of ER stress and the unfolded protein 38 response revealed little or no increases in levels of messages encoding the proteins BiP , 39 CHOP , ATF6 , XBP1 , PERK , Eif2α and Derlin - 1 , but a decreased level of total Rhodopsin 40 ( mouse + human ) mRNA levels . The decline in the rate of cell death after an initial burst 41 suggests that P23HhRhoRFP mutant rods undergo an adaptative process that prolongs survival 42 despite gross P23HhRhoRFP protein accumulation in the ER . Because of its slowly progressing 43 nature , and easy visualization of the mutant protein , the P23H - Rho - RFP mouse may represent 44 a useful tool for the future study of the pathology and treatment of P23H - Rho and adRP . 45 46 3 Introduction 47 Retinitis pigmentosa ( RP ) is a hereditary disease of photoreceptor neurons of the retina 48 that causes night blindness , retinal degeneration and , eventually , complete blindness . RP 49 accounts for half of the known cases of all inherited retinal disease ( 1 ) , affecting 1 : 4000 in the 50 US ( 2 ) . Rod and cone photoreceptors , the light - sensing cells in the vertebrate retina are 51 polarized neurons with a specialized outer segment ( OS ) sensory cilium . The OS is the site of 52 phototransduction , the pathway initiated by the photopigment rhodopsin ( Rho ) in rods 53 photoreceptors and the cone opsins in cones . 54 Rho is a prototypical G protein - coupled receptor ( GPCR ) that is densely packaged as an 55 integral transmembrane protein into the lipid bilayers of membrane discs that fill the rod OS 56 cilium . Each mouse OS contains ~ 800 discs , and Rho comprises > 90 % of the total membrane 57 protein content in the OS ( 3 , 4 ) . Every day ~ 10 % of the OS membrane mass in mammalian rods 58 is renewed , as the distal OS discs are shed and engulfed by retina pigment epithelium ( RPE ) 59 phagocytosis ( 5 , 6 ) , and new discs are generated at the base of the OS ( 7 , 8 ) . Thus , in each 60 mouse rod photoreceptor ~ 2 . 4 million Rho molecules must be synthesized daily in the inner 61 segment ( IS ) , the biosynthetic compartment of rods , to be delivered to the OS cilium to sustain 62 this renewal ( 3 ) . This trafficking load – including Rho , other visual proteins , and lipids - must 63 pass through a thin , 300 nm connecting cilium ( CC ) bridge located between the IS and OS . The 64 CC has a cylindrical 9 microtubule doublet cytoskeletal core similar to the structure of the 65 transition zone of other primary cilia ( 9 - 11 ) , that extends into the OS and nucleates from a pair 66 of basal body ( BB ) centrioles located at the distal end of the IS in rods . 67 The correct localization of Rho throughout the highly specialized compartments of rods 68 is necessary to satisfy the high trafficking rate of Rho molecules in rods , and maintain 69 homeostasis and cell survival ( 12 ) . Thus , rods are susceptible to genetic mutations to Rho itself , 70 which are the leading cause of autosomal dominant RP ( adRP ) ( 13 ) . One point mutation that 71 4 encodes a proline - to - histidine change at codon 23 ( P23H ) in the N - terminus of Rho is the most 72 common single mutation cause of adRP in North America ( 14 , 15 ) . 73 P23H - Rho is a misfolding mutation that causes mislocalization of P23H - Rho protein in 74 cell culture from the plasma membrane to dense endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) cytoplasmic 75 aggregates ( 16 - 18 ) . The deleterious effect of the P23H - Rho mutation has been extensively 76 studied in rods in a wide range of animal models , where it causes rod cell death and retinal 77 degeneration with different degrees of severity ( e . g . , ( 19 - 21 ) . In transgenic P23H - Rho frog rods , 78 the mutant Xenopus - P23H - Rho protein is specifically retained and mislocalized in the IS ER 79 ( 22 ) , while transgenic bovine - P23H - Rho protein in frog rods caused light - induced vesiculation in 80 the IS ( 23 ) . A zebrafish model expressing mouse - P23H - Rho caused photoreceptor 81 degeneration , abnormal rod OS formation and P23H - Rho protein mislocalization throughout the 82 malformed rods in adult fish retina ( 24 ) . 83 Transgenic and knockin P23H - Rho mouse models have variable retinal degeneration 84 rates that coincide with inconsistent photoreceptor cell phenotypes across models ( 25 - 33 ) . 85 Transgenic P23H - Rho mice generated in a Rho null background have severely dysmorphic 86 rods , in which mutant P23H - Rho is mislocalized in endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) surrounding the 87 nucleus ( 30 ) . In contrast , a knockin mouse model , featuring a mouse - P23H - Rho knockin allele , 88 had dramatic mutant P23H - Rho protein degradation and no detectable ER mislocalization or 89 accumulation phenotype ( 28 ) . Rod degeneration in the P23H - Rho knockin heterozygotes was 90 fairly rapid ( the rod population was reduced by 50 % before P40 ( 34 ) ) but even more severe in 91 homozygotes . Notably , the undegraded P23H - Rho protein in the P23H - Rho knockin rods 92 normally localized to the OS and caused abnormal OS disc formation ( 28 , 34 ) . One challenge 93 for characterizing the fate of misfolded P23H - Rho and testing its effects on different therapeutic 94 approaches , is the difficulty in distinguishing WT rhodopsin from a variant that differs by one 95 amino acid residue . We previously generated a P23H - Rho - GFP fusion knockin mouse to easily 96 visualize the mutant protein in rods , and we observed a gross mislocalization of mutant P23H - 97 5 Rho - GFP in the IS ( 35 ) . Furthermore , we found that the mutant fusion protein was largely 98 degraded ; however , we did not characterize any subcellular phenotypes in single rods on a 99 nanoscopic level in the P23H - Rho - GFP mouse ( 21 ) 100 For a more in - depth characterization we have generated a new P23H - Rho mouse model 101 in order to study mutant P23H - Rho protein localization and dynamics , and to serve as a 102 platform for testing gene - based and other therapies . The latter goal is best achieved with a 103 model that has a relatively slow rate of retinal degeneration in line with the slowly progressive 104 course of human vision loss in adRP , which would permit long - term studies . In addition , a 105 relatively non - perturbing tag greatly benefits the testing of therapeutic interventions and 106 strategies . 107 In this study we introduce a new knockin mouse model of P23H - Rho adRP , in which the 108 mutant P23H - Rho protein is fused to a photostable Tag - RFP - T ( 36 ) fusion tag , which we have 109 used to study the mislocalization of the protein . We have also studied the morphological and 110 functional changes that accompany a slowly progressing retinal degeneration 111 112 Results 113 Generation of the P23H - hRho - RFP knockin mouse 114 We designed a new mouse line in which we introduced into the mouse Rho locus , the 115 human rhodopsin gene ( introns and exons ) encoding both the P23H mutation in the first exon 116 and a fusion to Tag - RFP - T at the C - terminus . Tag - RFP - T is a red fluorescent protein ( excitation 117 maximum = 555 nm , emission maximum = 584 nm ) based on a naturally occurring anemone 118 protein engineered for both bright fluorescence and enhanced photostability ( 36 ) . Notably , Tag - 119 RFP - T fluorescence is compatible with GFP fluorescence for multiplex detection , and it has 120 been used for multiple applications since its design , including as a fluorescent fusion marker 121 ( 37 - 39 ) . 122 6 In addition , we added an additional 1D4 signaling sequence to the carboxy - terminus of 123 the P23H - hRho + Tag - RFP - T fusion allele ( Fig 1A - B ) . Our rationale was that the C - terminal 124 RFP fusion tag in the expressed P23H - hRho - Tag - RFP - T ( hereafter P23HhRhoRFP ) protein 125 may inhibit the endogenous Rho 1D4 sequence leading to artifacts not attributable to the P23H 126 mutation . The additional 1D4 sequence was also shown to be necessary for normal trafficking of 127 transgenic Rho - Dendra fusion protein in Xenopus laevis rods ( 40 ) . 128 The P23H - hRho - TagRFP knock - in mice were generated the same way we previously 129 generated P23H - hRho - GFP knock - in mice ( 35 ) , by gene targeting in the HPRT − embryonic stem 130 ( ES ) cell line AB2 . 2 123 , which was derived from mouse strain 129SvEv , essentially as 131 described previously ( 41 , 42 ) . We introduced the P23H mutation into the targeting vector by 132 site - directed mutagenesis ( QuikChange Ⓡ , Stratagene ) . An ISceI recognition site was 133 engineered into the middle of the first intron in the rhodopsin gene at position 1340 from the 134 start of translation , but it was not used in the experiments described here . The Darwin 135 Transgenic Core Facility , Baylor College of Medicine , electroporated ES cells , selected for 136 HPRT + TK − cells and injected correctly targeted ES cells into blastocysts from albino C57BL / 6 - 137 Tyr c - Brd mice ( 43 ) . Founder mice carrying the HPRT - P23H - hRho - TagRFP allele were crossed to 138 GDF - 9 - iCre mice ( 44 ) to remove the HPRT minigene . P23H - hRho - TagRFP ( hereafter “P23H - 139 RFP” in reference to the knockin allele ) mice were extensively backcrossed to C57BL / 6 mice . 140 We validated that the knockin was successful by sequencing genomic DNA from the knockin 141 mouse . We verified expression of the P23HhRhoRFP fusion by fluorescence microscopy of 142 retinas and by immunoblotting ( Fig . 1 , Fig . 2 ) . 143 We used P23H - RFP / + heterozygous mouse retinas to examine the expression of the 144 mutant fusion protein alongside the WT mouse Rho protein from the wild - type allele ( Fig 1B ) . 145 Both WT mouse Rho protein and the product of the knockin allele were detected in P23H - RFP / + 146 retinal lysates by probing with anti - 1D4 antibody . The P23HhRhoRFP fusion protein was 147 A Human P23H - Rhodopsin - RFP Fusion Gene : 5’ - ctgtacaagacggagacgagccaggtggccccggcc taa L Y K T E T S Q V A P A - C anti - 1D4 ( all Rho ) anti - RFP + / + P 2 3 H - R F P / + 25015010075 50 37 25 20 + / + P 2 3 H - R F P / + + / + P 2 3 H - R F P / + 25015010075 50 37 25 20 anti - ß - Actin Retinallysates : 5037 2520 15 10 75 hRho P23H 1 D 4 Tag - RFP - T - ggtgtggtacgcagc cac ttcgagtacccacagtactac - G V V R S H F E Y P Q Y Y - ggtgtggtacgcagc ccc ttcgagtacccacagtactac - G V V R S P F E Y P Q Y Y 5’ Human WT Rho allele : codon : 23 22 24 26 25 27 29 28 30 18 20 19 21 - tccaag acggagacgagccaggtggccccggcc gcaccggtggctacc atggtg - S K T E T S Q V A P A A P V A T M V 1 D 4 5’ Human P23H - Rho allele : B Figure 1 .

( B ) A map of the knock - in human P23H - rhodopsin - RFP fusion gene . A portion of the sequence of exon 1 from the P23H - Rho allele in the fusion gene ( blue ) is aligned to the same human wild - type ( WT ) Rho allele sequence ( black ) . The mutated codon 23 is in bold font . The transition sequence from the 1D4 terminal signal sequence to the Tag - RFP - T with a short linker sequence is shown in the middle sequence panel and the C - terminal sequence with the extra 1D4 epitope sequence appended to the end Tag - RFP - T prior to the stop codon . ( C ) Western blot confirmation of the P23HhRhoRFP fusion protein expression in P23H - RFP / + heterozygous retinas . Retinal lysates are from a wild - type ( + / + ) mouse , age P22 , and a P23H - RFP / + mouse , age 45 ; 100 µg of total protein from each lysate was loaded onto SDS - PAGE gels . Blot membranes were probed with either of the following antibodies : anti - 1D4 , anti - RFP or anti - beta ( ß ) - actin ( a loading control ) . Blot scans for the protein ladder were used to mark molecular weight sizes ( in kilodaltons , kDa ) on the left of each blot image . The ~ 65 kDa P23HhRhoRFP fusion protein band is present in the P23H - RFP / + lane in both anti - 1D4 and anti - RFP blot scans ( magenta arrows ) . The monomeric mouse Rho protein band is in both lanes in the anti - 1D4 blot scan ( black arrow ) . Higher MW species are formed by rhodopsin multimerization . 8 detected as a strong ~ 65 kDa band specifically in P23H - RFP / + lysates using both anti - 1D4 and 148 anti - RFP antibodies , verifying robust expression . 149 150 P23HhRhoRFP protein was mislocalized in rod photoreceptor neurons . 151 We next tested the fluorescence pattern of the P23HhRhoRFP fusion protein in the 152 retinas of both P23H - RFP / + heterozygous and P23H - RFP / P23H - RFP homozygous mice . The 153 RFP fluorescence is evident in the outer photoreceptor layers of retinal sections from both 154 heterozygotes and homozygotes at age P30 ( Fig 2A ) . In a confocal z - projection of a retinal 155 section from a P30 P23H - RFP / + heterozygote , P23HhRhoRFP is most prominently located in 156 brightly fluorescent puncta or “aggregates” within the regions of the inner segments and outer 157 segments of photoreceptors ( Fig 2B ) . Less prominent but visible in this same section is P23H - 158 Rho - RFP fluorescence at the photoreceptor synapses of the outer plexiform layer ( OPL ) and in 159 the cytoplasm surrounding the photoreceptor nuclei of the outer nuclear layer ( ONL ) ( Fig 2B ) . 160 Compared to both WT and heterozygotes , the ONL of P30 homozygotes was noticeably thinner 161 based on DAPI + nuclei staining ( Fig 2C ) . P23HhRhoRFP aggregates were also clearly visible in 162 the ONL of the homozygous retina . 163 We crossed our new P23H - RFP mouse line with wild - type hRho - GFP mouse lines for 164 dual fluorescent tag multiplex imaging . This approach allowed us to investigate the subcellular 165 dynamics of the mutant P23HhRhoRFP protein relative to hRho - GFP without the P23H 166 mutation . In addition to the hRho - GFP fusion mouse that we previously reported ( 41 ) , we also 167 generated a new line with an additional 1D4 signal sequence added to the end of the EGFP 168 sequence ( “hRho - GFP - 1D4” ) . As heterozygotes , we could not discriminate any phenotypic 169 difference between these GFP fusion mice . 170 Both GFP fusion lines were crossed to our new P23H - RFP knockin mouse . In confocal 171 images of retinal sections from an adult hRho - GFP - 1D4 / P23H - RFP heterozygote we observed 172 a drastic localization difference between hRho - GFP - 1D4 , which correctly populated the rod 173 B SIM OS A C Retinal Sections , Age P30 : + / + P23H - RFP / + P23H - RFP / P23H - RFP DAPIRFP P23H - RFP / + , Age P30 P23H - RFP / P23H - RFP , Age P30 DAPI RFP DAPI RFP RFP ( bright ) O N L Genotype : IS / OS O P L O N L I N L 20 μm 20 μm 0 . 2 mm 0 . 2 mm 0 . 2 mm 20 μm 20 μm 20 μm ONL ONL ONL Figure 2 .

( A ) Widefield fluorescence images of mouse retinal cryosections from age - matched P30 wild - type ( + / + ) , heterozygous ( P23H - RFP / + ) and homozygous knockin mice ( P23H - RFP / P23H - RFP ) . Sections were counterstained with DAPI to label nuclei in the retina ( blue ) . RFP fluorescence from the mutant P23HhRhoRFP fusion protein is shown in magenta . Magnified regions from each section are insets , and the outer nuclear layer ( ONL ) of each retina , which is the location of the DAPI + photoreceptor nuclei , is demarcated . ( B ) Confocal z - projection image of a retinal cryosection from a P30 heterozygous P23H - RFP / + mouse . The brightest RFP signal is in the outer photoreceptor layers , the inner segment and outer segment region ( IS / OS ) , where P23HhRhoRFP protein is localized in aggregates . In the same image , with the gain of the RFP signal raised to saturation , additional P23HhRhoRFP protein is observed in the rod photoreceptor synapses within the outer plexiform layer ( yellow arrows ) . To a lesser degree , P23HhRhoRFP is also localized in the ONL , in the cytoplasm surrounding the photoreceptor nuclei ( white arrows ) . ( C ) Confocal z - projection through a retinal cryosection from a P30 P23H - RFP / P23H - RFP homozygote . The width of the DAPI - positive ONL is thinner compared to the heterozygote . In the homozygous retina , mutant P23HhRhoRFP fusion protein is also more prominently localized in the ONL compared to the heterozygote . INL = inner nuclear layer . 10 photoreceptor OS cilia , and the P23HhRhoRFP aggregates , which were prominently 174 mislocalized in the rod inner segment layer ( Fig 3A ) . We examined retinal sections from this 175 same hRho - GFP - 1D4 / P23H - RFP heterozygous mouse line with structured illumination 176 microscopy ( SIM ) superresolution imaging and observed a clear segregation of P23HhRhoRFP 177 from the hRho - GFP - 1D4 in the OS cilia ( Fig 3B ) . Interestingly , in retinal sections from the other 178 heterozygous hRho - GFP / P23H - RFP mice , we found evidence of hRho - GFP mislocalization in 179 the same region as the P23HhRhoRFP aggregates in what appear to be distinct but interwoven 180 membrane compartments ( Fig 3C ) . This result suggests that the added C - terminal 1D4 181 sequence prevents hRho - GFP from being mislocalized with P23HhRhoRFP in the GFP / RFP 182 heterozygous animals . 183 To visualize the location of the P23HhRhoRFP inner segment aggregates relative to the 184 connecting cilium ( CC ) and basal body ( BB ) we used centrin as an antibody marker for the CC 185 and BB ( 45 , 46 ) in retinal sections from P23H - RFP / + mice and imaged by SIM . At age P14 , we 186 found many examples of P23HhRhoRFP aggregates that were located just proximal to the BB 187 ( Fig 4A ) . We observed this same sub - BB localization of the RFP aggregates in retinal sections 188 from age P30 P23H - RFP / + mice ( Fig 4B ) , with some examples of P23HhRhoRFP fluorescence 189 overlapping into the BB region . In retinas from both ages , the RFP fluorescence pattern within 190 these P23HhRhoRFP clumps was discontinuous with dark patches . Morphologically , the 191 P23HhRhoRFP fluorescent aggregates in P14 retina had a compact and defined elliptical shape 192 compared to the aggregates in the P30 retina which appeared more elongated and less 193 structured . 194 Taken together , fluorescence images of P23H - RFP retinas at different ages demonstrate 195 that the P23HhRhoRFP mutant fusion protein was excluded from the OS and mislocalized 196 within aggregates near the BB in the IS and to a lesser degree in the ONL and the 197 photoreceptor synapses . This result suggests that the mutant fusion protein is accumulating in a 198 199 mouse : hRho - GFP - 1D4 / P23H - RFP , age 3 weeks ONL IS OS mouse : hRho - GFP - 1D4 / P23H - RFP , age 6 weeks SIM 5 μ m OS IS SIM 5 μ m OS IS A B mouse : hRho - GFP / P23H - RFP , age P30 C 5 μ m 5 μ m 1 μ m 1 μ m GFP RFPDAPI 10 μ m SIM SIM OS GFPRFP GFPRFP Figure 3 . P23HhRhoRFP + fusion aggregates are localized in the inner segments of rod photoreceptor neurons . ( A ) In a confocal z - projection image of a retinal section from the hRho - GFP - 1D4 / P23H - RFP heterozygous mouse retina , at 3 weeks of age , the wild - type hRho - GFP fusion ( green ) , which has an additional C - terminal 1D4 signal sequence , is correctly localized to the outer segments ( OS ) of rod neurons . In this retina , RFP + aggregates containing mutant P23HhRhoRFP protein ( magenta ) are primarily located in the inner segments ( IS ) of rods and almost entirely segregated from the GFP + OS layer . White dotted lines in the figure demarcate the OS / IS boundary and the IS / outer nuclear layer ( ONL ) boundary . ( B ) In SIM micrographs of retinal sections from the same heterozygous mouse line at age 6 weeks , GFP + OS and RFP + IS aggregates remain segregated with no apparent co - localization . ( C ) In SIM images of retinal sections from an alternate GFP / RFP heterozygote at age P30 , in which the wild - type hRho - GFP fusion does not have an additional 1D4 signal peptide , the GFP fluorescence is not exclusively located in the OS layer , but rather is partially mislocalized with P23H - hRho - RFP . In a magnified example , hRho - GFP is co - localized around and within a P23HhRhoRFP aggregate ( yellow arrows ) . In another magnified example , hRho - GFP is wrapped around an P23HhRhoRFP aggregate ( white arrow ) . centrin RFP 5 μm 500 nm CC mouse : P23H - RFP / + , age : P14 A mouse : P23H - RFP / + , age : P30 B 5 μm 500 nm BB Figure 4 .

( A ) In a SIM z - projection image of a retinal section from the P23H - RFP / + mouse at age P14 , centrin immunolabeling ( green ) marks the location of rod connecting cilium ( CC ) and basal body ( BB ) relative to the P23HhRhoRFP fluorescent aggregates ( magenta ) . In magnified views , single RFP + inner segment aggregates are located just proximal to the CC ( yellow arrow ) and BB ( white stars ) . The BB region is demarcated by the centrin + mother centriole at the proximal end of the CC and the daughter centriole , which is a separated centrin + puncta beneath the mother centriole . ( B ) A SIM image of a retinal section from the P23H - RFP / + mouse at age P30 also with centrin immunolabeling . In magnified views , the RFP + aggregates at P30 are still generally located proximal to the BB ( white stars ) , with some examples of RFP overlapping with the BB region . The organization of the RFP + aggregates in these P30 rods are less compact and more reticulated compared to the examples from age P14 ( see examples in A ) . 13 trafficking stage just prior to the BB and integration into the cilia , and thus it fails to be properly 202 transported to the OS . 203 204 P23H - RFP / + mice have mild and gradual retinal degeneration . 205 Next , we tested the effect of the mutant P23HhRhoRFP fusion on retinal health by 206 measuring the rates of retinal degeneration in both P23H - RFP / + heterozygous and P23H - 207 RFP / P23H - RFP homozygous mice . We measured the thickness of the ONL , in which the 208 photoreceptor nuclei were stained for 4′ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ) fluorescence , in 209 retinal sections from both genotypes and in wild - type ( + / + ) control retinas from mice at multiple 210 timepoints . Overall , the P23H - RFP / + heterozygous retinas degenerated more slowly over time 211 compared to the homozygous retinas as measured by ONL thickness ( Fig 5A - B ) . Our analysis 212 covered the full retina – peripheral to central – to test for any region - specific degeneration 213 caused by the mutant P23HhRhoRFP fusion protein . 214 At postnatal day 14 ( P14 ) there is no difference in the ONL thickness in the retinas 215 among any of the phenotypes , indicating that the retinas develop normally in the P23H - RFP 216 heterozygous and homozygous mutants ( Fig 5A - E ) . Thereafter , the width of the ONL in the 217 heterozygous retinas declined slowly , approaching a final value of 23 μm with a time constant of 218 56 days , while the ONL in the homozygous mutants declined much more rapidly , with a time 219 constant of 12 days . By age P90 the ONL in P23H - RFP / P23H - RFP homozygous retinas was 220 reduced to a single , disorganized layer of nuclei ( See Fig 5A , 5E , & Fig 5G ) . 221 Although the ONL thickness in P23H - RFP / + heterozygous retinas were significantly 222 reduced in the inferior retina at P60 and P90 ( Fig 5B & 5G ) , the thickness across all regions of 223 the retina in P23H - RFP / + mutants was not significantly different from that of + / + retinas at age 224 P90 ( Fig 5G ) . Notably , compared to P14 P23H - RFP / + measurements , the P90 P23H - RFP / + 225 ONL thickness was significantly reduced ( Fig 5D ) . By age P364 it was evident that the ONL had 226 been severely reduced in P23H - RFP heterozygous retinas due to nuclei loss ( Fig 5B , see 227 A P14 P30 P90 P364 + / + P 23 H - R F P / + P 23 H - R F P / P 23 H - R F P 50 µ m C - 2000 - 1000 0 1000 2000 0 20 40 60 80 + / + Distance from optic nerve ( μ m ) O N L t h i ck n ess ( μ m ) inferior superior P14 ( n = 5 ) P30 ( n = 3 ) P90 ( n = 3 ) - 2000 - 1000 0 1000 2000 0 20 40 60 80 P23H - RFP / + inferior superior P14 ( n = 4 ) P30 ( n = 8 ) P90 ( n = 3 ) Distance from optic nerve ( μ m ) - 2000 - 1000 0 1000 2000 0 20 40 60 80 P23H - RFP / P23H - RFP inf sup P14 ( n = 4 ) P30 ( n = 3 ) P90 ( n = 3 ) Distance from optic nerve ( μ m ) ONL - 2000 - 1000 0 1000 2000 0 20 40 60 80 P30 inferior superior P23H / + ( n = 8 ) P23H / P23H ( n = 3 ) WT ( n = 3 ) O N L t h i ck n ess ( μ m ) Distance from optic nerve ( μ m ) - 2000 - 1000 0 1000 2000 0 20 40 60 80 inf sup P90 O N L t h i ck n ess ( μ m ) Distance from optic nerve ( μ m ) P23H / + ( n = 8 ) P23H / P23H ( n = 3 ) WT ( n = 3 ) D E F G * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * INL I N L B + / + P23H - RFP / + P23H - RFP / P23H - RFP Age ( Postnatal Days ) 00 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 16 Figure 5 . Time course of retinal degeneration in P23H - RFP / + heterozygous and P23H - RFP / + homozygous mice . ( A ) Confocal z - projection images of retinal cryosections from wild - type ( + / + ) , and P23H - RFP heterozygote ( het ) and P23H - RFP / P23H - RFP homozygous ( homo ) mice at various time points . DAPI ( blue ) labels photoreceptor nuclei in the outer nuclear layer ( ONL ) and the bipolar cell nuclei in the inner nuclear layer ( INL ) . RFP fluorescence ( magenta ) is primarily located in the inner segment layers of het retinas at all time points , while RFP is also located in the ONL in homo retinas . At P90 , the homo ONL is reduced to very few disorganized nuclei surrounded by RFP . ( B ) Time course plot of ONL thickness between genotypes . Measurements correspond to the ONL thickness of the retina 500 µm inferior to the optic nerve . Unfilled shapes correspond to the mean value , and error bars signify standard error of the mean . Solid lines represent fits to exponential decays to plateau , as described in Methods . Unpaired t - tests were calculated to compare + / + and het values for significance .

We found generally that ERG waveforms at age P30 236 correlated to our retinal degeneration phenotypes between the mutant P23H - RFP genotypes 237 compared to + / + control mice ( Fig 6A ) . In dark - adapted conditions , the scotopic a - wave 238 amplitudes in P23H - RFP / + mice were significantly reduced compared to + / + mice at P30 ( Fig 239 6B ) ; however , the a - waves stabilized over time and were not further diminished in P23H - RFP / + 240 mutants at age P90 compared to P30 ( Fig 6C ) . Scotopic b - wave values were not significantly 241 reduced in P30 P23H - RFP / + mice compared to + / + ( Fig 6D ) , and like the a - wave , the b - wave 242 values were not diminished in age P90 P23H / + mice compared to P30 ( Fig 6E ) . We also 243 measured the implicit times from scotopic ERG recordings , which are times from the a - wave 244 deflection to peak b - wave . In P30 P23H - RFP / + mice compared to + / + mice , implicit times were 245 higher at moderate flash intensities , but there was not a significant difference over the entire 246 flash range ( Fig 6F ) . 247 P23H - RFP / P23H - RFP homozygous mice have essentially no scotopic ERG response 248 ( Fig 6A - B and 6D ) . The minor b - wave response at high flash intensities in homozygotes could 249 be attributed to cones . We also measured the cone ERG response in light - adapted mice from all 250 genotypes at P30 . Photopic b - wave amplitudes were recorded in both P23H - RFP / + and P23H - 251 RFP / P23H - RFP mice , and although they appeared slightly lower in amplitude , they were not 252 significantly reduced compared to + / + mice ( Fig 6G ) . 253 To determine whether there were any visible alterations of cone morphology in the 254 mutants , we used cone arrestin immunofluorescence labeling in our P23H - RFP mice at P30 . 255 17 Cones populated the retinas of P23H - RFP / + heterozygotes as well as in the retinas of P23H - 256 RFP / P23H - RFP homozygotes despite the massive loss of photoreceptor nuclei in the 257 homozygotes ( Fig 7A ) . At P90 we still observed cones in P23H - RFP / + heterozygotes , but in 258 P90 homozygotes there were no visible cones remaining , presumably as a result of the nearly 259 complete loss of rods ( Fig 7B ) . 260 To determine the rate of cell death in our P23H - RFP mice , we used terminal 261 deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling ( TUNEL ) fluorescence . We observed 262 TUNEL + photoreceptor nuclei in the ONL of retinal sections from both P23H - RFP / + and P23H - 263 RFP / P23H - RFP mice ( Fig 7C ) . We measured the number of TUNEL + nuclei per mm 2 area of 264 the ONL at multiple timepoints . At P14 , the number of TUNEL + nuclei in P23H - RFP / + 265 heterozygous retinal sections were comparable to + / + sections , while the rate was significantly 266 greater in homozygous retinal sections at P14 ( Fig 7D ) . By age P30 , the number of TUNEL + 267 nuclei was significantly greater in P23H - RFP / + retina compared to + / + ( Fig 7D ) ; however , at age 268 P90 the TUNEL + density in heterozygotes was no longer significantly different from that in + / + 269 mice ( Fig 7D ) . 270 Overall , we observed that P23H - RFP / + heterozygous mice have a slow and partial 271 retinal degeneration and mild loss of rod ERG function . At age P90 the heterozygous retinas 272 were still comparable in overall health to control + / + retinas despite the gross mis - accumulation 273 of P23HhRhoRFP protein in the rod inner segments . The rate of photoreceptor cell death in 274 P23H - RFP / + retinas indicates that a moderate burst of degeneration begins after P14 , which 275 has slowed by age P90 . By comparison , the retinal degeneration and ERG phenotypes in 276 homozygous P23H - RFP / P23H - RFP mice were much more severe , such that at P90 , nearly all 277 photoreceptor neurons were lost in the retinas of homozygotes . 278 279 280 A - 0 . 6 - 1 . 6 - 2 . 6 - 3 . 6 + / + , P30 P23H - RFP / + , P30 P23H - RFP / P23H - RFP , P30 Flash Energy 50 ms 200 μ V B - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 0 0 100 200 Scotopic a - wave Flash Intensity ( log [ cd * s / m² ] ) A m p li t ude ( μ V ) P30 + / + ( n = 5 ) P30 P23H het ( n = 4 ) P30 P23H homo ( n = 3 ) P30 P23H het ( n = 4 ) P90 P23H het ( n = 3 ) Scotopic a - wave Flash Intensity ( log [ cd * s / m² ] ) C - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 0 0 100 200 A m p li t ude ( μ V ) - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 0 0 200 400 600 Scotopic b - wave P30 + / + ( n = 5 ) P30 P23H het ( n = 4 ) P30 P23H homo ( n = 3 ) D Flash Intensity ( log [ cd * s / m² ] ) A m p li t ude ( μ V ) - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 0 0 200 400 600 P30 P23H het ( n = 4 ) P90 P23H het ( n = 3 ) A m p li t ude ( μ V ) Flash Intensity ( log [ cd * s / m² ] ) Scotopic b - wave E - 0 . 5 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 0 100 200 Photopic b - wave P30 + / + ( n = 5 ) P30 P23H het ( n = 3 ) P30 P23H homo ( n = 3 ) Flash Intensity ( log [ cd * s / m² ] ) A m p li t ude ( μ V ) - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 0 50 100 150 Implicit Time I m p li c i t T i m e ( m s ) P30 + / + ( n = 5 ) P30 P23H het ( n = 4 ) Flash Intensity ( log [ cd * s / m² ] ) * * * * * * * * * * * * F G Figure 6 .

Genes whose messages we 289 quantified included those encoding BiP , CHOP , ATF6 , Eif2α , PERK , DRL1 and XBP1 . None 290 showed a statistically significant increase relative to both “housekeeping” genes ( Fig . 8 ) . We 291 also quantified levels of mRNA transcribed from the Rhodopsin locus , using primer pairs that 292 either amplified both human and mouse alleles ( mhRho ) , or the mouse allele only ( mRho ) . Both 293 showed a decrease in message levels in the retinas of heterozygotes relative to those in the 294 WT . The mouse - specific message would be expected to be reduced by ~ 50 % , based strictly on 295 copy number ; however , the reduction was about 70 % , whereas the total message derived from 296 both alleles was down about 35 % suggesting a down - regulation of both Rho mRNAs by 35 % 297 relative to WT through either reduced transcription or increased degradation , possibly in 298 response to the presence of aggregated protein . 299 300 P23HhRhoRFP protein was mis - accumulated in the inner segment endoplasmic reticulum . 301 To understand how the mutant P23HhRhoRFP protein is handled by the P23H - RFP / + 302 rods , we examined the subcellular structures by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) of 303 ultra - thin retina sections following a tannic acid based staining procedure that densely stains 304 internal membranes ( 8 ) . At age P14 , in P23H - RFP / + heterozygous rods , we observed distinct 305 membranous accumulations in the IS that matched the shape and morphology of the 306 fluorescent RFP + aggregates ( Fig . 9A - B ) . Compared to + / + rods , where cytoplasmic 307 membranes are mostly observed in the proximal IS , the membranous accumulations in 308 heterozygous rods were primarily in the form of semi - organized stacks of folded membranes in 309 20 the distal IS . These membranes often filled the mutant IS cytoplasm , apparently distending the 310 width of the IS itself . Indeed , we measured the average maximum IS width of P14 P23H - RFP / + 311 rods to be significantly greater compared to the WT average maximum width ( Fig 9 , see 312 legend ) . Despite these large aberrant IS membranes in P23H - RFP / + rods , the morphologies of 313 the BB , CC and OS discs were relatively normal and indistinguishable between P23H - RFP / + 314 315 2 . 5 2 . 0 1 . 5 . 5 - 1 . 0 - 1 . - 2 .

With TEM , in age P30 P23H - RFP / + rods , we also observed accumulated IS 322 membranes ; however , they did indeed appear more dysmorphic than those at P14 , with 323 examples of the membranes wrapping around themselves in whorls ( Fig 9C , magenta arrows ) . 324 As in P14 P23H - RFP / + retinal sections , the aberrant rod IS membranes at P30 were located 325 among normally formed OS disc stacks , and the CC and BB structures were also 326 morphologically normal at P30 ( Fig 9D ) . Unlike P14 rods , however , we observed some defects 327 in OS membrane morphology at the base of the OS in some P30 P23H - RFP / + rods . These 328 defects included vesicular and misshapen discs , and an unbound , splayed OS axoneme ( Fig 329 9C - D , green arrows ) . The results indicate that the mutant P23H - Rho - RFP leads to massive 330 alterations of inner segment membrane structure , accompanied by a least partial disruption of 331 outer segment morphology . 332 To determine the nature of the membranes in which the RFP fusion protein is located , 333 we used immunofluorescence with antibodies for the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) antigens 334 BiP / GRP78 ( binding immunoglobulin protein / glucose - regulated protein 78 , an ER lumen 335 chaperone protein ) and KDEL ( an ER - specific tetrapeptide folding tag ) , and for the Golgi 336 antigen GM130 ( a Golgi - specific membrane marker ) . In confocal z - projections , we found that 337 BiP ER immunolabeling was co - localized with the RFP + IS aggregates in rod cells from P14 338 P23H - RFP / + retinal sections ( Fig 10A ) . Compared to + / + BiP labeling , which was largely 339 located in the proximal IS , BiP staining in the mutant P23H - RFP / + retina was extended into the 340 distal IS and colocalized with the RFP + aggregates . This result demonstrates that the 341 membrane stacks we observed in the IS of mutant rod via TEM are greatly expanded ER 342 membranes .

( A - B ) Conventional transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) images of rod photoreceptor neurons at age P14 from either ( A ) + / + or ( B ) P23H - RFP / + heterozygous ( het ) mice . In each example rod , the inner segment ( IS ) is outlined with yellow lines . The IS max width in P14 P23H - RFP / + rods is significantly greater than + / + rods ( het : 2 . 967 µm ± 0 . 508 µm ( standard deviation , sd ) ( n = 14 ) vs + / + : 1 . 974 ± 0 . 481 µm ( sd ) ( n = 19 ) , P < 0 . 0001 , unpaired t - test ) . Ectopic stacks of IS membranes in the swollen P23H - RFP / + IS are marked with magenta arrows . Double - membraned autophagy compartments are marked with magenta asterisks in the mutant P23H - RFP / + IS . In magnified views of example connecting cilia ( CC ) from each genotype , the length of the CC – measured by the densely stained CC membrane – is indicated . In aggregate , the length of the CC in P23H - RFP / + rods is significantly greater than + / + CC ( het : 1 . 548 µm ± 0 . 206 µm ( sd ) ( n = 13 ) vs + / + : 1 . 27 µm ± 0 . 247 µm ( sd ) ( n = 11 ) , P = 0 . 0066 , unpaired t - test ) . ( C ) At age P30 , the ectopic IS membranes in P23H / + rods appear more dysmorphic compared to P14 ( magenta arrows ) . In addition , some outer segments disc membranes within or adjacent to P23H - RFP / + rods with IS defects are also disrupted and appear dysmorphic ( green arrows ) . ( D ) In examples of the CC and basal OS regions of P30 P23H / + rods , the structure of the CC and basal body remain intact despite being adjacent to ectopic IS membranes ( magenta arrows ) ; however , there is evidence that basal OS disc morphogenesis is disrupted possibly due to OS axoneme instability ( green arrows ) . 25 network was unaffected in P14 P23H - RFP / + retinas and was not co - localized with RFP + 348 aggregates ( Fig 10B ) . 349 We used SIM superresolution microscopy to examine the morphology of the ER and 350 Golgi more closely in individual rods in P23H - RFP / + heterozygous and + / + retinas at P30 . We 351 added centrin immunolabeling to label the CC and BB in these SIM experiments . In P30 P23H - 352 RFP / + retinas , we again observed BiP co - localization with RFP aggregates in the IS ( Fig 10 B - 353 C , white arrows ) . The BiP + ER lumen surrounded and was intercalated with the mislocalized 354 P23HhRhoRFP protein that appeared aggregated within the ER membranes . We also observed 355 BiP + ER in other regions of the IS including at the BB ( Fig 10 B - C , yellow arrows ) . In control 356 wild - type ( + / + ) P30 retinas , the BiP - positive ER is located throughout the IS in a reticulated 357 morphology that extends to the BB as well ( Fig 10E ) . We observed similar KDEL + ER 358 localization in P30 P23H / + rods : both co - localized within RFP + aggregates ( Fig 10F , white 359 arrows ) and in the BB region ( Fig 10F , yellow arrows ) ; however , KDEL labeling was more 360 punctate than BiP labeling . In P30 + / + rods , KDEL was also localized throughout the IS and in 361 the BB region ( Fig 10G ) . Although there is much evidence of co - localization of RFP and ER 362 marker signal , the ER markers are not uniformly distributed throughout the clumps of RFP 363 signal , and there are large sections of RFP - positive aggregates without ER marker signal . 364 We also used SIM to examine the morphology of GM130 + Golgi in P30 P23H - RFP / + 365 rods . As before we observed the Golgi in the proximal IS of P23H - RFP / + retinas and 366 segregated from the RFP + aggregates and the centrin + CC / BB . In some mutant heterozygous 367 rod IS , however , we observed smaller GM130 + Golgi membranes within the RFP + aggregates 368 ( Fig 10H , white arrows ) . Also , we found some examples of P30 P23H - RFP / + rods with more 369 elaborate Golgi that extended into the distal IS and nearby RFP + aggregates ( Fig 10H , yellow 370 arrows ) . In SIM images of P30 + / + retina immunolabeled for GM130 and centrin , we found most 371 of the Golgi in the proximal IS and dissociated from the centrin + cilium .

P23HhRhoRFP fluorescence is magenta . Co - localized BiP with RFP + aggregates in the P14 P23H - RFP / + retina section is marked with white arrows . GM130 + Golgi membranes do not co - localize with RFP + aggregates and appear unaffected in the P14 P23H - RFP / + retina compared to + / + sections .

KDEL puncta are more diffuse than BiP , but the localization pattern in the IS is similar ; KDEL co - localization with the P23H - RFP aggregates ( white arrows ) and KDEL + ER near the basal body that is not associated with RFP ( yellow arrows ) are labeled .

( H ) SIM images of a P23H - RFP / + retina cryosection at age P30 immunolabeled for GM130 , a Golgi membrane marker ( green ) , along with centrin ( white ) and RFP ( magenta ) . Overall , The Golgi is proximally localized to the RFP + aggregates at P30 , but in some examples the Golgi network reaches the centrin + cilium . On a subcellular scale , the Golgi membranes are generally segregated from RFP aggregates ( yellow arrows ) , but small pieces of Golgi membrane are found co - localized with some RFP aggregates ( white arrows ) . ( I ) In age P30 + / + SIM control images of retinal cryosections , the Golgi is predominantly dissociated from the cilia ; however , examples of + / + rods with GM130 + Golgi membrane networks that reach the basal body are shown . Gray dotted arrows throughout mark a region that is magnified from the same image . 27 we did observe some examples of + / + rods in which the Golgi network was more elaborate and 377 extended up to the BB ( Fig 10I ) . 378 Finally , in our SIM images we observed both BiP + and KDEL + ER localized with the 379 mislocalized P23HhRhoRFP protein in the region of rod synapses in the OPL ( outer plexiform 380 layer ) of P30 P23H - RFP / + retinas ( Fig 11A - B ) .

P23HRhoRFP protein ( magenta ) fills the rod photoreceptor synapses in this region . BiP + ER labeling is present throughout the OPL and the outer nuclear layer ( ONL ) . In a magnified view of a pair of synapses , P23HhRhoRFP protein is co - localized with the BiP + ER staining . ( B ) In a similar SIM magnified view of a P30 P23H - RFP / + retina section immunostained for KDEL ( green ) , P23HRhoRFP protein is also co - localized with KDEL + ER staining . ( C ) As a control SIM image , a P30 P23H - RFP / + retina section is immunostained for GM130 to label Golgi . No Golgi membranes are evident in the OPL ; however , they are present in the inner nuclear layer ( INL ) . 29 386 Discussion 387 The P23HhRhoRFP mouse we introduce here is a potentially useful animal model for 388 adRP that can reveal the subcellular and molecular pathology of the misfolding P23H - Rho 389 mutation on the long - term health of mammalian rod neurons . Tag - RFP - T fluorescence in these 390 mice enables both gross and nanoscopic analysis of P23H - Rho ER accumulation in vivo . The 391 WT - hRho - GFP / P23HhRhoRFP dual color heterozygote demonstrates the different ways the cell 392 processes these two proteins with similar fusions , but with and without the P23H rhodopsin 393 mutation ( Fig 3 ) . WT - Rho - GFP fusion protein is restricted almost exclusively to the OS in rods 394 of the Rho - GFP heterozygotes ( 52 ) , whereas the same fusion construct with a P23H mutation 395 was largely confined to the inner segment and ONL ( 35 ) , as observed in the new model 396 reported here , consistent with the notion that the P23H mutation is responsible for the disruption 397 in normal trafficking , likely as a result of misfolding ( 18 ) . Furthermore , with superresolution 398 microscopy , we observed P23HhRhoRFP localization proximal to the connecting cilium and 399 basal body in P23H - RFP / + heterozygous rods and completely excluded from the OS ( Figs 2 - 3 ) . 400 The exclusive IS mislocalization of the P23H - Rho - RFP protein is unlike P23H - Rho localization 401 in other mouse models , in which there is some detectable OS transport despite other 402 mislocalization and degradation phenotypes ( 25 , 27 , 31 , 34 ) . 403 While both P23H - RFP / + heterozygous and homozygous retinas had mislocalization of 404 P23H - Rho to the IS , rod neuron degeneration in the homozygotes was more severe . In the 405 heterozygotes , despite dramatic P23H - Rho mislocalization and a burst of rod cell death around 406 age P30 , the progression of degeneration in P23H - RFP / + retinas was only partial and relatively 407 slow . By comparison , in the “untagged” P23H - Rho knockin mouse line , heterozygotes lose 43 % 408 of their rod population relative to WT by P63 ( 28 ) ; we do not observe such a severe reduction 409 until age P120 ( Fig 5B ) . 410 30 The stability of the P23H - RFP / + heterozygous rods over time enables long term studies 411 in these mice and suggests an adaptation in these rods that provides a neuroprotective effect 412 despite the ER accumulation of P23H - Rho protein . This effect may be related to an ER stress 413 adaptation like the unfolded protein response ( UPR ) , which was originally characterized based 414 on an increase in BiP / GrP78 and C / EBO protein ( Chop ) mRNA levels - indicators of an 415 activation of the pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum kinase - like endoplasmic reticulum kinase 416 ( PERK ) UPR pathway - in transgenic P23H - Rho rats ( 53 ) . Also in P23H - Rho transgenic rats , 417 overexpression of BiP / Grp78 preserved ERG rod function ( 54 ) , and overexpression of the BiP - 418 binding ER chaperone ERdj5 preserved photoreceptor survival ( 55 ) . Although we found no 419 evidence for up - regulation of BiP CHOP or PERK at the mRNA level at P30 in P23H - RFP / + 420 retinas ( Fig . 8 ) , we did not measure corresponding protein levels , or mRNA levels at later ages . 421 We did observe widespread BiP / Grp78 protein in the ER throughout the rod cytoplasm , which 422 co - localized with the ER - accumulated P23H - Rho - RFP protein ( Fig . 9 ) . 423 In contrast , in the untagged P23H - Rho knockin mouse , the inositol - requiring enzyme 1 424 ( IRE1 ) UPR pathway was shown to be activated concurrent with increased ER - associated 425 protein degradation ( ERAD ) activity , whereas the PERK pathway was not activated in this 426 model ( 56 ) . Another study supported a key role for protein degradation by demonstrating that 427 P23H - Rho photoreceptors were preserved by genetically over - activating the proteasome by 428 crossing the untagged P23H - Rho knockin mouse with mice constitutively overexpressing either 429 the PA28α or PSMD11 proteasomal cap protein ( 57 ) . Therefore , the ER membrane expansion 430 we observed in P23H - RFP / + rods with TEM ( Fig 8 ) could a be compensatory ER stress 431 mechanism in response to an overload of ERAD and proteasome degradation . Such an 432 adaptation warrants further study . In TEM images of P14 P23H - RFP / + rods , we also observed 433 double membrane autophagosome - like structures adjacent to the ER ( Fig 8A ) , indicating an 434 autophagy component to the P23H - RFP pathology . Similar double membrane vesiculations 435 were observed in transgenic bovine - P23H - Rho Xenopus tadpoles that were exposed to light 436 31 ( 23 ) , and more recently LC3 - positive autophagosomes were localized adjacent to P23H - Rho 437 protein in the inner segments of these same Xenopus rods expressing bovine - P23H - Rho ( 58 ) . 438 We observed a deterioration in the morphology of the accumulated ER IS membranes in 439 P23H - RFP / + rods from age P14 to P30 with both RFP fluorescence ( Fig 4 ) and TEM ( Fig 8 ) . In 440 addition to large IS membrane whorls in the IS at P30 ( Fig 8C ) , the ER membrane structures 441 were more disorganized than the tight membrane stacks at P14 . We also observed ER at the 442 photoreceptor synapse carrying mislocalized P23HhRhoRFP protein in the OPL of P30 P23H - 443 RFP / + retinas ( Fig 10 ) . Rhodopsin mislocalization to the synapse layer and in the ONL 444 cytoplasm was previously observed in P23H - Rho transgenic mice ( 31 ) . This suggests that the 445 ER expands throughout the entire cytoplasmic space in rods by P30 as a broad response to the 446 accumulation of misfolded P23H - Rho protein in the ER . 447 Despite the expanded ER membranes filled with P23HhRhoRFP protein , the 448 morphology of the CC and the OS disc structure was normal in P23H - RFP / + rods at age P14 449 ( Fig 8A - B ) . At P30 , the OS discs is some P23H - RFP / + rods were slightly dysmorphic , but the 450 CC structure appeared structurally intact , albeit longer than in + / + rods ( Fig 8C - D ) . The CC 451 elongation P23H - RFP / + rods is a surprising result . Such an elongation phenotype was also 452 described in knockout mouse models for 2 CC - localized proteins : male germ cell - associated 453 kinase ( Mak ) and Huntingtin ( 59 , 60 ) . In both knockouts , the elongated CC was accompanied 454 with aberrant OS morphology and Rho mislocalization . One possible cause of the elongated CC 455 in P23H - RFP / + mutant rods may be an early imbalance of Rho expression during an early 456 ciliogenesis stage due to mutant P23H - Rho - RFP expression . 457 Our analysis of the rate of rod neuronal death using TUNEL staining of the ONL in 458 P23H - RFP mouse retinas is additional evidence that P23H - RFP / + mutant rods undergo a long - 459 term neuroprotective response . Unlike in P23H - RFP / P23H - RFP homozygous retinas where the 460 TUNEL + rate in the ONL is elevated at P14 , the rate of TUNEL + nuclei spikes at P30 in P23H / + 461 heterozygous retinas and returns to a level not significantly higher than + / + retinas by P90 ( Fig . 462 32 7C ) . Interestingly , a similar spike in TUNEL staining was also observed in both P23H - Rho 463 transgenic rats at age P18 vs age P30 ( 32 ) and in the untagged P23H - Rho knockin mouse at 464 age P19 vs P31 ( 61 ) . 465 In conclusion , our RFP fusion knockin model of adRP retinal degeneration caused by the 466 P23H rhodopsin mutation is a unique model for the disease with clear phenotypes that are 467 traceable with both fluorescence microscopy and TEM . The mutant rods in our P23H - RFP / + 468 mice demonstrate an adaptation that promotes rod photoreceptor survival , and thus the 469 heterozygous mutant retinas have a mild rate of retinal degeneration . As such , our model will be 470 useful to test the variety of proof - of - concept adRP therapies that have been developed across 471 all P23H - Rho models in the field . These include : genetic suppression and replacement 472 strategies ( 62 , 63 ) , CRISPR / Cas9 mutant allele deletions ( 64 - 66 ) , genetic inhibition of the 473 autophagy - activating Atg5 ( 67 ) , caspase pathway inhibitors ( 61 , 68 ) , a small molecule inhibitor 474 of the photoreceptor specific transcriptional modulator Nr2e3 ( 69 ) , and pharmacological 475 treatments with valproic acid and other histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitors ( 70 ) . Future 476 studies that investigate the mechanisms of action for these therapies can be tested in this 477 P23H - RFP mouse for the development of the most efficient and synergistic treatments of P23H - 478 Rho and adRP . 479 480 Materials and Methods 481 Animals 482 The P23H - hRho - TagRFP knock - in mice were generated the same way we previously 483 generated P23H - hRho - GFP knock - in mice ( 35 ) , by gene targeting in the HPRT − embryonic stem 484 ( ES ) cell line AB2 . 2 123 , which was derived from mouse strain 129SvEv , essentially as 485 described previously ( 41 , 42 ) . The targeting plasmid plasmid contained 5’ and 3’ sequences 486 identical to flanking sequences of the mouse rhodopsin gene , an intervening sequence 487 corresponding to the human Rhodopsin gene encoding the P23H mutation found in patients , a 488 33 C - terminal fusion with the fluorescent protein Tag RFP - T , a final C - terminal peptide 489 corresponding to the C - terminal 9 residues of human rhodopsin ( TETSQVAPA , the epitope for 490 the 1D4 monoclonal antibody and a putative outer segment targeting signal ) , a STOP codon , 491 and an endogenous polyadenylation signal , followed by an expression cassette ( minigene ) for 492 human hypoxanthinephosphoribosyltransferase ( HPRT ) . The HPRT minigene was flanked by 493 loxP sites , so it could be looped out in vivo by passing through the germline of GDF - 9 - iCre mice 494 ( 44 ) expressing Cre recombinase in oocytes . The plasmid also contained a minigene for 495 Herpes Simplex Virus thymidine kinase ( TK ) outside the region of homology for negative 496 selection against non - homologous insertion . We introduced the P23H mutation into the targeting 497 vector by site - directed mutagenesis ( QuikChange Ⓡ , Stratagene ) . An ISceI recognition site was 498 engineered into the middle of the first intron in the rhodopsin gene at position 1340 from the 499 start of translation , but it was not used in the experiments described here . The targeting vector 500 was constructed in such a way that there is no Lox site between the MOPS promoter and the 501 rhodopsin transcription unit . 502 The Darwin Transgenic Core Facility , Baylor College of Medicine , electroporated ES cells and 503 injected correctly targeted ES cells ( those selected for HPRT + TK - genotype ) into blastocysts 504 from albino C57BL / 6 - Tyr c - Brd mice ( 43 ) . Founder mice carrying the HPRT - P23H - hRho - TagRFP 505 allele were crossed to GDF - 9 - iCre mice ( 44 ) to remove the HPRT minigene and screened to 506 ensure germline transmission of the correct targeted sequence without HPRT . P23H - hRho - 507 TagRFP mice were extensively backcrossed to C57BL / 6 mice . We validated that the knockin 508 was successful by sequencing genomic DNA from the knockin mouse . We verified expression 509 of the P23HhRhoRFP fusion by fluorescence microscopy of retinas and by immunoblotting ( Fig . 510 1 , Fig . 2 ) . 511 The P23H - human - rhodopsin - RFP ( P23H - RFP ) knockin mice were generated by the BCM 512 Genetically Engineered Mouse core , using a strategy similar to the one previously described for 513 34 our P23H - Rho - GFP knockin ( 35 ) . Homologous recombination in ES cells under positive HPRT 514 selection ( HAT medium ) was carried out with a plasmid containing 5’ and 3’ sequences identical 515 to flanking sequences of the mouse rhodopsin gene , an intervening sequence corresponding to 516 the human Rhodopsin gene encoding the P23H mutation found in patients , a C - terminal fusion 517 with the fluorescent protein Tag RFP - T , a final C - terminal peptide corresponding to the C - 518 terminal 9 residues of human rhodopsin ( TETSQVAPA , the epitope for the 1D4 monoclonal 519 antibody and a putative outer segment targeting signal ) , a STOP codon , an endogenous 520 polyadenylation signal , followed by an expression cassette ( minigene ) for human 521 hypoxanthinephosphoribosyltransferase ( HPRT ) . The HPRT minigene was flanked by loxP 522 sites , so it could be looped out in vivo by passing through the germline of a Zp3Cre mouse 523 expressing Cre recombinase in oocytes ( 71 , 72 ) . 524 The junction between the mouse and human RHO sequences is at the SacI site in the 525 5’UTR between the transcription start sites and the translation start sites . Unlike our P23H - Rho - 526 GFP knockin described previously ( 35 ) , there was no lox site added to the 5’UTR , although 527 there is a lone loxP site remaining in the 3’ - end following loop - out of the HPRT minigene . The 528 sequence of the P23H - hRho - TagRFPr allele was verified by Sanger sequencing . We generated 529 a new hRho - EGFP knockin mouse line with an additional C - terminal 1D4 epitope sequence tag 530 by a similar approach , using WT human rhodopsin sequence and EGFP coding sequence 531 instead of Tag - RFP - T . Generation of the original hRho - EGFP knockin line was described 532 previously ( 41 ) 533 Both P23H - RFP and hRho - EGFP - 1D4 mice were extensively backcrossed to C57BL / 6 534 ( > 10 generations ) . Wild - type ( + / + ) C57BL / 6 littermates were used as controls throughout this 535 study . The following genotyping PCR primers were used for the P23HhRhoRFP knockin allele 536 ( 5’ - GTTCCGGAACTGCATGCTCACCAC ) and ( 5’ - GGCGCTGCTCCTGGTGGG ) , which 537 generate a 975 kb knockin band and 194bp WT band . 538 35 All animal research in this study was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use 539 Committee at Baylor College of Medicine , and was carried out in accordance with the guidelines 540 set forth in the Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research of the 541 Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology ( ARVO ) . 542 543 Western blotting 544 Retinal lysates were made by needle extruding mouse retinas in ice - cold Cracking 545 buffer : 25 mM Tris ( pH 8 ) , 300 mM sucrose , 15 mM EDTA , 2 mM MgCl 2 + 1x protease inhibitor 546 cocktail ( GenDepot ) , and lysates were cleared with centrifugation . Protein concentration was 547 calculated with the BCA assay ( Bio - Rad ) , and sample application buffer was added to lysates , 548 which were sonicated to reduce sample viscosity . 100 µg of each lysate sample was loaded on 549 10 % acrylamide gels for SDS - PAGE . Gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose in Tris - Glycine - 550 SDS buffer and probed with primary antibodies : anti - 1D4 ( Rho ) at 1 µg / ml , anti - RFP ( Kerafast , 551 6a11f ) at 1 µg / ml , anti - beta - actin ( Cell Signaling Technology , 8HD10 ) diluted 1 : 1000 . Mouse 552 monoclonal anti - 1D4 ( 73 ) was purified in - house from hybridoma culture medium . Membranes 553 were secondary labeled with one of the following secondary antibodies : anti - mouse or anti - 554 rabbit IRDye680 ( LI - COR Biosciences ) , diluted 1 : 10 , 000 , and were imaged on a LI - COR 555 Odyssey imager . For clarity , the minimum and maximum input values from Western blot scans 556 were adjusted maintaining a linear slope . 557 558 Retinal immunofluorescence 559 For cyrosectioning , mouse eyes were enucleated and either 1 ) cornea punctured and 560 immersion fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde ( PFA ) diluted in 1x PBS for 45 mins at room 561 temperature before the cornea and lens were removed in 1xPBS , or 2 ) the cornea and lens 562 were removed and 1xPBS and eye cups were directly embedded Optical Cutting Temperature 563 ( OCT ) media in plastic cryomolds and flash frozen on a floating liquid nitrogen platform . Fixed 564 36 eye cups were cryoprotected in 30 % sucrose before mounting in OCT in plastic molds and flash 565 freezing . 8 µm – 10 µm cryosections were collected on poly - L - lysine coated glass slides ( EMS ) , 566 and unfixed eye cups sections were immediately fixed with 2 % PFA for 2 minutes . This light 567 fixation method was used for all immunolabeling experiments that included anti - centrin cilia 568 immunolabeling . Superior - inferior positions were marked in eyes to be used for retina thickness 569 measurements prior to enucleation to maintain proper orientation throughout fixation and 570 sectioning . 571 For immunohistochemistry , sections were blocked with either 2 % normal goat serum 572 ( NGS ) ( Fitzgerald ) , 2 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) ( Sigma ) , 2 % fish skin gelatin ( FSG ) 573 ( Sigma ) , 0 . 2 % saponin diluted in 1x PBS , or with SUPER block : 15 % NGS , 5 % BSA , 5 % BSA - c 574 ( Aurion ) , 5 % FSG , 0 . 2 % saponin in 1xPBS ( sections from Fig 7C - D , Fig 9 , Fig 10 ) . Blocked 575 sections were probed with 0 . 5 µg – 2 µg of primary antibodies in the same blocking buffer 576 overnight at room temperature , protected from light . The following antibodies were used : mouse 577 anti - centrin ( 20H5 ) ( EMD Millipore , 04 - 1624 ) ; rabbit anti - centrin 2 ( Proteintech , 15877 - 1 - AP ) ; 578 rabbit anti - BiP ( Abcam , ab21685 ) ; mouse anti - KDEL ( 10C3 ) ( Sigma - Aldrich , 420400 ) ; mouse 579 anti - GM130 ( 35 / GM130 ) ( BD , 610822 ) ; rabbit anti - cone arrestin ( EMD Millipore , AB15282 ) . 580 Sections were washed in 1x PBS and probed with following secondary antibodies : 581 F ( ab’ ) 2 - goat anti - mouse / anti - rabbit IgG Alexa 488 ( Thermo Fisher ) , F ( ab’ ) 2 - goat anti - 582 mouse / anti - rabbit IgG Alexa 555 ( Thermo Fisher ) , or F ( ab’ ) 2 - goat anti - mouse / anti - rabbit IgG 583 Alexa 647 ( Thermo Fisher ) , diluted 1 : 500 in blocking buffer , for 1 – 1 . 5 hours at room 584 temperature , protected from light . Sections were counterstained with 0 . 3 µM DAPI for 1 hour 585 protected from light . Widefield and confocal sections were mounted with # 1 . 5 coverslips in 586 VECTASHIELD ( Vector Laboratories ) , and SIM sections were mounted in ProLong Glass 587 ( Thermo Fisher ) . 588 Widefield imaging was performed on an inverted Nikon Eclipse TE2000U microscope 589 with mercury lamp excitation , a 10x objective ( Nikon , Plan Fluor 10x ) and imaging via a 590 37 Photometrics CoolSnap cf Photometrics digital camera ( Roper Scientific ) and excitation via a 591 mercury lamp using dichroic mirrors and filters for excitation and emission wavelength selection . 592 Full retina sections were generated by merging overlapping captures in Fiji / ImageJ using the 593 “Stitching” plugin ( 74 , 75 ) . ONL thickness was measured from these full retina section files in 594 Fiji / ImageJ . The position of the optic nerve was designated as position “0” ; we then traced the 595 DAPI + ONL along the superior ( positive nm positions ) and inferior ( negative nm positions ) 596 retina . At each position to be measured , we drew a rectangular Region of Interest with edges at 597 the top and bottom of the ONL with a constant perpendicular length of 50 µm at each position 598 and collected ONL thickness measurements . 599 Confocal imaging was performed on either a Leica TCS - SP5 laser scanning confocal 600 microscope with a 63x oil immersion objective ( Leica , HC PL APO CS2 63 . 0x , numerical 601 aperture 1 . 40 ) or a Zeiss LSM710 laser scanning microscopy with a 63x oil immersion objective 602 ( Zeiss Plan Apo 63 . 0x , numerical aperture 1 . 40 ) . On both systems , sequential imaging scans 603 with 405 diode , 488 nm argon , 543 nm HeNe , and 633 nm HeNe lasers were performed with 604 parameters set to capture sub - saturation fluorescence and to avoid cross - talk . Z - stacks of 1 µm 605 optical confocal sections were projected in Fiji / ImageJ based on maximum intensity values . 606 SIM imaging was performed on a DeltaVision OMX Blaze Imaging System ( v4 ) ( GE 607 Healthcare ) with a PLANPON6 60x / NA 1 . 42 ( Olympus ) oil immersion objective using oil with a 608 refractive index of 1 . 520 . The system features 488 nm , 568 nm and 647 nm laser lines , and a 609 front illuminated Edge sCMOS ( PCO ) camera . Images were captured in sequential SIM mode 610 with 15 fringe shift images acquired per optical section per channel . SIM reconstruction was 611 subsequently performed in softWoRx 7 software . Z stacks of 125 nm optical SIM sections were 612 projected in Fiji / ImageJ based on max intensity values . 613 All images were pseudo - colored and processed for clarity in Fiji / ImageJ ; minimum and 614 maximum input values were adjusted maintaining a linear slope . Magnified images of rod cilia 615 were digitally straightened with the Straighten tool in Fiji / ImageJ . 616 38 617 ERG 618 Mice were dark adapted overnight and anesthetized with 90 mg / kg ketamine + 14 mg / kg 619 xylazine . 0 . 5 % tropicamide was added as a mydriatic to both eyes with 2 . 5 % phenylephrine 620 hydrochloride and 0 . 5 % proparacaine hydrochloride for analgesia / anesthesia . 2 . 5 % 621 methylcellulose was used to maintain conductivity and for corneal hydration . A ground electrode 622 was inserted into the mouse forehead , and wire electrode loops were placed over each eye . We 623 used the UTAS BigShot Visual Electrodiagnostic System ( LKC Technologies ) for ERG 624 recordings . Mice were placed within a Ganzfeld chamber and responses were recorded per a 625 sampling rate of 2000 Hz using a 60 Hz notch filter . Scotopic recordings were averaged from 30 626 flashes for the intensity range of - 55 dB to - 10 dB at 5 dB increments . Photopic recordings were 627 collected after adapting the mouse to a constant background light ( 30 cd / m2 ) for 7 minutes . 628 Recordings were averaged from 60 flashes for - 10 dB and 0 dB intensities , and 20 flashes for 5 629 dB and 10 dB intensities . We converted intensity values from dB to log [ cd * s / m² ] values based 630 on the instrument’s calibration data . 631 ERG wave data was visualized and analyzed using a custom Mathematica code 632 previously described ( 76 ) . Scotopic a - wave amplitude was baseline to the minimum value of the 633 first 35 ms post - flash . Scotopic b - waves were determined after a low pass filtering at 55 Hz ; 634 amplitudes were the a - wave minimum to the maximum of the filtered data between 30 - 120 ms 635 post - flash . Implicit time was the time in ms between the a - wave to the b - wave values . Photopic 636 b - wave waves were also filtered and were baseline to the maximum between 30 - 120 ms post - 637 flash . 638 639 Transmission Electron Microscopy 640 The following TEM preparation , based on ( 8 ) , enhances staining and contrast of internal 641 cell membranes in rod photoreceptors . Mouse eyes for TEM were cornea punctured in the 642 39 following ice - cold TEM fixative : 2 % PFA , 2 % glutaraldehyde ( EMS ) , 2 . 2mM CaCl 2 diluted in 50 643 mM MOPS buffer ( pH 7 . 4 ) and were then immersion fixed in the same fixative for either 1 ) 45 644 mins at room temperature with gentle agitation followed by cornea and lens removal and 645 another 1 . 5 hours on ice , or 2 ) 4°C overnight before cornea and lens removal . Fixed eye cups 646 were embedded in 4 % low melt agarose , and 150 µm vibratome sections were cut along the 647 longitudinal plane . Sections were fixed in 1 % tannic acid ( EMS ) , 0 . 5 % saponin ( Calbiochem ) 648 diluted in 0 . 1 M HEPES ( pH 7 . 3 ) for 1 hour at room temperature with gentle rocking . After 649 rinsing again , sections were stained with 1 % uranyl acetate ( EMS ) diluted in 0 . 1 maleate buffer 650 ( pH 6 ) for 1 hour at room temperature with gentle rocking . 651 Sections were then dehydrated in the following ethanol series : 50 % , 70 % , 90 % , 100 % , 652 100 % , in half dram glass vials filled with 1 mL of dehydrant . For Eponate 12 embedding , 653 sections were additionally dehydrated in 100 % acetone 2x , for 15 minutes . Using the solutions 654 of the PELCO Eponate 12 kit with DMP - 30 ( Ted Pella ) , a medium hardness resin mix ( without 655 accelerator ) was prepared and mixed . After dehydrating , the sections were embedded in stages 656 of Eponate 12 resin mix to acetone for the following incubation times : 50 % : 50 % ( 5 hours ) , 657 75 % : 25 % ( overnight , 16 - 20 hours ) , 100 % resin mix ( 8 hours ) , 100 % resin mix ( overnight , 16 - 20 658 hours ) . The DMP - 30 accelerator was added to the Eponate 12 resin mix just before mixing or 659 incubating . All embedding steps were incubated on a room temperature roller set to a slow 660 speed . 661 Resin embedded sections were then mounted in full resin either between two sheets of 662 ACLAR Film ( EMS ) or in an inverted BEEM embedding capsules ( EMS ) . Mounted sections 663 were cured at 65°C for at least 48 hours . 70 - 100 nm ultrathin resin sections were cut on a Leica 664 UC6 ultramicrotome with a Diatome diamond knife . Ultrathin sections were collected onto 665 cleaned 100 mesh copper grids ( EMS ) . Grids for TEM were post - stained on glue sticks first in 666 1 . 2 % uranyl acetate ( diluted in Milli - Q water ) for 4 - 6 minutes , then in Sato’s Lead for 4 - 6 667 minutes after rinsing in boiled Milli - Q water and drying . Grids were rinsed again and dried before 668 40 storage . Imaging was performed on either a Hitachi H7500 TEM or JEOL JEM - 1400 at 669 magnifications up to 25000x . TEM images were processed for clarity in Fiji / ImageJ by adjusting 670 the minimum and maximum input values ( maintaining a linear slope ) for contrast and with the 671 Straighten tool . 672 673 RNA extraction and relative quantification of mRNA 674 Six pairs of retinas from three postnatal day 30 ( P30 ) WT C57BL / 6 mice and three P30 675 P23H - RFP / + heterozygous mice were collected and homogenized for RNA extraction . Direct - 676 zol™ RNA MiniPrep Kit ( Genesee Scientific / Zymo Research , Catalog No : R2051 ) was used for 677 RNA extraction and 25μl of DNase / RNase free was used for elution . RNA extraction product 678 was diluted 20 - fold in DNase / RNase free water ( from Zymo Research Direct - zol™ RNA 679 MiniPrep Kit ) before recording the UV absorbance spectra on a Hewlett Packard 8452 Diode 680 Array Spectrophotometer . Only RNA samples with 1 . 7 ≤ 𝐴𝐴 260 / A 280 ratio ≤ 2 . 0 was used for 681 Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction ( RT - PCR ) experiments . 5 µl of the RNA 682 extraction product was run on a 1 % agarose gel to examine purity . RNA samples with 28S / 18S 683 ratio ≥ 2 were used for analysis . The total RNA input for each RT - PCR reaction was 500 ng . 684 RT - PCR was performed using LunaScript RT SuperMix Kit ( New England Biolabs – Catalog No : 685 E3010L ) . Each Complementary DNA ( cDNA ) sample from RT - PCR was diluted 100 - fold prior to 686 quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction ( qPCR ) . In the Amplifyt™ 96 - Well PCR Plate ( Thomas 687 Scientific , Catalog No : 1148B05 ) , 4 ul of the diluted cDNA was added per qPCR reaction 688 followed by 16ul of master mix with target gene qPCR primers ( See primer nucleotide 689 sequences in Table 1 ) , Luna® Universal qPCR Master Mix ( New England Biolabs , Catalog No : 690 M3003L ) and DEPC treated water . Per qPCR run , three technical replicates were run per 691 biological replicate . Plates were sealed by LightCycler® 480 Seal Foil ( Roche Life Science , 692 Catalog No : 04 729 757 001 ) then spun down in a mini plate spinner . The qPCR reactions were 693 carried out using the C1000 Touch™ Thermal Cycler ( BioRad ) and the SYBR fluorescent data 694 41 collected using the CFX96 Optical Reaction Module for Real - Time PCR Systems ( BioRad ) . 695 Reactions with primers specific for the genes encoding HPRT1 and RPL19 were carried out in 696 parallel for normalization . Data were extracted from CFX BioRad Manager 3 . 1 as 2007 Excel 697 files . C q values from 3 technical replicates ( with standard deviation ≤ 0 . 25 ) were averaged then 698 converted to Relative Quantification Value ( RQ value ) following Livak Method . Graph design 699 and statistical significance analysis of calculated RQ values were carried out using GraphPad 700 Prism 8 . 4 . 3 . A 95 % confidence interval for a two - tailed t - Test was used as the criterion for 701 statistical significance . P values for the two - tailed t - tests are reported . 702 703 42 Table 1 : Q - RTPCR Primer Nucleotide Sequences : Gene Forward Primer Reverse Primer Source * HPRT 5’ - CAGTCCCAGCGTCGTGATTA - 3’ 5’ - TGGCCTCCCATCTCCTTCAT - 3’ RPL19 5’ - ATGCCAACTCCCGTCAGCAG - 3’ 5′ - TCATCCTTCTCATCCAGGTCACC - 3’ ( 77 ) BiP 5’ - ACTTGGGACCACCTATTCCT - 3’ 5’ - ATCGCCAATCAGACGCTCC - 3’ ( 78 ) DERL1 5′ - CGCGATTTAAGGCCTGTTAC - 3′ 5′ - GGTAGCCAGCGGTACAAAAA - 3′ ( 77 ) XBP1 5′ - GAGTCCGCAGCAGGTG - 3′ 5′ - GTGTCAGAGTCCATGGGA - 3′ ( 77 ) CHOP 5’ - CTGGAAGCCTGGTATGAGGAT - 3’ 5’ - CAGGGTCAAGAGTAGTGAAGGT - 3’ ( 78 ) ATF6 5’ - TGCCTTGGGAGTCAGACCTAT - 3’ 5’ - GCTGAGTTGAAGAACACGAGTC - 3’ ( 78 ) PERK 5’ - AGTCCCTGCTCGAATCTTCTT - 3’ 5’ - TCCCAAGGCAGAACAGATATACC - 3’ ( 78 ) EIF2a 5’ - TATCCCAACTTTGCCGGACC - 3’ 5’ - AGGCTCCTGTCTTGTCAACC - 3’ mRho 5’ - CCATGGCAGTTCTCCATGCT - 3’ 5’ - CATCTCCCAGTGATTCTTGCC - 3’ mhRho 5’ - CCATGGCAGTTCTCCATGCT - 3’ 5’ - TTCTCCCCGAAGCGGAAGTT - 3’ ( 62 ) * All primer sequences not sourced from the literature were designed with Primer - BLAST ( NCBI ) for specificity and to span exon - exon junctions . 43 707 Statistical analysis 708 Unpaired Student’s t - tests , Two - way ANOVA with Šídák multiple comparison tests , and 709 cubic spline curve fittings were performed in GraphPad Prism® software . Each decline in ONL 710 width with age was fit to a single exponential decay as W ( t ) = ( W ( 0 ) – W ( ∞ ) ) exp - ( t / τ ) + W ( ∞ ) 711 Where W ( t ) is the measured width at age , W ( ∞ ) is the plateau value to which it declines , W ( 0 ) 712 is an initial value , and τ is the time constant . The data were fit to the equation with W ( 0 ) , W ( ∞ ) 713 and τ as floating fit parameters in a Marquardt - Levenberg least - squares fitting algorithm using 714 Prism® . 715 716 44 Acknowledgements 717 The authors would like to thank Dr .

Construction and validation of the P23H - hRho - TagRFP - T knockin mouse . ( A ) 731 Targeting construct used in embryonic stem cells and resulting gene structure after germline 732 transmission . ( B ) A map of the knock - in human P23H - rhodopsin - RFP fusion gene . A portion of 733 the sequence of exon 1 from the P23H - Rho allele in the fusion gene ( blue ) is aligned to the 734 same human wild - type ( WT ) Rho allele sequence ( black ) . The mutated codon 23 is in bold font . 735 The transition sequence from the 1D4 terminal signal sequence to the Tag - RFP - T with a short 736 linker sequence is shown in the middle sequence panel and the C - terminal sequence with the 737 extra 1D4 epitope sequence appended to the end Tag - RFP - T prior to the stop codon . ( C ) 738 Western blot confirmation of the P23HhRhoRFP fusion protein expression in P23H - RFP / + 739 heterozygous retinas . Retinal lysates are from a wild - type ( + / + ) mouse , age P22 , and a P23H - 740 RFP / + mouse , age 45 ; 100 µg of total protein from each lysate was loaded onto SDS - PAGE 741 gels . Blot membranes were probed with either of the following antibodies : anti - 1D4 , anti - RFP or 742 anti - beta ( ß ) - actin ( a loading control ) . Blot scans for the protein ladder were used to mark 743 molecular weight sizes ( in kilodaltons , kDa ) on the left of each blot image . The ~ 65 kDa 744 P23HhRhoRFP fusion protein band is present in the P23H - RFP / + lane in both anti - 1D4 and 745 anti - RFP blot scans ( magenta arrows ) . The monomeric mouse Rho protein band is in both lanes 746 in the anti - 1D4 blot scan ( black arrow ) . Higher MW species are formed by rhodopsin 747 multimerization . 748 Figure 2 . Localization of RFP fluorescence in the P23H - hRho - RFP knockin mouse retina . 749 ( A ) Widefield fluorescence images of mouse retinal cryosections from age - matched P30 wild - 750 type ( + / + ) , heterozygous ( P23H - RFP / + ) and homozygous knockin mice ( P23H - RFP / P23H - 751 RFP ) . Sections were counterstained with DAPI to label nuclei in the retina ( blue ) . RFP 752 fluorescence from the mutant P23HhRhoRFP fusion protein is shown in magenta . Magnified 753 regions from each section are insets , and the outer nuclear layer ( ONL ) of each retina , which is 754 the location of the DAPI + photoreceptor nuclei , is demarcated . ( B ) Confocal z - projection image 755 47 of a retinal cryosection from a P30 heterozygous P23H - RFP / + mouse . The brightest RFP signal 756 is in the outer photoreceptor layers , the inner segment and outer segment region ( IS / OS ) , where 757 P23HhRhoRFP protein is localized in aggregates . In the same image , with the gain of the RFP 758 signal raised to saturation , additional P23HhRhoRFP protein is observed in the rod 759 photoreceptor synapses within the outer plexiform layer ( yellow arrows ) . To a lesser degree , 760 P23HhRhoRFP is also localized in the ONL , in the cytoplasm surrounding the photoreceptor 761 nuclei ( white arrows ) . ( C ) Confocal z - projection through a retinal cryosection from a P30 P23H - 762 RFP / P23H - RFP homozygote . The width of the DAPI - positive ONL is thinner compared to the 763 heterozygote . In the homozygous retina , mutant P23HhRhoRFP fusion protein is also more 764 prominently localized in the ONL compared to the heterozygote . INL = inner nuclear layer . 765 Figure 3 . P23HhRhoRFP + fusion aggregates are localized in the inner segments of rod 766 photoreceptor neurons . ( A ) In a confocal z - projection image of a retinal section from the 767 hRho - GFP - 1D4 / P23H - RFP heterozygous mouse retina , at 3 weeks of age , the wild - type hRho - 768 GFP fusion ( green ) , which has an additional C - terminal 1D4 signal sequence , is correctly 769 localized to the outer segments ( OS ) of rod neurons . In this retina , RFP + aggregates containing 770 mutant P23HhRhoRFP protein ( magenta ) are primarily located in the inner segments ( IS ) of 771 rods and almost entirely segregated from the GFP + OS layer . White dotted lines in the figure 772 demarcate the OS / IS boundary and the IS / outer nuclear layer ( ONL ) boundary . ( B ) In SIM 773 micrographs of retinal sections from the same heterozygous mouse line at age 6 weeks , GFP + 774 OS and RFP + IS aggregates remain segregated with no apparent co - localization . ( C ) In SIM 775 images of retinal sections from an alternate GFP / RFP heterozygote at age P30 , in which the 776 wild - type hRho - GFP fusion does not have an additional 1D4 signal peptide , the GFP 777 fluorescence is not exclusively located in the OS layer , but rather is partially mislocalized with 778 P23H - hRho - RFP . In a magnified example , hRho - GFP is co - localized around and within a 779 P23HhRhoRFP aggregate ( yellow arrows ) . In another magnified example , hRho - GFP is 780 wrapped around an P23HhRhoRFP aggregate ( white arrow ) . 781 48 Figure 4 . Mutant P23H - hRho - RFP inner segment aggregates are localized near the basal 782 body in rod neurons . ( A ) In a SIM z - projection image of a retinal section from the P23H - RFP / + 783 mouse at age P14 , centrin immunolabeling ( green ) marks the location of rod connecting cilium 784 ( CC ) and basal body ( BB ) relative to the P23HhRhoRFP fluorescent aggregates ( magenta ) . In 785 magnified views , single RFP + inner segment aggregates are located just proximal to the CC 786 ( yellow arrow ) and BB ( white stars ) . The BB region is demarcated by the centrin + mother 787 centriole at the proximal end of the CC and the daughter centriole , which is a separated centrin + 788 puncta beneath the mother centriole . ( B ) A SIM image of a retinal section from the P23H - RFP / + 789 mouse at age P30 also with centrin immunolabeling . In magnified views , the RFP + aggregates 790 at P30 are still generally located proximal to the BB ( white stars ) , with some examples of RFP 791 overlapping with the BB region . The organization of the RFP + aggregates in these P30 rods are 792 less compact and more reticulated compared to the examples from age P14 ( see examples in 793 A ) . 794 Figure 5 . Time course of retinal degeneration in P23H - RFP / + heterozygous and P23H - 795 RFP / + homozygous mice . ( A ) Confocal z - projection images of retinal cryosections from wild - 796 type ( + / + ) , and P23H - RFP heterozygote ( het ) and P23H - RFP / P23H - RFP homozygous ( homo ) 797 mice at various time points . DAPI ( blue ) labels photoreceptor nuclei in the outer nuclear layer 798 ( ONL ) and the bipolar cell nuclei in the inner nuclear layer ( INL ) . RFP fluorescence ( magenta ) is 799 primarily located in the inner segment layers of het retinas at all time points , while RFP is also 800 located in the ONL in homo retinas . At P90 , the homo ONL is reduced to very few disorganized 801 nuclei surrounded by RFP . ( B ) Time course plot of ONL thickness between genotypes . 802 Measurements correspond to the ONL thickness of the retina 500 µm inferior to the optic nerve . 803 Unfilled shapes correspond to the mean value , and error bars signify standard error of the 804 mean . Solid lines represent fits to exponential decays to plateau , as described in Methods . 805 Unpaired t - tests were calculated to compare + / + and het values for significance . Comparisons 806 with significant differences are : P61 + / + vs P60 het ( * * p = 0 . 0081 ) , P90 + / + vs P90 het 807 49 ( * * p = 0 . 0072 ) , and P330 + / + vs P364 het ( * * p = 0 . 0035 ) . ( C ) “Spider” plots of ONL thickness for 808 13 positions in + / + retinal cryosections from the P14 , P30 and P90 time points , spanning 809 positions from the optic nerve to the inferior and superior retina . Positions directly adjacent to 810 the optic nerve position ( “0” ) correspond to 100 µm superior and inferior to the optic nerve . The 811 most peripheral positions of each plot correspond to 100 µm from the superior and inferior ends 812 of the retina . For each position on the plots , circles correspond to mean values and error bars 813 signify standard error of the mean . ( D ) Corresponding spider plots for P14 , P30 , and P90 P23H - 814 RFP / + het retinal cryosections . Tests for statistical differences between plots from different time 815 points were performed using Two - way ANOVA with Šídák multiple comparisons test . The only 816 test with significance is P14 het vs P90 het ( * P = 0 . 0215 ) . ( E ) Spider plots for P23H - RFP 817 homozygous retinal cryosections at the same time points . Two - way ANOVA with Šídák multiple 818 comparison tests produced significant differences between all time points : P14 vs P30 , P14 vs 819 90 , and P30 vs P90 ( all * * * * P < 0 . 0001 ) . ( F ) Spider plots for all retinal cryosections at timepoint 820 P30 to compare differences between genotypes . Two - way ANOVA with Šídák multiple 821 comparison tests produced significant differences at P30 between : + / + vs homo and het vs 822 homo . ( both * * * * P < 0 . 0001 ) . ( G ) Spider plots for timepoint P90 to compare genotypes . Two - way 823 ANOVA with Šídák multiple comparison tests produced significant differences at P90 between : 824 + / + vs homo . and het . vs homo . ( both * * * * P < 0 . 0001 ) . 825 Figure 6 . P23H - RFP / + heterozygous mice have slightly reduced rod photoreceptor 826 electroretinogram ( ERG ) responses . ( A ) Example ERG recordings from + / + wild - type , P23H - 827 RFP / + heterozygous ( het ) and P23H - RFP / P23H - RFP homozygous ( homo ) mice at age P30 . ( B ) 828 Aggregate of P30 scotopic a - wave amplitudes . In all plots , solid shapes are data points , empty 829 shapes signify mean values , and error bars signify standard error of the mean . Statistical 830 comparison tests of all the ERG data were performed using Two - way ANOVA with Šídák 831 multiple comparisons tests . All statistical comparisons of P30 a - wave amplitudes were 832 significant : + / + vs het ( * * * * P < 0 . 0001 ) , + / + vs homo ( * * * * P < 0 . 0001 ) , and het vs homo 833 50 ( * * * * P < 0 . 0001 ) . ( C ) Scotopic a - wave amplitudes between P30 and P90 P23H / + het mice were 834 not statistically different ( P = 0 . 27 ) . ( D ) Aggregate of P30 scotopic b - wave amplitudes . 835 Statistically significant differences were calculated for + / + vs homo ( * * * * P < 0 . 0001 ) and het vs 836 homo ( * * * * P < 0 . 0001 ) . WT vs het was not statistically different ( P = 0 . 9744 ) ( E ) Scotopic b - wave 837 amplitudes between P30 and P90 P23H / + het mice were not statistically different ( P = 0 . 9375 ) . 838 ( F ) Aggregate implicit times , the time to peak scotopic b - wave post a - wave , in P30 + / + and het 839 mice . P30 het mice had higher implicit times than + / + at intermediate flash stages , but the 840 difference over the entire flash range was not statistically significant ( P = 0 . 5651 ) . ( G ) Aggregate 841 of P30 photopic b - wave amplitudes . There were no statistically significant differences among 842 the genotypes : + / + vs het ( P = 0 . 749 ) , + / + vs homo ( P = 0 . 1298 ) , het vs homo ( P = 0 . 1553 ) . 843 Figure 7 .

( A , B ) Examples of cone arrestin immunofluorescence staining 845 ( yellow ) in retinal sections from ages P30 ( A ) and P90 ( B ) , among + / + , P23H - RFP / + , and P23H - 846 RFP / P23H - RFP mice . DAPI staining ( blue ) labels both photoreceptor nuclei in the outer nuclear 847 layer ( ONL ) and in the inner nuclear layer ( INL ) . ( C ) TUNEL fluorescence analysis of 848 photoreceptor cell in retinal cryosections . Shown are examples of age P30 retinal sections from 849 + / + , P23H - RFP / + heterozygous ( het ) , and P23H - RFP / P23H - RFP homozygous ( homo ) mice 850 with TUNEL + nuclei ( green ) within the DAPI stained nuclei of the ONL ( blue ) . RFP fluorescence 851 is magenta . ( D ) Time course plot of aggregate TUNEL + nuclei / mm 2 measurements among all 852 genotypes at multiple time points . Statistical comparisons among groups were performed using 853 unpaired t - tests . At P14 , homo retinas have statistically more TUNEL + nuclei compared to both 854 + / + ( * P = 0 . 0167 ) and het ( * * P = 0 . 0098 ) retinas . At P30 , het retinas have statistically more 855 TUNEL + nuclear compared to + / + retinas ( * P = 0 . 042 ) , but the rate of TUNEL + nuclei between 856 het and + / + retinas is not statistically different at age P90 ( P = 0 . 312 ) . 857 Figure 8 . mRNA levels of ER stress and Unfolded Protein Response markers are near 858 normal in P23H - RFP / + heterozygous retinas at postnatal day 30 .

( A - B ) Conventional transmission electron 866 microscopy ( TEM ) images of rod photoreceptor neurons at age P14 from either ( A ) + / + or ( B ) 867 P23H - RFP / + heterozygous ( het ) mice . In each example rod , the inner segment ( IS ) is outlined 868 with yellow lines . The IS max width in P14 P23H - RFP / + rods is significantly greater than + / + 869 rods ( het : 2 . 967 µm ± 0 . 508 µm ( standard deviation , sd ) ( n = 14 ) vs + / + : 1 . 974 ± 0 . 481 µm ( sd ) 870 ( n = 19 ) , P < 0 . 0001 , unpaired t - test ) . Ectopic stacks of IS membranes in the swollen P23H - 871 RFP / + IS are marked with magenta arrows . Double - membraned autophagy compartments are 872 marked with magenta asterisks in the mutant P23H - RFP / + IS . In magnified views of example 873 connecting cilia ( CC ) from each genotype , the length of the CC – measured by the densely 874 stained CC membrane – is indicated . In aggregate , the length of the CC in P23H - RFP / + rods is 875 significantly greater than + / + CC ( het : 1 . 548 µm ± 0 . 206 µm ( sd ) ( n = 13 ) vs + / + : 1 . 27 µm ± 0 . 247 876 µm ( sd ) ( n = 11 ) , P = 0 . 0066 , unpaired t - test ) . ( C ) At age P30 , the ectopic IS membranes in 877 P23H / + rods appear more dysmorphic compared to P14 ( magenta arrows ) . In addition , some 878 outer segments disc membranes within or adjacent to P23H - RFP / + rods with IS defects are also 879 disrupted and appear dysmorphic ( green arrows ) . ( D ) In examples of the CC and basal OS 880 regions of P30 P23H / + rods , the structure of the CC and basal body remain intact despite being 881 adjacent to ectopic IS membranes ( magenta arrows ) ; however , there is evidence that basal OS 882 disc morphogenesis is disrupted possibly due to OS axoneme instability ( green arrows ) . 883 Figure 10 .

( A - B ) Confocal z - projection images of a retinal cryosection from P14 885 52 P23H - RFP / + and + / + littermate mice , immunolabeled for either the ER lumenal marker 886 BiP / GRP78 ( green ) ( A ) or the Golgi marker GM130 ( green ) ( B ) . P23HhRhoRFP fluorescence is 887 magenta . Co - localized BiP with RFP + aggregates in the P14 P23H - RFP / + retina section is 888 marked with white arrows . GM130 + Golgi membranes do not co - localize with RFP + aggregates 889 and appear unaffected in the P14 P23H - RFP / + retina compared to + / + sections . ( C ) SIM z - 890 projection images of a retina cryosection from an age P30 P23H - RFP / + mouse that is 891 immunolabeled for BiP ( green ) and centrin ( white ) , which labels the connecting cilium ( CC ) and 892 basal body ( BB ) . RFP fluorescence is magenta . In a magnified inner segment ( IS ) , BiP 893 colocalization with a P23HhRhoRFP aggregate is marked with white arrows . BiP + ER near the 894 cilium that is not colocalized with RFP is marked with yellow arrows . ( D ) Within the same SIM 895 images , the BiP + ER tightly surrounds a P23HhRhoRFP aggregate ( white arrows ) . ( E ) In age 896 P30 + / + SIM control images , BiP immunolabeling marks the inner segment ER network that 897 leads to the cilium .

KDEL puncta are more diffuse than BiP , but the localization pattern in the IS is 900 similar ; KDEL co - localization with the P23H - RFP aggregates ( white arrows ) and KDEL + ER 901 near the basal body that is not associated with RFP ( yellow arrows ) are labeled . ( G ) In age P30 902 + / + SIM control images , KDEL immunolabeling ( green ) labels puncta throughout the inner 903 segment . ( H ) SIM images of a P23H - RFP / + retina cryosection at age P30 immunolabeled for 904 GM130 , a Golgi membrane marker ( green ) , along with centrin ( white ) and RFP ( magenta ) . 905 Overall , The Golgi is proximally localized to the RFP + aggregates at P30 , but in some examples 906 the Golgi network reaches the centrin + cilium . On a subcellular scale , the Golgi membranes are 907 generally segregated from RFP aggregates ( yellow arrows ) , but small pieces of Golgi 908 membrane are found co - localized with some RFP aggregates ( white arrows ) . ( I ) In age P30 + / + 909 SIM control images of retinal cryosections , the Golgi is predominantly dissociated from the cilia ; 910 however , examples of + / + rods with GM130 + Golgi membrane networks that reach the basal 911 53 body are shown . Gray dotted arrows throughout mark a region that is magnified from the same 912 image . 913 914 Figure 11 . Localization of P23HhRh - RFP protein with the ER in the outer plexiform layer 915 ( OPL ) of P23H - RFP / + retinas . ( A ) A SIM z - projection image of a P23H - RFP / + retinal 916 cryosection , age P30 , immunolabeled for BiP / GRP78 to label the ER ( green ) in the OPL and 917 surrounding area . P23HRhoRFP protein ( magenta ) fills the rod photoreceptor synapses in this 918 region . BiP + ER labeling is present throughout the OPL and the outer nuclear layer ( ONL ) . In a 919 magnified view of a pair of synapses , P23HhRhoRFP protein is co - localized with the BiP + ER 920 staining . ( B ) In a similar SIM magnified view of a P30 P23H - RFP / + retina section 921 immunostained for KDEL ( green ) , P23HRhoRFP protein is also co - localized with KDEL + ER 922 staining . ( C ) As a control SIM image , a P30 P23H - RFP / + retina section is immunostained for 923 GM130 to label Golgi . No Golgi membranes are evident in the OPL ; however , they are present 924 in the inner nuclear layer ( INL ) . 925 926 60 References 937 1 . Daiger SP , Sullivan LS , Bowne SJ .
