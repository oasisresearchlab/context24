Here we show that this site - speciﬁc integration system also functions efﬁciently in Drosophila melanogaster in cul - tured cells and in embryos . Intramolecular recombination in S2 cells on transfected plasmid DNA carrying the attB and attP recognition sites occurred at a frequency of 47 % . In addition , several endogenous pseudo attP sites were identiﬁed in the ﬂy genome that were recognized by the integrase and used as substrates for integration in S2 cells . Two lines of Drosophila were created by integrating an attP site into the genome with a P element . φ C31 integrase injected into embryos as mRNA functioned to promote integration of an attB - containing plasmid into the attP site , resulting in up to 55 % of fertile adults producing transgenic offspring . A total of 100 % of these progeny carried a precise integration event at the genomic attP site . These experiments demonstrate the potential for precise genetic engineering of the Drosophila genome with the φ C31 integrase system and will likely beneﬁt research in Drosophila and other insects .

Only ﬂies with integrated pUASTB ( Figure 1F ) plasmid . Both lines 1781 φ C31 Integrase in Drosophila pigmented eyes were analyzed by Southern blot , but of a new P - element line per transgene , so the P - element transgenic frequency must also be taken into account . these ﬂies may have carried integrations at both attP sites or just one . Once an attP - containing line has been made , no further P - element transformation is required with the φ C31 sys - tem . The φ C31 integrase system allows researchers to DISCUSSION place any number of genes easily into the same chromo - somal context , which can be essential for studies in The ability of the φ C31 integrase to perform unidirec - tional site - speciﬁc recombination in cell types from E . which small changes in expression will affect the results . This system will beneﬁt researchers who rely on P - ele - coli to human cells led us to hypothesize that the system would likely function in Drosophila . The integrase has ment transformation in ﬂies by decreasing the number of injections that are required , allowing multiple genes indeed shown efﬁcient recombination in Drosophila S2 cells , as well as in vivo in Drosophila embryos . Intramo - to be integrated into the same chromosomal context and providing an easy PCR screen for insertions . The lecular recombination occurred in S2 tissue culture cells at a frequency of (cid:1) 50 % and in embryos at frequencies ability of φ C31 integrase to mediate recombination in D . melanogaster makes it likely that the enzyme will work of 88 – 100 % . We have shown that the φ C31 integrase can reproduci - well in other insects . This development should help insect research as a whole , including the ﬁght against bly produce transgenic Drosophila in the range of 43 – 56 % of fertile adults at previously inserted attP sites .

The φ C31 integrase system continues to prove itself as a versatile site - speciﬁc frequency is higher than the intermolecular integration frequency that has been demonstrated with the φ C31 integration tool for the genetic engineering of a wide variety of organisms . integrase in mammalian cells ( Groth et al . 2000 ) .
