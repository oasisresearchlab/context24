Models for cell morphogenesis postulate that the effects of turgor pressure and mechanical properties of the cell wall can explain the shapes of these diverse cell types [ 1 – 6 ] . However , in general , these models await validation through quantitative experiments . Fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe are rod - shaped cells that grow by tip extension and then divide medi - ally through formation of a cell wall septum . Upon cell separation after cytokinesis , the new cell ends adopt a rounded morphology . Here , we show that this shape is generated by a very simple mechanical - based mechanism in which turgor pressure inﬂates the elastic cell wall in the absence of cell growth . This process is independent of actin and new cell wall synthesis . To model this morphological change , we ﬁrst estimate the mechanical properties of the cell wall using several approaches . The lateral cell wall behaves as an isotropic elastic material with a Young’s modulus of 50 ± 10 MPa inﬂated by a turgor pressure estimated to be 1 . 5 ± 0 . 2 MPa . Based upon these parameters , we develop a quantitative me - chanical - based model for new end formation that reveals that the cell wall at the new end expands into its characteristic rounded shape in part because it is softer than the mature lateral wall . These studies provide a simple example of how turgor pressure expands the elastic cell wall to generate a particular cell shape . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Morphogenesis of the New End Is Likely to Be a Purely Mechanical Process Fission yeast cells serve as an attractive model for eukaryotic morphogenesis because of their highly regular and simple rod - shape and growth patterns [ 7 ] . These cells have a capsule - like shape with rounded cell ends , similar to E . coli and many other rod - shaped cells [ 1 ] . S . pombe are approximately 4 m m in diam - eter and grow by tip extension to 14 m m in length before dividing medially [ 8 , 9 ] . Cells are encased in a ﬁbrillar cell wall that is composed primarily of b - and a - glucans and galactomannan [ 10 , 11 ] . For cytokinesis , an actin - based contractile ring guides the assembly of a cell wall septum , which is composed of a cen - tral primary septum ( PS ) disc ﬂanked by two secondary septa ( SS ) [ 9 , 12 – 15 ] . Following completion of the septum , the PS and edging are then digested away by endoglucanases for cell separation [ 16 ] . During cell separation , the daughter cells snap apart abruptly ( ‘‘rupture’’ event ) , and then the resultant two new ends ( NEs ) adopt a rounded shape within minutes ( Fig - ure 1A ; Movie S1 ) . This shape change can be measured by the amount of bulging from original position of ﬂat septum disc ( s value ; Figure 1A ) . The s value rises and plateaus to s 1 = 1 : 43±0 : 25 m m ( n = 8 cells ) in about 10 min after the rupture ( t = 0 ) . While the old end ( OE ) begins to grow again soon after the rupture , NE does not start to elongate till generally about 40 min later , when cells initiate polarized cell growth at NE in a process known as ‘‘new end take off’’ ( NETO ) . An important unresolved question is whether shaping of the new end is accomplished through active cell wall remodeling that requires actin and polarity factors , or whether it is formed by a mechanical process [ 13 , 14 ] . An initial indication that the rounded shape might be formed through a purely mechanical process was seen in laser microsurgery experiments [ 17 ] . In cells with a complete septum , we cut the lateral cell wall in one of the cellular compartments ( Figure 1B ; Movie S2 ) . The cut compart - ment shrank and extruded cellular contents , while the other cellular compartment stayed intact . Interestingly , the septum bulged out toward the lysed part of the cell to form a rounded shape similar to that of a NE . Time - lapse imaging showed that the deformation occurred extremely quickly ( in less than 10 ms ) with an outward speed > 1 m m / sec ( three orders of magni - tude faster than the normal rate of cell growth ) . This shape change occurred similarly in cells treated with the 200 m M latrun - culin A ( LatA ) ( Figure 1C ) , which leads to rapid depolymerization of all F - actin in minutes and cessation of growth [ 18 – 20 ] . Thus , this bulging of septum is actin independent . Similar deformation of the septum has also been observed in cell wall mutants [ 13 , 14 ] . These initial observations suggest that the larger turgor pressure in the intact compartment is able to push out the septum cell wall into a curved shape . We tested whether a similar mechanism shapes the NE during cell separation . We propose that before cell separation , the septum is initially ﬂat because forces from the turgor pressure on both sides balance each other , but when the cells begin to separate , turgor pressure pushes out of the cell wall to form the rounded new cell end . This shape change involves an approximately 65 % increase in the surface area at the new 2150 Current Biology 25 , 2150 – 2157 , August 17 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved end . This increase is due to expansion of the new end cell wall , and not from ﬂow of the lateral cell wall , as indicated by stable position of birthmarks on the cell wall . To test whether this pro - cess requires actin , we treated septated cells with LatA and fol - lowed them by time - lapse imaging . 80 % of the cells ( n = 30 ) divided and separated , with the NEs forming rounded shapes with similar extent and kinetics as control cells ( n = 13 cells ; Fig - ure 1D ) . We conﬁrmed that the LatA treatment was effective in inhibiting F - actin and polarized cell growth ( Figure S1 ) . We tested the role of wall synthesis by treating septated cells with the b - glucan synthase inhibitor caspofungin [ 21 ] . At 20 m g / ml caspo - fungin , cells exhibit ﬁve times slower tip growth , and many cells lyse . However , most septated cells continued to separate , and those that do formed rounded NEs with a similar extent and time - scale as untreated cells ( n = 12 cells ; Figure 1E ) . Staining with calcoﬂuor and blankophor , which preferentially labels newly deposited cell wall [ 8 , 10 , 22 ] , further suggests that there is little or no wall growth on the NE during cell separation . These ﬁnd - ings support a model in which turgor pressure simply deforms the ﬂat cell wall to a rounded shape without wall growth . The Fission Yeast Cell Wall Behaves as an Isotropic Elastic Material To evaluate cell wall shaping mechanism ( s ) in a quantitative manner , we next sought to determine the elastic properties of the cell wall and turgor pressure . To construct a mechanistic model , we approximate the ﬁssion yeast cells as a capsule - shaped thin elastic shell inﬂated by internal turgor pressure ( Figure 2A ) . A pressure difference , D P , stretches the cell wall to its ‘‘natural state . ’’ Without pressure , the tensionless cell wall is in ‘‘relaxed state . ’’ We deﬁne the expansion ratio in width as % R (cid:1) h ð R 1 (cid:3) R 0 Þ = R 0 3 100 and the expansion ratio in length A B C D E Figure 1 .

R 1 and R 0 are the radii in natural and relaxed state respectively , and similarly for L 1 and L 0 . We assume that cell wall is an elastic material with Young’s modulus Y r in circumferential direction , Y l in longitudinal direction , and that Poisson’s ratio is zero in both directions . Crude force balance equations yield the connection between the expansion ratios and the physical parameters of the system as ( Supplemental Experimental Procedures section 1 ) : R 1 (cid:3) R 0 R 0 3 100 = % R (cid:1) y D PR 1 Y r t 3 100 L 1 (cid:3) L 0 L 0 3 100 = % L (cid:1) y D PR 1 2 Y l t 3 100 : Since the thickness of the wall , t = 0 : 2 m m , and the radius of the cell , R 1 = 1 : 92±0 : 07 m m , are known , D P = Y r and D P = Y l can be found if one can measure % R (cid:1) and % L (cid:1) experimentally . To measure these expansion ratios , we devised approaches to release turgor pressure . First , we locally cut the cell wall using laser microsurgery . Time - lapse imaging showed that cells shrink rapidly by approximately 17 % in width and 9 % in length ( see Movie S3 and Figure 2B , left ) . This corresponds to expansion ratios of 20 % ±5 % and 10 % ±3 % , respectively . We also lysed cells by ( 1 ) micro - manipulation with a glass needle , ( 2 ) dehydra - tion / rehydration , and ( 3 ) post - osmotic - shock ( see Supplemental Experimental Procedures ) . These approaches all produced A B D C E Figure2 .

Bottom graph shows ratios between expansion ratios . For ghosts , the length expansion ratio cannot be measured since the prior geometry of the cells is not known . ( D ) Dimensions of individual cells exposed to various sorbitol concentrations were measured . Graphs show experimental and theoretical osmotic response ratios for length ( % L h ð L 1 (cid:3) L x Þ = L x 3 100 ) and width ( % R h ð R 1 (cid:3) R x Þ = R x 3 100 ) where L x and R x are dimensions after the shrinkage . b is the water inaccessible volume fraction . ( E ) Ratio between the response ratios . Scale bars , 4 m m . similar expansion ratios ( Figure 2C ) . The lysed cells , however , retain intracellular contents that may exert some internal pressure or force onto the cell wall . There - fore , we next isolated cell wall ‘‘ghosts’’ that lack intracellular structures by breaking yeast cells ( Figure 2B , right ; Figure S2A ) . Although we could not measure changes in cell length in these broken cell walls , the changes in cell width show that ghosts shrink slightly more than the lysed cells , indicating that the lysed cells still maintain some low level of internal pressure . The corre - sponding expansion ratio of the width in ghosts is 24 % ±5 % ( Figure 2C ) . A signiﬁcant outcome of our experiments is that the yeast cell wall is isotropic . For a cylindrical shell , % R (cid:1) = % L (cid:1) = 2 Y l = Y r . If the cell wall has the same stiffness in circumferential and longitudinal directions ( i . e . , Y r = Y l = Y ) , then % R (cid:1) = % L (cid:1) is predicted to be 2 . Our experimental measurements produced a ratio very close to 2 ( Figure 2C , bottom graph ) . This behavior is different from that of the E . coli cell wall , for instance , in which cell wall ﬁbers are oriented circumferentially and are anisotropic in stiffness [ 23 , 24 ] . Taking the expansion ratio of the ghosts for the width ( 24 % ) , we found that D P Y = ð % R (cid:1) Þ t R 1 = 1 40±8 : This relationship indicates that the value of Young’s modulus is about 40 times cell turgor pressure ( they both carry the same units ) . Equations stated for % R (cid:1) and % L (cid:1) are derived through crude force balance relations .

( legend continued on next page ) Current Biology 25 , 2150 – 2157 , August 17 , 2015 ª 2015 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved 2153 result , we have included the higher order terms in our formulas by applying a continuum mechanical approach ( Supplemental Experimental Procedures section 1 ) , which yields Y = D P = 33±8 . Osmotic Responses Show that Fission Yeast Is Inﬂated by High MPa Turgor Pressure Next , to further characterize the mechanical properties of the cells , we measured how cells shrink in different doses of sorbitol in the media ( see Supplemental Experimental Procedures ) . To estimate the turgor pressure , we sought to determine the external molarity , c 0 , required to shrink intact cells to the size of their ghosts ( i . e . , the relaxed wall state ) ; see Figure 2D . Sorbi - tol shift curves show that on average , c 0 z 1 : 5 M ( = 1 . 3 M sorbitol in the growth medium , YE5S ) . To estimate the pressure from this result , we applied an osmotic theory that takes into account the expansion ratios , the water inaccessible volume , and the matrix potential of the solutions ( see Supplemental Experimental Procedures section 3 ) . The assumptions of the theory are taken such that it would yield the minimal plausible value for the pressure . We found the turgor pressure ( the osmotic pressure difference between inside and outside of the cell ) as D P = 1 : 5±0 : 2 MPa . Given our previous ﬁnding that Y = D P = 33±8 , this yields the Young’s modulus ( stiffness ) of the cell wall as Y = 50±10 MPa . The response ratios of cells ﬁt well with the theoretically calculated osmotic responses ( Figure 2D ) . The data suggest a water inaccessible volume fraction of b = 0 : 22 . The ratios be - tween the response ratios ( % R = % L ) in width and length are again close to 2 , showing that the cell wall material is isotropic ( Figure 2E ) . To address a concern that results may be affected by cellular adaptation mechanisms to osmotic changes , we also analyzed gpd1 D ( glycerol - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ) mutants , which are deﬁcient in restoring turgor pressure during osmotic shifts [ 25 , 26 ] . The osmotic response ratios of gpd1 D mutants ( Figures 1D and 1E ) were similar to those of wild - type cells . We also used spheroplast formation as an alternative approach to estimate c 0 because of its importance for applica - tion of a reliable osmotic theory . Upon removal of the cell wall , spheroplasts remained intact at external molarities c 0 = 1 : 2 (cid:3) 1 : 7 M ( Figures S2B – S2D ) . This result is consistent with the osmotic shift experiment that showed c 0 z 1 : 5 M ( Figure 2D ) . Mechanical Forces Can Account for the Shape of the New End Having estimated of the properties of the cell wall , we next em - barked on testing and analyzing the mechanism for NE formation based upon the effects of turgor pressure on the cell wall . We developed a ﬁnite element simulation program based on non - linear continuum mechanics principles . Our algorithm relies upon the deformation of a given surface under a speciﬁed force ﬁeld ( or pressure ) . The surface is discretized with triangular ele - ments , and the elastic energies are calculated through stretch as well as bending terms ( Supplemental Experimental Procedures section 2 . 1 ) . We validated our program by comparisons to known analytic solutions ( Supplemental Experimental Proce - dures section 2 . 2 – 5 ) and also veriﬁed our previous analytic work on expansion ratios ( Supplemental Experimental Proce - dures section 2 . 6 ) . In simulations , we inﬂate a closed cylindrical shell ( Supplemental Experimental Procedures section 2 . 7 ) . We assume that , before cell separation , the septum is at a relaxed ﬂat geometry , as opposed to the lateral wall , which is expanded under stress ; buckling of the septum in sorbitol - treated cells supports this assumption ( Figure S3A ) . We assume that the wall at the NE is also an isotropic material with a constant uniform elasticity and zero Poisson’s ratio but could have a different thickness and elasticity . The shapes from simulations are depen - dent on Y = D P ratio and therefore are independent of D P . Note that we extract Y through Y = D P , which is found through experi - mentally measured parameters . Our simulations successfully yielded the rounded shape of the NE ( Figure 3A ) . This modeling allowed us to estimate elastic properties of the NE cell wall simply by the extent of its bulging . Published electron micrographs show that the thickness of the secondary septum ( t s = 100±20 nm ) is about the half that of the lateral wall ( t s = t y 0 : 5 ) [ 13 , 14 , 16 , 27 – 31 ] . In addition , there may be chemical and structural differences between the two types of cell walls [ 14 , 32 ] . We simulated the NE bulging for varying values of Young’s modulus of the SS ( Y s ) by using the values found for D P and Y ( Figure 3A ) . This plot showed that the best ﬁt to the measured s 1 = 1 : 42±0 : 15 m m ( n = 30 cells ) is at around Y s = Y = 0 : 48 ; SDs in s 1 and t s measurements yielded error mar - gins of 0 : 3 < Y s = Y < 0 : 7 . This leads to the conclusion that Y s y Y = 2 ; cell wall stiffness of the NE is about half of that of the lateral wall ( i . e . , twice as soft ) . Next , we tested the effect of turgor pressure on the shape of the NE in simulations and experiments . In simulations , both cell width and the extent of NE bulging ( s value ) positively corre - late with the increasing pressure ( Figure 3B ) . We then compared these results with effects of altering the turgor pressure in a series of experiments . First , we used micromanipulation to measure the intact , lysed , and ghost states of individual cells ( Figure 3C ) . Compared to the NEs of intact cells , the NEs of the corresponding ghosts bulged less ( smaller s value ) and ( B ) Simulation of a whole cell at varying values of pressure D P where Y = 50 MPa and Y s = Y = 2 = 25 MPa .

( D ) Averaged NE shapes ( from C ; n = 8 cells ) were ﬁtted to an ellipse - rectangle combination and compared to simulation outputs ( blue dots ) . Note that the NE in ghosts does not return to a completely ﬂat geometry ( Figure S3B ) because of the shrinkage of the lateral cell wall , as also seen in the simulations . The slight discrepancies ( maximum error < 0 . 2 m m ) between the ghost proﬁles could be due to additional structural features between the septum and lateral wall not included in the simulations [ 12 ] .

We further tested the effect of turgor pressure experimentally by adding sorbitol to the live , dividing cells ( Figure 3E ) . First we added 1 . 3 M sorbitol to cells that have just divided ( < 1 min after rupture ) . The cells shrank as expected , and the process of cell separation halted with the NEs ﬂat ( Figure 3E ; middle images ) . Thus , turgor pressure is needed for cell separation and shaping of NE . However , in these experiments , one reason why the NEs are ﬂat could be because the sister cells are still attached by the PS ( see below ) . Hence , in another set of experiments , to elimi - nate the effects of the PS , we added the sorbitol just after the A C B D E Figure 4 .

Upon sorbitol treatment , the shape of the NEs changed from a rounded to a ﬂattened shape . Interestingly , OEs maintained a rounded shape . Curvature decreased at NEs , while it increased at OEs ( n = 8 cells , bar plot in Figure 3E ) . These behaviors were as predicted in simulations that assumed that OE wall properties are similar to that of the lateral wall ( Figures 3B and 3E ) . These ﬁndings demonstrate that the two ends of ﬁssion yeast cell are mechanically different . Following the initial shrinkage , the cells in sorbitol gradually re - inﬂated over 60 min back to normal dimensions ( Figures 3E and 3F ) . This is likely due to cellular adaptation to osmotic stress , which gradually restores the relative internal pressure [ 33 ] . During this recovery period , the width of the cells increased with increasing pressure , without any apparent tip growth ( Fig - ure S3C ) . Thus , these time - lapse images allow us to determine the resultant cell morphology over a continuous range of turgor pressure . In Figure 3G , we plot s values versus the width of the cells ( as the measure of turgor pressure ) from the sorbitol shift and the micromanipulation experiments and compared them to simulations ; all show a similar , strong positive correla - tion . The agreement of our simulations with experimental data provides quantitative evidence for the role of turgor pressure in the shaping of NE . Mechanical Forces Shape the Septum during Cell Separation and Septum Bulging During cell separation , the shape of the NE develops gradually over minutes . An additional factor governing this process is the PS , which acts as an adhesive that holds the sister cells together . The PS is a disc about 50 nm thick ( one - fourth the thickness of the lateral wall t p y t = 4 ) [ 13 , 14 , 16 , 27 – 31 ] ; however , its mechan - ical properties are unknown . After initial rupture , the PS gradually shrinks in diameter ( D ) , and the bulging of the SS ( s 4 value ) gradually increases as the NE adopts a rounded shape ( Figures 4A – 4C ; Movie S5 ) . In simulations ( Supplemental Experimental Procedures section 2 . 8 ) , we assumed that the PS is mechani - cally inﬁnitely strong and stiff in the transverse direction ( perpen - dicular to the disc ) but could be elastic in the lateral direction ( direction along surface ) with a uniform and constant Young’s modulus of Y p . We plotted s 4 as function of D over a range of Y p values ( Figure 4C ) . The outputs agreed with the experimental data when Y s = Y = 2 and 0 % Y p % Y . These ﬁndings suggest that the PS is an elastic material in the lateral direction with a stiffness < 2 Y and stretches along with the SS during cell separation . In contrast , simulations with Y s = Y for any value of Y p failed to ﬁt to experimental data . Thus , these results validate our model further and explain the evolving morphology of NE during cell separation . Finally , we applied our simulation to the laser cut experiments of fully septated cells ( Figures 1B and 4D ) , in which the turgor pressure is thought to immediately deform the septum cell wall . In these cells , the deformation of the septum ( s 5 ) was less than the one of the NE in normally dividing cells ( s 1 ) ( Figure 4E ) . We tested whether this shape difference could be explained by the difference between single layered wall of the NE versus the thicker triple - layered wall of the septum . In simulations ( Supple - mental Experimental Procedures section 2 . 9 ) , we examined septum deformation at Y s = Y = 2 at different values of Y P . The case Y p = Y produced the best ﬁt ( Figure 4E ) , which is consistent with the estimate from cell - separation experiments ( Figure 4C ) , providing an independent validation of our results . Thus , our ﬁndings using experiments and simulations in a variety of con - texts demonstrate that a mechanically based mechanism based upon turgor pressure and elastic properties of the cell wall can quantitatively account for shaping of the NE . In summary , we develop a quantitative model for morphogen - esis of a rounded cell end in a rod - shaped cell . Our ﬁndings suggest that the rounded shape is produced simply by turgor pressure inﬂating the elastic cell wall , even without cell wall growth . Our measurements of mechanical properties are gener - ally on the same order of magnitude as previous ones in ﬁssion yeast and other fungi obtained through a variety of approaches [ 26 , 34 , 35 ] . One advance in this study is in the direct measure - ments of the relaxed state of the wall that allow us to determine critical parameters needed to apply a reliable osmotic theory . To adopt its rounded shape , the cell wall at the new end is 50 % thinner and 50 % softer than the lateral wall , and stretches 65 % in area . These mechanical properties of the cell wall may explain why cell wall mutants lyse primarily at cell separation [ 36 ] . Turgor pressure may not only drive shape changes , but also contribute to the separation of the sister cells and their movement apart . Forces from turgor pressure also contribute to growth and shaping of the growing cell end , but this process is more complex as it involves addition and remodeling of the cell wall [ 1 , 3 , 26 ] . Turgor pressure is also thought to drive cell - shape changes in certain plant cells , such as guard cells that regulate the opening and closing of stomatal pores [ 37 ] . It will be inter - esting to examine whether similar mechanically based mecha - nisms are responsible for generating the rounded contours of new ends after cytokinesis in other cell types . Our studies illustrate how mechanical as well as molecular agents underlie cellular morphogenesis .
