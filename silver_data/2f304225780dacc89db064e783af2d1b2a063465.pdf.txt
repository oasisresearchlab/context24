Many public health responses and modeled scenarios for COVID - 19 outbreaks caused by SARS - CoV - 2 assume that infection results in an immune response that protects individuals from future infections or illness for some amount of time . The timescale of protection is a critical determinant of the future impact of the pathogen . The presence or absence of protective immunity due to infection or vaccination ( when available ) will affect future transmission and illness severity . The dynamics of immunity and nature of protection are relevant to discussions surrounding therapeutic use of convalescent sera as well as efforts to identify individuals with protective immunity . Here , we review the scientific literature on antibody immunity to coronaviruses , including SARS - CoV - 2 as well as the related SARS - CoV - 1 , MERS - CoV and human endemic coronaviruses ( HCoVs ) . We reviewed 1281 abstracts and identified 322 manuscripts relevant to 5 areas of focus : 1 ) antibody kinetics , 2 ) correlates of protection , 3 ) immunopathogenesis , 4 ) antigenic diversity and cross - reactivity , and 5 ) population seroprevalence . While studies of SARS - CoV - 2 are necessary to determine immune responses to it , evidence from other coronaviruses can provide clues and guide future research . .

Limited pre - existing immunity to this virus is thought to be responsible for the explosive increase in cases across the world . Nearly all transmission models of SARS - CoV - 2 assume that infection produces immunity to reinfection for durations of at least one year 1 – 3 . This assumption is relevant to public health officials implementing and managing various non - pharmaceutical interventions , the utility of sera from infected individuals as a therapeutic 4 , and the ability for serological tests to identify those who are immune 5 . The dynamics of immunity will also affect the performance of serological testing to quantify the extent of infection in populations . However , knowledge of the dynamics and nature of immune response to SARS - CoV - 2 infection is limited , and the scientific basis for durable immunity , upon which these key public health and clinical strategies are dependent , is not well developed . Several authors have noted human experimental infection studies ( called human challenge studies ) suggesting that protection after coronavirus infections may last only 1 or 2 years 6 – 9 . HCoVs have been used in human challenge experiments since shortly after their discovery in 1965 10 , 11 . These experiments , where individuals were intentionally infected with HCoV , provide some of the clearest characterization of human responses to coronaviruses and the potential for immune responses to limit infection and disease . Multiple human challenge studies measured antibody immunity before a coronavirus challenge and identified antibody responses that were associated with protection from infection , serological response or symptom 12 . The low severity of HCoV allowed for safe use of these viruses in human challenge experiments . The greater likelihood of severe illness in SARS - CoV - 2 limits the applicability of such experiments , although some have argued for their use in subsets of the population 13 . The duration of immunity of SARS - CoV - 2 will dictate the overall course of the pandemic and the post - pandemic dynamics 7 , and so an understanding of the temporal dynamics of protective immunity is critical . As with other introductions of novel pathogens 14 , explosive outbreaks of SARS - CoV - 2 across the globe may threaten its persistence by reducing the number of available hosts susceptible to infection . Immune interactions with endemic coronaviruses could theoretically affect the short - and long - term dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 , and vice versa 15 , 16 through cross - protection or antibody - dependent enhancement 17 , but these interactions and effects are not yet understood . If SARS - CoV - 2 does become endemic , age - stratified seroprevalence studies of endemic coronaviruses may provide estimates for incidence rates in the presence of higher levels of population immunity . Here , we describe the results of a systematic review of the literature on antibody measures of immunity to coronaviruses , including endemic human coronaviruses ( principally HCoV - 229E , HCoV - HKU1 , HCoV - OC43 , HCoV - NL63 ) , SARS - CoV - 1 , MERS - CoV ( Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV ) and early work on SARS - CoV - 2 . We conceptualize the stages of exposure and infection at which immunity may play a role in the dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 , and how literature describing work on this and other coronaviruses can provide insights into these stages , as follows .

First , an exposure to a pathogen generates an immune response that changes over time and between individuals ( antibody kinetics ) . Upon exposure , infection history might play a role in providing protection against new infection , and the literature can provide evidence for such correlates of protection through challenge studies and longitudinal cohort studies . Upon infection , an individual’s immune state , possibly impacted by pre - existing antibodies to other coronaviruses ( among other mechanisms ) , may cause harm through immunopathogenesis , and the literature on this topic primarily consists of in vitro experiments . Correlates of immunity ( or risk through immunopathogenesis ) are complicated by the existence of multiple genera of coronaviruses that are antigenically diverse and may provide cross - protection , and may also cause false positive assay results due to cross - reactivity . Finally , the preceding phenomena at the individual level interact to determine population seroprevalence . Studies that measure these quantities across different age groups can provide evidence , albeit ecological evidence , for or against proposed mechanisms of immunity at the individual level . Methods Search strategy and selection criteria We conducted searches of the PubMed database on March 20 , 2020 using the search term “coronavirus” and each of the following terms or phrases : “serolog * ” , “serop * ” , “cross reactivity” , and “complement fixation” . We also searched for each of these terms with the search terms “SARS” and “MERS” . Articles were included in the search regardless of publication date . Articles included electronic , ahead - of - print publications available in the PubMed database . We did not attempt to contact authors to obtain unpublished data . Each abstract was reviewed by two reviewers . Articles that were not considered applicable were excluded ( see below ) . Additionally , we identified articles that may be relevant from the reference list of other articles identified by our PubMed searches . Assessment Abstracts were classified as : 1 ) study of antibody immune responses to human coronavirus ; 2 ) study of human coronavirus but not about antibody immunity ; 3 ) study in non - humans or basic biological study of virus - antibody interactions not characterizing actual humans ; 4 ) study in humans not about coronavirus ; 5 ) in another language ; 6 ) duplicate of another record ; or 7 ) dead link / bad return / noise . Disagreement between two reviewers on classification was resolved by a third reviewer . Manuscripts classified in the first category ( study of antibody immune responses to human coronavirus ) were reviewed in their entirety and classified by one reviewer as relevant to one or more of the following : 1 ) antibody kinetics ; 2 ) correlates of protection ; 3 ) antigenic diversity and cross reactivity ; 4 ) immunopathogenesis ; and / or 5 ) population seroprevalence or incidence . Manuscripts that were not considered relevant to any of the preceding categories were excluded . .

Data are available at https : / / doi . org / 10 . 5281 / zenodo . 3751566 . Pooled Analyses We conducted pooled analyses in two areas where data were available and sufficiently comparable to include in a single analysis . Antibody kinetics and association of antibody responses with clinical severity We summarized approximate time to detection across studies for two sets of studies . The first set includes studies with cumulative number of positive cases over time . Each additional positive case added to the cumulative curve was assumed to be a new detected case at that time point . This is approximate only , because cumulative curves sometimes decline ( Figure S1 ) , indicating some participants were lost to follow - up . Second , we identified data that described either seropositivity as a function of time , or measures of antibodies with a reported cutoff . Data was included if ( i ) the first seropositive time point was within three weeks of illness onset or ( ii ) the first estimate ( s ) were negative , but a subsequent measurement within three weeks of the first was positive . Population seroprevalence We estimated the annual force of infection from age - stratified seroprevalence data , assuming that individuals acquire infection with a single , strain - specific force of infection that is constant in time using standard methods 18 , and that once an individual becomes seropositive they remain seropositive for the remainder of their lifetime ( regardless of their protective status ) . We estimated the total force of infection ( FOI ) from the four major endemic strains by drawing 100 , 000 bootstrap samples of four strain - specific FOIs and calculating the sum across strains . Age at first infection is given by the inverse of total FOI . Results Manuscript identification Our searches identified 1281 abstracts of potential relevance ( Figure 2 ) . Two reviewers read each abstract and identified 322 manuscripts for full review . Manuscripts were classified into our areas of focus . Below , we present the findings of our review for each area of focus . .

Assays we encountered in our review fell into two major categories ( Table S1 ) . The most commonly used assays were binding assays , including enzyme linked immunosorbent assays ( ELISA ) , immunofluorescence assays ( IFA ) , Western blots , hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) , and complement fixation ( CF ) . The second category of assays was neutralization assays . Neutralization assays are typically considered the gold standard for measuring functional antibody responses as they measure biological activity throughout the viral replication process . Researchers have used assays of both types to characterize antibody activity by antibody class ( i . e . IgG , IgM , IgA ) . As these antibodies are known to have different temporal dynamics , we reported when specific classes of antibodies were characterized in figures . If no characterization was specified , we reported the measures of antibody aggregated across all classes . The source of samples in the reviewed studies was almost exclusively serum samples . However , mucosal samples collected by swab or nasal washings were also reported . Antibody kinetics and association of antibody responses with clinical severity Initially , 56 studies were classified as relevant to antibody kinetics , and 40 as relevant to the association of antibody responses with clinical severity . Of these , 27 were selected after further review ( 4 on endemic HCoV , 10 on MERS - CoV , 11 on SARS - CoV - 1 , and 3 , including 2 non - peer - reviewed preprints , on SARS - CoV - 2 ) . Table S2 provides summaries of these studies . We digitized data from a subset of 22 studies that included sufficient detail on longitudinal antibody measurements ( Supplementary Data File S1 ) . 18 % of studies reported cumulative seroconversion only . 73 % of the digitized studies provided estimates during the first week after onset of symptoms , while 77 % had measurements at least one month after onset of symptoms . Antibody kinetics post infection In the studies we shortlisted , antibody responses to infecting coronaviruses were rarely reported during the acute phase of illness ( 1 - 7 days ) 19 – 22 . Many studies reported an immune response , characterized by a robust increment of antibody titers for HCoV - 229E , MERS - CoV , SARS - CoV - 1 , and SARS - CoV - 2 after the second or third weeks following the onset of illness 8 , 23 – 30 . Callow et al . 8 found similar dynamics in IgA and IgG across 10 individuals experimentally infected with HCoV - 229E : antibody levels increased after 8 days and peaked around 14 days , although significant variation between patients was reported . Yang et al . 31 , analyzing data across 67 patients , found higher positive rates of IgM against SARS - CoV - 1 than IgG during the first month . They further found that the proportion of patients who seroconverted for IgM peaked 30 days after onset , followed by a gradual decrease of IgM levels , while IgG levels peaked by week 25 31 . Another study on 30 SARS - CoV - 1 infected patients 32 detected seroconversion of IgG , IgM , and IgA at similar times , indicating that the earliest they reached a peak was on average 15 days . While it is currently too early to characterize how anti - SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies will change over prolonged periods of time , preliminary studies have analyzed antibody changes in recent .

Tan et al . 33 found that IgM was detected on day 7 and peaked on day 28 ( across 28 patients ) , and IgG appeared by day 10 and peaked on day 49 ( 45 patients ) , while Zhao et al . 34 determined that seroconversion among 173 patients took place at median times of 12 ( IgM ) , 14 ( IgG ) , and 11 ( neutralizing antibodies ) days . Multiple studies reported that while IgM and IgG titers increased during the first weeks following symptom onset , IgM levels gradually waned ( while remaining detectable ) for SARS - CoV - 1 and MERS - CoV in comparison to IgG levels about a month post follow - up 23 , 32 . Most studies that examined antibody kinetics over extended periods of time focused on IgG 32 , 35 – 40 . Callow et al . 8 found among experimental infections with HCoV - 229E that after peaks in IgG and IgA , antibody levels waned and between 11 weeks and 1 year post inoculation were at similar levels to those found in inoculated but uninfected patients . Other studies 35 , 40 reported detectable IgG levels in recovered MERS - CoV patients , respectively at five months and one year after illness onset , while another 31 detected IgG antibodies across 67 SARS - CoV - 1 patients after 82 weeks , the endpoint of the study . We found few studies that analyzed changes in antibody kinetics over the course of many years after illness onset 36 , 37 . Cao et al . 37 described similar long - term dynamics in IgG and neutralizing antibodies over the course of a 3 - year study on SARS - CoV - 1 : titers for both peaked at month 4 , and while they waned thereafter , 74 . 2 % and 83 . 9 % of patients had detectable levels of IgG and neutralizing antibodies , respectively , at month 36 . Correlation between severe disease and rise in post - infection antibody level Studies have increasingly explored a potential link between case severity and antibody response ; however , the available information analyzing the nature of this relationship is uneven across viruses . Several studies on MERS - CoV as well as the first preliminary analyses on SARS - CoV - 2 explicitly explore this connection , while fewer studies on endemic HCoVs and SARS CoV - 1 do so . Several studies found that cases of varying severity ( e . g . , asymptomatic , mild , and severe ) developed detectable antibodies against HCoV - 229E , SARS - CoV - 1 , SARS - CoV - 2 , and MERS - CoV 33 , 41 – 44 . One study 45 found that the rise in antibodies between acute and convalescent sera correlated positively with symptoms and clinical score in 15 patients experimentally infected with HCoV - 229E ( Table 1 ) . However , most studies of SARS - CoV - 1 did not report symptom severity , and evidence of differences in antibody responses among cases experiencing symptoms of different severity is inconclusive . SARS - CoV - 1 survivors with sequelae were found to have lower neutralizing antibodies than patients without sequelae 37 , although the same study otherwise found no significant differences in kinetics according to disease severity . Another study 39 found no evidence of difference in antibody responses between patients who survived or died . In MERS - CoV , on the other hand , Ko et al . 46 found that both seroconversion rate and peak antibody levels increased with disease severity , while Okba et al . 47 reported a robust response to severe infections as opposed to low or no seroconversion in asymptomatic and mild cases . Milder infections also appeared to be less likely to elicit serologic responses 47 , 48 , although Okba et al . suggests that seroconversion detection may depend on the antibodies being targeted . More severe cases were also found to have slower responses 24 , 27 ; 75 % of patients who died had not seroconverted by week 3 46 . Some authors have hypothesized 47 , 49 that seroconversion rates in severe cases may be associated with prolonged viral shedding , and that low antibody responses .

Another study 40 suggested that weaker antibody responses to endemic HCoVs ( specifically HCoV - 229E ) might be because these mainly infect the upper respiratory tract . Preliminary studies on SARS - CoV - 2 point to a possibly contrasting pattern to MERS - CoV : while IgM antibodies appear at the same time in severe and non - severe cases , IgG appears sooner in severe cases 33 . On the other hand , neutralizing antibody titers were higher in severe cases 34 . The distributions of time points at which antibodies were detected ( see Methods ) in the digitized data are shown in Figure 3 . The median time to detection was similar across different antibodies for SARS - CoV - 1 ( 12 days ; IQR 8 - 15 . 2 days ) and SARS - CoV - 2 ( 11 days ; IQR 7 . 25 - 14 days ) , but longer for MERS - CoV ( 16 days ; IQR 13 - 19 days ) . Severity appears to be associated with time to detection of IgM in MERS - CoV cases only ( 2 days longer ) , and IgG in both MERS - CoV and SARS - CoV - 2 ( 2 to 3 days longer for more severe cases ) . All data on time to seroconversion was based on symptomatic patients . No data were available for asymptomatic individuals . Figure 4 provides a broad sense for trajectories of antibodies ( also see Figures S2 and S3 ) . Most longer - term studies ( > 10 weeks ) were for MERS - CoV and reported IgG and neutralizing antibodies ; these showed the presence of IgG and neutralizing antibodies up to 60 weeks after symptom onset ( Figure 4 ) . The studies reporting symptom severity with longer - term data focused on MERS - CoV . Not all of these studies reported a cutoff for the assay used ; in those that did , two thirds of patients with mild symptoms had detectable or positive IgG antibodies at six months and one year , while all patients with severe symptoms had detectable IgG antibodies at the same points in time ( Table 1 ) . Correlates of protection Identification of a correlate of protection requires characterization of immune responses prior to a known exposure or period of risk in which infection or illness outcomes are characterized . In our review , we found that this level of detail was only present in human challenge experiments with HCoVs . We identified 18 studies in which volunteers were exposed to experimental infections with HCoV . Of these , 6 associated pre - infection antibody measurements with either virologic , serologic or illness outcomes upon experimental infection ( Table S4 ) . The earliest identified experimental infection study of coronaviruses found that 7 of 8 with neutralizing titer < 5 excreted virus after experimental exposure compared to only 1 of 4 with pre - exposure titer of 40 or greater 10 . Interestingly , this study is one of the few to report illness as a function of dose of viral inoculum given in the challenge experiment and suggests that those given higher doses ( > 10 1 . 2 TCD50 ) were more likely to experience colds ( 10 / 15 ) than those exposed to lower doses ( < 10 0 . 7 TCD50 ) ( 3 / 11 ) . Barrow et al . 50 found lower proportions of individuals with high neutralizing titer experienced ‘significant colds’ upon viral challenge than individuals with low titer . .

She found that multiple antibody responses were associated with reduced risk of infection , seroconversion , and symptomatic illness upon challenge . Individuals who seroconverted to the experimental viral exposure ( defined as a rise in ELISA IgG serum antibodies ) had significantly higher serum IgG , neutralizing antibodies , and nasal IgA . Serum and mucosal IgA were associated with the duration of viral shedding post experimental infection , with those shedding for 5 days or more having statistically significantly less mucosal IgA than those shedding less than 5 days ( 0 . 6 ng / ml versus 4 . 7 ng / ml , p < 0 . 01 ) . Serum neutralizing antibody was not found to be significantly associated with viral shedding duration . This study also showed protective associations of pre - infection serum neutralizing antibody , serum IgG and nasal IgA with clinical severity scores and nasal secretion weights ( a measure of severity of rhinorrhea symptoms ) . Another prospective study 51 reported detection of pre - existing neutralizing antibodies among medical students who had virus isolation ( 67 % , n = 8 / 12 ) or seroconversion to HCoV - 229E ( 25 % , n = 3 / 12 ) . Pre - existing neutralizing antibodies were inversely associated with increases in neutralizing antibodies after re - infection , but were not associated with reinfection events that were determined by CF seroconversion . Experimental re - infection or re - challenge Several studies exposed volunteers to two challenges of virus , some months apart . Reed re - challenged 6 volunteers who had been experimentally infected 8 - 12 months previously 9 . On the first challenge , all 6 developed symptoms and detectable viruses and 5 of 6 experienced significant rise in titer . In the second , 0 / 6 experienced illness , detectable virus or significant rise in titer . Callow et al re - challenged volunteers with the same dose of coronavirus , one year apart 8 . Of 9 volunteers who were infected in the first exposure , 6 ( 67 % ) were infected in the second exposure . However , none of these individuals developed respiratory illness symptoms and they experienced a mean duration of detectable virus of 2 days compared to a mean of 5 . 6 in the initial challenge . Cross - reactivity and antigenic diversity We identified 73 papers as related to cross - reactivity and / or antigenic diversity ( Table S5 ) . Of these studies , 43 were identified as highly important and were described in the text , and data was digitized from 7 studies ( Supplementary Data File S2 ) . General background for this area of focus : Genetic relationships of human coronaviruses and immunogenic proteins Within the Coronaviridae family , the Coronavirinae subfamily includes four distinct genera . The Alphacoronaviruses include two major human coronaviruses , HCoV - 229E and HCoV - NL63 . Multiple HCoV - 229E - like strains have also been characterized . The Betacoronaviruses are categorized into 4 lineages . Lineage A includes HCoV - OC43 and HCoV - HKU1 , Lineage B . CC - BY - NC - ND 4 . 0 International license It is made available under a author / funder , who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity . is the ( which was not peer - reviewed ) The copyright holder for this preprint . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 2020 . 04 . 14 . 20065771 doi : medRxiv preprint 11 includes SARS - CoV - 1 and SARS - CoV - 2 , Lineage C includes MERS - CoV and multiple bat coronaviruses , and lineage D contains coronaviruses thus far only identified in bats . HCoV - OC43 and HCoV - 229E are documented to cause common cold while the more recent strains ( HCoV - HKU1 and HCoV - NL63 ) infect both the upper and lower respiratory tract , resulting in more severe but rarely fatal disease 52 . Other CoVs have been associated with human disease , including enteric disease in infants and zoonotic infections from livestock , but seem rare and are not described here 9 , 53 – 58 . Coronaviruses have four structural proteins : the spike protein ( S ) , the nucleocapsid ( N ) , the envelope protein ( E ) and the membrane protein ( M ) 59 , 60 . The S protein , which protrudes from the virus envelope , is immunodominant and consists of two subunits : the S1 protein , which contains the receptor binding domain ( RBD ) and the S2 protein , which mediates cell membrane fusion 61 , 62 . The nucleocapsid protein , which is also immunogenic , is smaller than S , lacks a glycosylation site , and induces antibodies sooner than to S during infection , making it an attractive protein for diagnostic assay design 63 . Sequence homology for the N and S of SARS - CoV - 1 to other Betacoronaviruses is 33 - 47 % and 29 % , respectively , while homology to Alphacoronaviruses is lower ( 25 - 29 % homology to N and 23 - 25 % for S ) 63 . SARS - CoV - 2 is most similar to SARS - CoV - 1 , harboring sequence homology of 90 % in N and 76 % in S followed by MERS - CoV ( 48 % and 35 % , respectively ) 64 . Natural and experimental infection studies in humans point to cross - reactivity within but minimal reactivity between endemic human Alpha - and Betacoronaviruses . Individuals experimentally inoculated with HCoV - 229E and HCoV - 229E - like strain LP experienced a > 4 - fold rise in neutralizing antibodies to both HCoV - 229E and LP , while individuals inoculated with HCoV - OC43 did not 65 . However , while volunteers experimentally inoculated with HCoV - 229E - like strains were protected against challenge with the homologous strain at one year ( n = 6 / 6 ; none shed virus , showed symptoms , or had a rise in antibodies ) , volunteers experienced only partial protection against heterologous HCoV - 229E - like strains ( n = 5 / 12 protected ) . Increasing population immunity to HCoV - 229E in the population was associated with less clinical disease upon challenge with HCoV - 229E - like strains 9 . Studies of serological responses to HCoV N proteins point to cross - reactivity within Alpha - HCoVs ( 229E and NL63 ) and Beta - HCoVs ( OC43 and HKU1 ) but not between Alpha - and Beta - HCoVs 66 – 68 . Consistent with observations in human challenge studies , children experiencing natural HCoV infections experience 4 - fold seroconversions to either HCoV - OC43 or HCoV - 229E but not both simultaneously 69 . However , a longitudinal study in newborns found that children seroconverted to either HCoV - NL63 or HCoV - 229E but not both , although both viruses are Alpha - HCoVs 70 . A later study in newborns followed from age 0 to 20 months 71 showed asymmetric interactions within Alpha - HCoVs and Beta - HCoVs : seroconversion to HCoV - NL63 was observed after HCoV - 229E but no recent HCoV - 229E seroconversions had a recent infection by HCoV - NL63 , suggesting HCoV - NL63 provides at least short - term protective immunity against HCoV - 229E . Similarly , HCoV - HKU1 seroconversion occurred prior to HCoV - OC43 but rarely after , suggesting HCoV - OC43 protected against HCoV - HKU1 . .

Individuals experiencing natural infections with HCoV - OC43 or HCoV - 229E did not have detectable antibodies in acute or convalescent samples against SARS - CoV - 1 ( to N protein 72 ; by IFA or neutralization 39 ) . Healthy individuals with antibodies to HCoV - 229E , HCoV - OC43 , and other endemic HCoVs rarely had detectable antibodies that bound SARS - CoV - 1 infected cells or SARS - CoV - 1 N protein 68 , 73 , 74 . HCoV - OC43 N and SARS - CoV - 1 N proteins have a subset of sites with shared homology , potentially explaining low - level false positive results for N - based assays 75 . Blood donors in Southern China ( n = 152 ) and Saudi Arabia ( n = 130 ) did not have detectable binding ( IFA ) or neutralizing antibodies to either MERS - CoV or SARS - CoV - 1 76 , 77 . Because children experience less severe disease during SARS - CoV - 1 infection than adults , it was hypothesized that childhood vaccination with non - CoVs provided cross - protection against SARS - CoV - 1 . However , binding and neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses induced by routine childhood vaccinations ( AMPV , BCG , DPT , HBV , HIB , JEV , MMRV [ and MV , RV ] , OPV , PI , SV , VV [ varicella vaccine ] ) did not cross - react with SARS - CoV - 1 in experimentally inoculated mice 78 . Emerging HCoVs can induce cross - reactive binding antibodies toward endemic and other emerging HCoVs SARS patients often experience a > 4 - fold rise in antibody to HCoV - 229E , HCoV - NL63 , and / or HCoV - OC43 in paired acute / convalescent samples ( n = 12 / 20 ) 39 . In one study , the number of SARS patients who experienced a > 4 - fold rise in binding antibodies was greater to HCoV - OC43 ( n = 10 / 11 ) than HCoV - 229E ( n = 5 / 11 ) 73 . Some SARS patients also showed a rise in antibodies to HCoV - 229E and HCoV - OC43 N protein 73 and HCoV - NL63 79 . Among SARS - CoV - 1 patients ( n = 28 ) , 60 % had detectable IFA titers to MERS - CoV and 25 % had anti - MERS - CoV neutralizing antibodies . A subset with available paired samples experienced seroconversion to HCoV - OC43 , but limited seroconversion to Alpha - CoVs . In the same study , animal handlers at a wildlife market in Guangzhou ( n = 94 ) with low - level prevalence of antibodies to SARS - CoV - 1 ( 13 . 8 % by IFA , 4 . 3 % by NT ) had detectable antibodies toward MERS - CoV ( 2 . 2 % by IF ) 76 . A follow - up study found that the cross - reactivity between SARS - CoV - 1 and MERS - CoV was unlikely to be due to similarity in the receptor - binding domain ( RBD ) , as monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) raised to SARS - CoV - 1 RBD did not bind MERS - CoV RBD or neutralize MERS - CoV even at high concentrations 80 . MERS - CoV may produce less cross - reactivity against SARS - CoV - 1 . A subset of slaughterhouse workers in Saudi Arabia had antibodies to MERS - CoV by IFA as well as to pandemic HCoVs , but none had reactivity to SARS - CoV - 1 spike protein . MERS - CoV patients were observed to have low - level cross - reactivity to SARS - CoV - 1 77 and in one study HCoV - HKU1 N protein 79 . Because of this cross - reactivity , researchers have developed diagnostic assays with truncated SARS - CoV - 1 S , N , and M proteins 81 – 84 .

Sera from BALB / c mice immunized with full length S protein from civet strains were ineffective against human SARS - CoV - 1 and vice versa 88 . Despite significant cross - reactions between mAbs against conformational epitopes of RBD with multiple mutational differences , single mutations were shown to disrupt neutralizability 89 . In contrast , mAbs targeting regions critical for fusion and entry on the S2 protein are immunogenic and can broadly neutralize SARS - CoV - 1 strains 59 , 90 . A recent study showed reduced binding of mAbs from SARS patients to the RBD of SARS - CoV - 2 , especially those that blocked binding to the ACE2 receptor . The only mAb potently bound to SARS - CoV - 2 RBD protein did not compete with the RBD for binding to the ACE2 receptor , suggesting it bound a different , conserved site on the protein 91 . Similar studies were conducted to study changes in MERS - CoV . Five recombinant RBD proteins were constructed with mutations detected from MERS - CoV strains isolated in humans ( 2012 - 2015 ) and camels 92 . These RBDs maintained functionality and induced potent neutralizing antibodies . When residues in their receptor binding motifs were mutated to evade neutralization , cross - reactivity persisted but binding affinity to DPP - 4 ( the main receptor for MERS - CoV ) was lost , suggesting limited antigenic escape for MERS - CoV . A study of MERS - CoV isolates with distinct amino acid differences in the S and other replication proteins found differences in replication kinetics , but it is not clear that these were attributable to differences in S 93 . Immunopathogenesis In the initial review , 38 papers were identified as related to immunopathogenesis . Of these , we found 25 sufficiently relevant to review in Table S6 , and 16 of those are detailed below and summarized in Figure 6 . Antibody - dependent enhancement ( ADE ) may be possible Multiple studies have suggested the possibility that pre - existing antibodies increase disease by facilitating viral entry into cells . This mechanism , a long hypothesized explanation for severe dengue infections , is called antibody - dependent enhancement ( ADE ) . This has also been hypothesized as relevant to coronaviruses specifically in patients who seroconverted early in SARS - CoV - 1 infection 25 , 94 , 95 . Reasons why some individuals can mount responses more quickly than others are unknown , but the correlation between greater age and early response with higher titers suggest priming effects from existing antibodies against endemic strains 95 . Authors from another study pointed toward enhancement from antibodies within the episode 17 . Nasopharyngeal viral load increased in the first week and declined thereafter but clinical worsening was seen in many of the patients at week two , with virus shedding in stool and urine observed towards the end 25 , 94 . Many manifested with new - appearing lesions as original lesions improved . The timing of the appearance of new lesions correlated with IgG seroconversion , suggesting that pathology post week one was driven by the immune response rather than by uncontrolled viral replication . .

Observation of increased risk of disease in infants with mid - levels of maternal antibody to dengue ( compared to high or low levels of maternal antibody ) is important evidence supporting the role of antibody in pathogenesis for dengue 96 . A similar mechanism has been identified for seropositive and seronegative kittens infected with feline infectious peritonitis virus , a coronavirus that causes fatal disease in cats 97 . One study characterizing endemic HCoV in infants observed the highest lower respiratory tract infection burden ( 7 . 8 % ) at 6 - 23 months of age ( 1 . 5 % at < 6 months , close to none at 2 - 5 years ) while upper respiratory tract infection burden was close to uniform 98 . The heightened disease burden after maternal immunity waning to medium levels in the lower tract , and the absence of such observation in the upper tract where antibodies do not circulate , subtly supports the possibility of ADE in HCoVs . Suggestive enhancement mechanisms from in vitro experiments Controlled in vitro experiments have explored the possible enhancing action of antibodies for HCoV infections . A series of studies by Yip et al . demonstrated that opsonization of anti - spike antibodies allowed SARS - CoV - 1 to enter non - ACE2 expressing immune cells that bear Fc - 𝛾 - RII ( CD32 ) 99 , 100 . Though replication is observed after entry , the virus does not exit nor alter the expression of proinflammatory immune mediators ( CCL2 / MCP - 1 , CCL3 / MIP - 1 𝛼 , CXCL10 / IP - 10 , TNF - 𝛼 ) and apoptosis inducing ligands ( FasL ) 101 . This contrasts with effects in nonhuman primate studies where endocytosis into macrophages stimulated inflammation , which in turn drove severe lung injuries 102 . A study by another group in human promonocyte cell line ( HL - CZ ) , which expresses both ACE2 and Fc - 𝛾 - RII , demonstrated increased infectivity and virus - induced apoptosis when anti - SARS - CoV - 1 sera from patients were added at 100 - to 2000 - fold dilutions , while at higher concentrations neutralization occurred 103 . Upon infection , TNF - 𝛼 , IL - 4 and IL - 6 expressions heightened , while IL - 3 and IL - 1 𝛽 only appeared in trace amounts . The difference could have resulted from the cell line differences or the set of mediators assessed 104 . Regarding regions of the spike protein that may induce antibodies with enhancement effects , both anti - S1a and anti - S1b mAbs showed mild to moderate effects 103 . Only one particular anti - S1b clone showed neutralization . No effect was seen for anti - N mAbs . There is limited evidence that these mechanisms are causal to inflammatory gene expression differences among patients with differing severities 105 . Direct damage caused by antibodies While the link between antibody presence and enhanced severity via infection of immune cells remains unclear , some have suspected a role for auto - reactive responses in increased severity of illness . Prolonged tissue destruction can increase presentation of host proteins to T - or B - cells and result in an adaptive response against self , i . e . epitope spreading 52 . Anti - S2 IgG antibodies targeting uninfected lung epithelial cells ( A549 ) were detected in SARS - CoV - 1 patients after twenty days post - symptom onset 106 , a reactivity not seen in serum from healthy individuals and non - SARS - CoV - 1 pneumonia patients . Complement inactivation only showed cytotoxic effect .

Presence of anti - S2 antibodies also increased the binding of immune cells ( PBMCs ) to A549 cells treated with IFN - 𝛾 , replicating the conditions under which a cytokine storm would be observed . A separate study demonstrated colocalization of anti - S2 Abs collected from serum of SARS patients ≥50 days post - fever onset with annexin A2 and immunoprecipitated annexin A2 on A549 cell surfaces . Elevated expression of annexin A2 on the surface can be stimulated by IL - 6 and IFN - 𝛾 , both cytokines induced by SARS - CoV - 1 , which in turn increases binding of anti - S2 Abs to the cell . However , its pathogenic role was not explored 107 . Alternatively , similarity between viral and host epitopes ( molecular mimicry ) can generate cross - reactive antibodies . In mice 108 and humans 109 , there is evidence of anti - N antibodies that cross react with IL - 11 , an anti - inflammatory cytokine expressed in many tissues , including lung and bone marrow . The authors suggest high anti - N antibodies induced relatively early during infection may be involved in the thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia observed early in SARS - CoV - 1 infection 108 . Population seroprevalence From the paper review , 68 papers were classified as having data on age and seroprevalence or seroincidence , of which 20 studies were confirmed on further review , and 14 had digitizable data . The age range across studies was 0 to ≥65 , while the sample size of studies ranged from 69 - 19 , 974 ( 82 - 6 , 400 for studies of endemic HCoVs ) . Table S7 and Supplementary Data File S3 contain details of the studies . Seroprevalence to endemic coronaviruses increases rapidly during childhood For endemic coronaviruses , seroprevalence rises sharply in childhood , with little to no change in seroprevalence by age among adults . While exact dynamics from 6 months to 20 years vary between studies , the general trend remains consistent . Figure 7 displays HCoV age - seroprevalence curves for the 7 papers with digitizable data on seroprevalence by age , with the panels representing the four major endemic strains 74 , 110 – 115 . Trends from papers not displayed in the figure are largely the same 68 , 70 , 116 , 117 . Two studies show a marked decline in seroprevalence with age above 40 68 , 111 . Seroincidence of endemic coronaviruses occurs in all age groups , with no clear trend Available data sets are more sparse for incidence , and the patterns are inconsistent between studies 110 , 118 – 120 . Figure 8 displays age - incidence curves for the 4 papers with digitizable data on incidence by age , with each panel representing the two strains included in these studies ( HCoV - 229E and HCoV - OC43 ) . There was an increasing trend in seroincidence with age during an outbreak for HCoV - 229E in Tecumseh , Michigan 110 , but a similar analysis of HCoV - OC43 seroincidence in the same outbreak showed no such increase 118 .

A comparison of a cohort of 21 - 40 year - olds and a cohort of ≥65 year - olds found no clear difference in incidence between the two age groups , as measured by seroconversion or PCR - confirmed , HCoV - associated respiratory illness 120 . Finally , observational studies have shown evidence of coronavirus - associated respiratory illnesses in elderly populations 121 – 123 and across all ages 124 . The force of infection of endemic coronavirus strains is high , and the age at first infection low , but variable across studies . Simple catalytic models fit to the digitized data predict median total force of infection across studies of 0 . 21 ( 95 % CI 0 . 09 , 0 . 40 ) ( see Table S8 for estimates by study ) , corresponding to an average age at first infection with any strain of 4 . 8 years ( 95 % CI 2 . 5 , 11 . 2 ) . A cohort of 25 infants followed from birth for an average of two years experienced annual strain - specific incidence rates from 0 . 12 - 0 . 70 70 , 71 . Zhou et al . ’s serosurvey measured IgG and IgM separately , and showed very different patterns with age 115 ( Figure 7 ) . While IgG seroprevalence rose to high levels by age 10 and remained high into the adult population , IgM seroprevalence declined to zero for all individuals aged 14 and older . The authors interpreted this as evidence that first infections occurred before the age of 14 for all strains . Data are incompatible with complete , lifelong homologous immunity to endemic coronaviruses The rapid rise in seroprevalence with age observed in the literature suggests a force of infection ( and thus proportion seropositive to all serotypes at older ages ) high enough to preclude significant rates of coronavirus infection among older adults if each serotype confers lifelong homologous immunity ( Figure 9 , green dotted line ) . On the other hand , short - term , complete immunity , lifelong partial immunity , and the existence of multiple genotypes within a single serotype with limited cross - immunity could explain the age - seroprevalence and age - incidence curves seen in the literature ( Figure 9 ) . Further observations from review The review gave rise to several observations that were either consistent or conflicting across papers . Studies that enrolled children less than 6 months detected loss of maternal antibodies , representing a preliminary line of defense for newborn children 70 , 71 , 74 , 117 . Most studies showed no discernible difference in age - seroprevalence trends or in overall seroprevalence by strain . Gao et al . 68 found that seroprevalence of HCoV - 229E and HCoV - HKU1 was significantly lower than seroprevalence of HCoV - OC43 and HCoV - NL63 . In addition , Chan et al . 114 found seroprevalence to HCoV - HKU1 to be low ( 21 . 6 % in 31 - 40 year olds ) in Hong Kong , and stated that this was expected from the low rates of HCoV - HKU1 among respiratory illnesses . Finally , most studies measured the presence of binding antibodies in the blood . Of the studies in Figure 7 , only Cavallaro and Monto 110 ( red ) measured seropositivity using a neutralization assay . That the seroprevalence is markedly lower in that study compared to the others could indicate lower test .

Regarding the novel coronaviruses , serosurveys of SARS - CoV - 1 confirmed that the rate of asymptomatic or subclinical infection was very low 125 . Asymptomatic and subclinical rates of MERS - CoV are generally higher , but available serosurveys lack the power to draw strong inference about age trends . A large serosurvey conducted across Saudi Arabia found that the age of seropositive individuals was significantly lower than the age of clinical cases 126 , while another conducted across multiple countries in Africa and Asia found no trend in seroprevalence with age 127 . Studies of risk factors within camel workers have either not addressed age as a risk factor 128 , 129 or not found an association 130 . Discussion Key findings We have presented a broad , comprehensive review of multiple aspects of the literature on antibody immunity to coronaviruses . We identified a number of key findings . The median time to detection was similar across different antibodies for SARS - CoV - 1 ( 12 days ; IQR 8 - 15 . 2 days ) and SARS - CoV - 2 ( 11 days ; IQR 7 . 25 - 14 days ) , but longer for MERS - CoV ( 16 days ; IQR 13 - 19 days ) . Most long - term studies found that IgG waned over time ( typically detectable up to at least a year ) while others found detectable levels of IgG three years post symptoms onset . Antibody kinetics varied across the severity gradient with longer durations of detectable antibody associated with more severe symptoms . Human challenge studies with HCoV indicate that serum and mucosal immune responses ( serum IgG , IgA , neutralizing titer , mucosal IgA ) provide possible correlates of protection from infection and disease . However , repeat human challenge experiments with single HCoV suggest individuals can be infected with the same HCoV one year after first challenge , but with possible lower severity . There is cross - reactivity within but minimal reactivity between Alpha - and Beta - CoVs . While endemic HCoVs rarely induce cross - reactive antibodies against emerging HCoVs , SARS - CoV - 1 and MERS - CoV stimulate antibodies induced by prior HCoV infections . Multiple mechanisms for immunopathology have been suggested but no strong causal evidence exists and the extent to which the presence of antibodies affects human disease severity is not known . Seroprevalence with the four major endemic HCoV strains rose rapidly during childhood and remained high in adults . The median age at first infection with any strain was 4 . 8 years ( 95 % CI 2 . 5 , 11 . 2 ) . There was no clear trend in seroincidence with age , and many studies have demonstrated incidence of coronavirus infections in elderly populations . These results suggest a measurable impact of immunity to coronaviruses on future risk , but this protection may be transient . Limitations of systematic review We have suggested a set of search terms to identify relevant work , and others may expand on this search . Due to the speed of new research being produced , we limited our systematic review . CC - BY - NC - ND 4 . 0 International license It is made available under a author / funder , who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity . is the ( which was not peer - reviewed ) The copyright holder for this preprint . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 2020 . 04 . 14 . 20065771 doi : medRxiv preprint 18 of SARS - CoV - 2 papers to before March 20 , 2020 . Further evidence on immune responses to SARS - CoV - 2 is likely contained in work that has since been published . We excluded from the review animal studies and studies of animal CoVs to remain human - focused , but this literature is likely relevant to some areas of the review . We limited the scope of the review to antibody - mediated immunity , meaning that understanding of some areas of the review may be incomplete . Finally , digitized data could be affected by publication bias or other selection bias , meaning that it might not be representative of data from all studies . The aim of the pooled analyses was to summarize the array of studies rather than formally explore hypotheses , and as a result the models used are simple . For example , in estimating force of infection from age - stratified seroprevalence data , we did not consider other features of a model such as assay sensitivity , time - and age - varying force of infections , seroreversion , and cross - reactivity between strains , that might better explain patterns seen in the data . Implications for SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic responses and future outlooks Serological assay development There is a need for development of serological assays with high sensitivity for screening and sufficient specificity to exclude individuals from unneeded interventions . Evidence from previous emerging CoVs suggests that false negativity is likely to result from waning of antibody levels . As most studies on antibody kinetics are on symptomatic patients , the kinetics in subclinical infections , a significant proportion of SARS - CoV - 2 infections 131 , remains a key gap in the literature . Indications that less severe illnesses are associated with reduced antibody responses suggests that mild cases may pose challenges to serological assays . On the other end , the proposed policy of “immunity passports” to allow individuals presumed immune to return to work once social distancing measures are relaxed requires highly specific serological tests to mitigate adverse outcomes . Evidence from past emerging HCoVs suggests low false positivity from cross - reaction with endemic HCoVs . However , antibody titers do not necessarily translate to immunity . Challenge studies indicate multiple candidates that may serve as correlates of protection including serum and mucosal measures ; however , these will need specific evaluation for SARS - CoV - 2 . The knowledge gap in correlates of protection and their durability must be filled before immunity passports are safe for general use . Therapeutics , vaccines , and ADE Pharmaceutical interventions to protect susceptible individuals or improve outcomes among sick individuals will first need to be tested in randomized trials . Vaccines with various antigens are currently under development 132 and polyclonal antibodies from SARS - CoV - 2 - recovered patients have been used in some cases for treatment 133 . Though the evidence for immunopathogenesis remains limited 134 , it will be important to design rigorous trials that can provide valid evidence of positive effect but also detect negative effects if they occur with associated adaptive stopping criteria . Such concerns might extend beyond vaccine development if negative effects are subtle and not or weakly detectable in Phase III studies . In the event of mass vaccination following .

Long - term dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 and concluding remarks Key questions for the long - term dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 include whether it is likely to be eradicated , whether widespread immunity will lead to transient decreases in incidence and how long it will take for another large outbreak to occur . Modeling studies will be crucial in answering these questions , but they will rely on an understanding of immune responses to SARS - CoV - 2 and interactions with other coronaviruses to make relevant predictions . Analysis of datasets , specifically of serosurveys , needs to account for the kinetics of waning immunity and effects of imperfect assays to draw meaningful inferences . Finally , we note that the best evidence for immune responses to SARS - CoV - 2 will come from studies of the virus itself . Such studies are being performed and reported with unprecedented speed , but in the absence of firm evidence many are turning to the existing coronaviruses as a model . To that end we have produced this review to aid researchers in understanding the scope of the evidence for immune responses to these coronaviruses .

Results for HCoV - 229E are from Kraaijeveld et al . 45 , and report the number of individuals experiencing symptoms of a given severity that had significant antibody rises post infection . Results for MERS - CoV are taken across studies in which a cutoff for the assay being used was provided , and gives the number of patients for which IgG levels were above the respective cutoffs , at different time points ( also see Figure 4 ) . For example , at week 26 , there were 12 patients with mild symptoms from studies that reported a cutoff , and 8 of those patients had IgG levels above that cutoff .

This figure shows the areas of focus of our review within our conceptualisation of the stages of exposure and infection at which we believe antibody mediated immunity may play a role in the dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 . At the individual level ( left ) , antibody response following the first infection / exposure increases and then declines ( Antibody kinetics ) . Sometime later individuals may be exposed to SARS - CoV - 2 again . They may be protected from infection by their acquired immunity ( Correlates of protection ) . Their acquired immunity may also moderate the severity of infection with some possibility that pre - existing immunity may lead to immunopathogenesis ( relevant to both first and second exposure ) . These individual - level dynamics aggregate to form the population - level seroprevalence ( right - top ) . Measures of seroprevalence may imperfectly measure past exposure to infection due to antigenic diversity of future SARS - CoV - 2 viruses and cross - reactivity of endemic human coronaviruses ( HCoVs ) with SARS - CoV - 2 . Measures of seroprevalence may also be inconsistent across times as antibodies - levels within individuals wane . .

The left panel shows data for studies reporting IgG concentration in units of optical density , while the right panel shows data for studies reporting neutralizing antibodies in units of titers . The plotting symbols indicate whether a measurement was above the cutoff for the assay being used , if reported in the study . Some studies reported titers that were lower than or greater than some threshold value ; those are here plotted at those values ( e . g . , for ≥ 320 , the value is assumed to be 320 ) . Some studies may report kinetics of different antibodies or using different assays ( and different units ) for the same patient . Note that while these are plotted on the same axes , values may not necessarily be comparable across studies within each panel , as each lab may have different assay conditions resulting in different scales .

supporting ( red ) and contradicting ( blue ) the contributions of antibodies to the pathogenesis of SARS - CoV - 1 . Anti - S1 antibodies triggered upon infection may facilitate entry into immune cells at later stages of the infection if concentration is low . Replication happens but no virus is released . Consequential induction of cytokines are inconclusive , but if they occur , they are associated with severe disease . Roles of anti - S2 and anti - N antibodies are supported by binding observations . Items shown in grey are weaker evidence given as speculations in the literature . .
