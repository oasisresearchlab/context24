Our objective was to assess whether SARS - CoV - 2 can be transmitted through fomites , using evidence from viral culture studies . Methods : We conducted searches in the WHO Covid - 19 Database , PubMed , LitCovid , medRxiv , and Google Scholar to 31 December 2021 . We included studies that investigated fomite transmission and performed viral culture to assess the cytopathic effect ( CPE ) of positive fomite samples and confirmation of SARS - CoV - 2 as the cause of the CPE . We assessed the risk of bias using a checklist modified from the QUADAS - 2 criteria . Results : We included 23 studies . The overall risk of bias was moderate . Five studies demonstrated replication - competent virus from fomite cultures and three used genome sequencing to match fomite samples with human clinical specimens . The mean Ct of samples with positive viral culture was significantly lower compared with cultured samples that returned negative results : SMD - 1 . 45 , 95 % CI - 2 . 00 to - 0 . 90 , I 2 = 0 % ; P < 0 . 00001 . The likelihood of isolating replication - competent virus was significantly greater when the Ct was < 30 : RR 3 . 10 ( 95 % CI 1 . 32 to 7 . 31 , I 2 = 71 % , P = 0 . 01 ) . Infectious specimens were mostly detected within 7 days of symptom onset . One study showed possible transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 from fomites to humans . Conclusion : The evidence from published studies suggests that replication - competent SARS - CoV - 2 is present on fomites . Replication - competent SARS - CoV - 2 is significantly more likely when the PCR Ct for clinical specimens and fomite samples is < 30 . Further studies should investigate the duration of infectiousness of SARS - CoV - 2 and the frequency of transmission from fomites . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 3 INTRODUCTION The SARS - CoV - 2 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic continues to be a major public health concern . Based on WHO statistics , there have been over 566 million confirmed cases and over six million deaths globally as of 25th July 2022 [ 1 ] . Although several vaccines have been developed and programmes have been implemented globally , mutations in the virus have resulted in the occurrence of variants that reduce vaccine effectiveness [ 2 ] . In addition , the duration of protection appears to be limited [ 3 ] and booster doses are considered necessary [ 4 ] . In addition to the use of vaccines , a better understanding of the transmission dynamics of the virus will help with developing interventions that can interrupt the chain of transmission and reduce the spread of infection . In the early stages of the pandemic , we previously found that the evidence from published studies assessing the risk of transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 via fomites was limited [ 5 ] . Furthermore , the quality of included primary studies was low to very low , probably due to limited understanding of the dynamics of SARS - CoV - 2 shedding at the onset of the pandemic , the types of studies done , the timing of collection , and sampling issues . In addition , less than a fifth of included studies at that time examined the cytopathic effect of SARS - CoV - 2 and relied on detecting RNA from SARS - CoV - 2 . Since we published our previous review , several studies examining the potential transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 via fomites have been published . Accordingly , we considered it timely to update the evidence on fomite transmission using the highest quality evidence from all the published studies to date . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 To assess the transmission potential of fomites of SARS - CoV - 2 , we aimed to address the following questions : 1 . Are fomite samples infectious ( i . e . , replication - competent virus is present on the samples ) ? 2 . If so , what proportions are infectious , and what is the duration of infectiousness ? 3 . What is the relationship between fomite presence of SARS - CoV - 2 , infectiousness , and PCR cycle threshold ( Ct ) ? 4 . Is there evidence of a chain of transmission that establishes instances of fomite transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 ? We aimed to identify , appraise , and summarise the evidence relating to the role of fomite presence of SARS - CoV - 2 , its relationship with infectiousness ( viral culture and / or serial quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( qRT - PCR ) with or without gene sequencing ) and the factors influencing transmissibility . METHODS Search Strategy We searched the WHO Covid - 19 Database , PubMed , LitCovid , medRxiv , and Google Scholar for SARS - CoV - 2 using keywords and associated synonyms ( see Appendix 1 ) . The searches were conducted up to 31st December 2021 . No language restrictions were imposed . An information specialist ( JB ) conducted the searches . For relevant papers , we undertook forward citation to identify relevant studies . The protocol is available at https : / / www . medrxiv . org / content / 10 . 1101 / 2022 . 01 . 26 . 22269917v1 . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 We included studies of any design ( and in any setting ) that investigated fomites as a potential source for transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 , defining a fomite as any inanimate object that , when contaminated with or exposed to an infectious agent , can transfer the infectious agent to a new host and be capable of inducing disease in the new host [ 6 ] . We included studies that performed viral culture from fomite samples to assess the cytopathic effect ( CPE ) with verification techniques to ensure the cultured virus was SARS - CoV - 2 . We have previously defined viral culture as encompassing several methods that can uniquely identify the replicating agent as SARS - CoV - 2 [ 7 ] . Most commonly , this would be a plaque assay combined with a specific PCR confirmation , or immunological staining or gene sequencing of viral RNA . Viral genome sequencing is a process that helps to determine the order , or sequence , of the nucleotides in each of the genes present in a virus’s genome [ see https : / / www . cdc . gov / flu / about / professionals / genetic - characterization . htm ] . Therefore , we included studies that performed serial RT - PCR ( with or without genomic sequencing ) in addition to viral culture . We excluded predictive or modeling studies . We also excluded laboratory studies that solely aimed to investigate viral stability and / or infectiousness through inoculation of fomites with already isolated SARS - CoV - 2 virus . Two reviewers ( IJO , EAS ) independently screened study abstracts to determine eligibility . Any disagreements were resolved through discussion and consensus decisions . Quality assessment We assessed the risk of bias in included studies using modified quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies - 2 ( QUADAS - 2 ) criteria [ 8 ] . Using the patient selection , index test and flow and timing domains , we formulated the following questions to assess the risk of bias : J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 ( i ) Was the source population clearly described ? ( ii ) Were the study methods detailed enough to allow for replication of the study ? ( iii ) Were sample sources clearly described ? ( iv ) Were the analysis and reporting appropriate ? ( v ) Was the pattern and number of fomites samples sufficient to demonstrate fomite transmission ? Each domain was rated as low , unclear , or high risk of bias . One reviewer ( IJO ) assessed the risk of bias , while a second reviewer ( EAS ) independently cross - checked the ratings . Disagreements were resolved via consensus . For studies that reported positive viral cultures , we assessed the level of reporting of the methods used to obtain replicable and appropriate viral culture results using the following four items : 1 ) adequate description of specimen sampling and management ; 2 ) adequate exclusion of contamination or co - infection ( use of good controls and appropriate antibacterials and antimycotics ; 3 ) adequate reporting of results of inspection / culture ; and 4 ) definition of CPE and identification of the agent causing the CPE was verified to be SARS - CoV - 2 . We also used adapted SARS - CoV - 2 case causality criteria to assess transmission [ 7 ] . The causality categories include certain , probable / likely , possible , unlikely , or unclear ( see Appendix 2 ) . Data Extraction For each included study , we extracted the following data onto customised Excel spreadsheets : study ID , setting , types of participants , sources of fomites , methods used to detect SARS - CoV - 2 , timing of sample collection and number of samples , PCR Cts , internal controls for Cts , hygiene procedures , methods and thresholds for viral culture , methods for genomic sequencing , and study results . One reviewer ( IJO ) extracted the data , and these data were independently verified by a second reviewer ( CJH ) . Disagreements were resolved through discussion . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 Data Analysis We used summary tables to present the frequency of SARS - CoV - 2 positive tests from fomites , Cts , CPE results , information on viral cultures , timing of collection from patients with respect to symptom onset , including the methods ( timing , media ) , and verification techniques [ 7 ] . For studies attempting viral cultures , we used mean and standard deviation ( SD ) and median with interquartile range ( IQR ) as measures of central dispersion . We used mean differences ( MD ) with SD to compute effect estimates for individual studies . For two studies that did not provide suitable data to compute SD , we used the average measure of SD for positive samples across the other studies to compute their SD [ 9 ] . Using the random - effects model of the standard meta - analysis software ( RevMan 5 . 4 ) [ 10 ] we compared the Ct values for positive versus negative viral cultures . Because of lack of standardisation in Ct values across studies , standardised mean differences ( SMD ) with 95 % confidence intervals ( CI ) were used to compute overall effect estimates . Post hoc , we calculated the pooled relative effect of a binary cycle threshold cut - off of < 30 . We used I - square ( I 2 ) statistics to assess heterogeneity ; values of 25 % , 50 % , and 75 % represented mild , moderate , and substantial heterogeneity , respectively . We performed sensitivity analyses by excluding two studies for which SDs were imputed , and through exclusion of one study in which fomite samples were not collected serially . One reviewer ( IJO ) conducted the meta - analyses ; these were independently cross - checked by a second reviewer ( CJH ) . Role of the funding source The funders had no role in study design ; in the collection , analysis , and interpretation of data ; in the writing of the report ; and in the decision to submit the paper for publication . RESULTS J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 8 We identified 62 citations ( see Figure 1 ) , and a further five through bibliography searches resulting in a total number of 67 eligible studies . We excluded 22 studies that did not perform viral cultures , 10 that were laboratory - based , six systematic reviews , and four because they were narrative reviews . We excluded one study because it was an opinion piece and another study which was correspondence . [ See Appendix 3 for reference list of excluded studies ] . Finally , 23 studies 11 - 33 ] were included in the review . The main characteristics of included studies are detailed in Tables 1 - 3 . Seven studies were conducted in the USA , 3 in Canada , 2 each in Brazil , China and the United Kingdom , and 1 each in Finland , Israel , Italy , Malaysia , Peru , Singapore , and South Korea ( Table 1 ) . Eleven studies were conducted exclusively in hospitals [ 12 , 14 , 15 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 22 , 23 , 31 - 33 ] , one of which was exclusively in an ICU [ 22 ] . Three studies were conducted in both hospital and quarantine or home / community settings [ 16 , 24 , 30 ] . One study was performed in a university setting ( college campus and community ) [ 11 ] , two in public and / or open spaces [ 13 , 20 ] , four were exclusively in residential settings [ 21 , 27 - 29 ] and two at dockyards [ 25 , 26 ] . Sixteen studies collected fomite samples from the environment of patients with confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( see Table 1 ) . In two studies [ 12 , 32 ] all patients required high flow oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation . Two studies [ 25 , 26 ] involved workers at dockyards , and three [ 13 , 20 , 29 ] did not involve any human subjects . The fomites sources included objects / areas within patients’ rooms / wards , objects / areas outside patients’ rooms , and objects / areas in the community which were classified as high and low touch ( see Box 1 and Table 1 ) . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 Box 1 The sources of fomites in included studies High - frequency Touch Surfaces Low - frequency Touch Surfaces Patients’ rooms / wards Call bells , bedside tables , medical equipment , cell phones , bed rails , tissues , washcloths Healthcare workers ( HCWs ) stations Hospital equipment - ventilator , endotracheal tube straps , floor , IV pump , arterial line plunger , X - ray machine , medication cart , etc . ) , Outside patients’ rooms / wards Ward telephones , computer keyboards , clinical equipment ( syringe pumps , urinary catheters ) , hand - cleaning facilities ( hand washing basins , alcohol gel dispensers ) Air vent , floors , tables In the community Cold - chain containers at dockyards , and food surfaces ( bulk rice , chicken , cheese , fruits ) Quality assessment The reporting quality of included studies is shown in Figure 2 ( see also Appendix Table 1 ) . Eighteen studies ( 78 % ) adequately described the study population , and 21 ( 91 % ) described their study methods in sufficient detail . Twenty studies ( 87 % ) clearly specified the fomite sources , and 20 ( 87 % ) sufficiently reported the analysis of their results . Seven studies ( 30 % ) sufficiently investigated fomite transmission . None of the included studies published a protocol . The overall reporting quality was rated as moderate . Methods used to detect SARS - CoV - 2 in fomites Twenty - one studies ( 91 % ) used RT - PCR to detect the presence of SARS - CoV - 2 RNA in fomites ( Table 1 ) ; the methods generally involved targeting the nucleocapsid ( N ) and / or envelope ( E ) genes of SARS - CoV - 2 . One study [ 24 ] used immunostaining and another [ 26 ] used nucleic J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 acid , in addition to RT - PCR to confirm that the cultured virus was SARS - CoV - 2 . The remaining two studies used a nucleic acid detection kit [ 13 ] and LAMP assays [ 29 ] . SARS - CoV - 2 PCR Cycle threshold values for positive tests from fomite samples A total of 11 studies ( 48 % ) pre - specified the Ct for positive tests ( Table 1 ) ; studies using commercially available RT - PCR assays used the manufacturer specified Ct threshold as indicated in the product insert for the assay . Four studies [ 20 , 21 , 23 , 25 ] used a cut - off of < 40 , and two studies [ 12 , 24 ] used < 35 . Four studies used the following cut - offs : < 45 [ 32 ] , < 40·4 [ 33 ] , < 39 [ 13 ] , and < 38 [ 30 ] . One study [ 14 ] used two Ct range values ( 30·0 - 30·8 and 33·8 – 35·1 ) as positive controls depending on the concentration of plaque - forming units ( PFU ) ( 1 PFU and 0·1 PFU , respectively ) ; negative controls were reagent blanks without any sample . Another study [ 11 ] used the limit of detection ( LOD ) of 75 SARS - CoV - 2 RNA copies / sample as cut - off point for positivity , and a third used LOD of 3·9 copies / reaction . Twelve studies ( 52 % ) did not report pre - specified Ct values for positivity . SARS - CoV - 2 PCR results in fomite samples The number of swab samples across the studies ranged from 7 to 4370 . All 23 studies reported positive SARS - CoV - 2 PCR tests from the samples taken , ranging from 0 . 1 % to 52 . 5 % of the samples obtained across all the studies ( Table 2 ) . The Ct values were lowest in fomite samples from two studies [ 12 , 19 ] that included participants receiving either high - flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation : 22 . 3 to 29 . 7 , and 23 to 26 , respectively . A third study [ 32 ] , including participants on oxygen , reported higher Ct values ( 35 - 40 ) ; however , the investigators noted that participants in the high - flow nasal oxygen ( HFNO ) group were sampled significantly later in their illness compared to those receiving only supplemental oxygen : mean 16 - days vs mean 9 days , J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 11 from symptom onset , respectively . The authors of one study of SARS - CoV - 2 patients in acute care [ 23 ] reported that hypoxia on admission ( P = 0 . 003 ) , Ct ≤30 on or after the sampling date ( P = 0 . 006 ) , higher Charlson comorbidity index score ( P = 0 . 002 ) , and shorter time from illness onset ( < 7 days ) to sampling date ( P = 0 . 02 ) were significantly associated independent risk factors for positive SARS - CoV - 2 PCR tests from fomite samples . In one study that included 31 SARS - CoV - 2 infected participants [ 30 ] , the frequency of positive tests on fomite samples was significantly higher when multiple patients were in the same ward or home . Findings from one study [ 13 ] reported that SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was not detected on food surfaces . One study [ 29 ] showed that SARS - CoV - 2 RNA is more likely to be detected on bank cards and ID cards compared to bank notes and coins . SARS - CoV - 2 viral culture methods in fomite samples A summary of the key details for viral culture is shown in Table 3 . All the studies described the methods used to isolate SARS - CoV - 2 except one [ 25 ] ; in another study [ 26 ] , the methods used to culture virus from fomite surfaces were not sufficiently described . All the studies that described their methods used VERO cells for testing viral growth . In three studies [ 11 , 24 , 32 ] , culture media was supplemented with recombinant VERO cells expressing transmembrane serine protease 2 ( TMPRSS2 ) . In 12 studies ( 52 . 2 % ) , the VERO cells were cultured in Dulbecco ' s Modified Eagle’s Medium ( DMEM ) , and one study [ 31 ] used Hanks’ minimum essential medium ( HMEM ) . The criteria used for including fomite samples for viral culture varied across the studies ( see Table 3 ) . In 15 studies ( 65 . 2 % ) , all positive SARS - CoV - 2 samples were included for viral culture ( Table 3 ) . In another three studies ( 13 % ) [ 16 , 19 , 24 ] , all surface J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 12 samples were included for viral culture . The duration of incubation ranged from 3 - 14 days across 19 studies ( see Table 3 ) . In four studies ( 17 . 4 % ) [ 11 , 25 , 26 , 31 ] , the duration of incubation was not specified . SARS - CoV - 2 viral culture results in fomite samples Five studies ( 22 % ) [ 12 , 23 - 25 , 27 ] reported recoverable infectious virus from culture ( Table 3 ) . Four of these five studies [ 12 , 23 , 24 , 27 ] adequately reported the methods used to isolate infectious virus , while the reporting was unclear in one study ( appendix Table 2 ) . The highest Ct value across these studies was from which culturable SARS - CoV - 2 was detected was 31 . 78 . A sixth study [ 22 ] that reported a positive viral culture in one sample had a Ct value of 34 ; however , the sample tested negative for SARS - CoV - 2 on RT - PCR on the third day . The highest proportion of positive cultures ( 10 / 21 , 48 % ) involved adult patients with SARS - CoV - 2 both in hospital and in the community [ 24 ] . The authors reported the likelihood of infectious SARS - CoV - 2 was significantly higher with lower Ct values ( mean Ct 19 . 6±5 . 1 vs . 29 . 2±4 . 2 , P < 0 . 0001 ) . With the exception of patients with immunodeficiency or critically ill patients , all the infectious specimens were detected within 7 days after symptom onset . In Ahn 2000 [ 12 ] , of three patients ( all critically ill and / or cancer patients ) with SARS - CoV - 2 and on oxygen supplementation , nearly half ( 47 % ) of the 15 positive SARS - CoV - 2 fomite samples were positive on viral culture . In Kowta 2021 [ 23 ] , the likelihood of positive viral culture was significantly more likely if the fomite sample was collected within 7 days of symptom onset ( P = 0 . 02 ) ; this likelihood was an independent risk factor on logistic regression . In Lin et al [ 24 ] environmental samples were assessed by time post symptom onset and the actual quantity of virus was determined by quantitative culture . They found the ability to detect culturable virus J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 13 occurred most readily within the first 7 days after symptom onset and then declined dramatically with the exception of immunocompromised patients who had positive cultures in both clinical and fomite samples for prolonged periods . Facial tissues ( 80 % of all samples , 4 . 0 x 10 1 to 2 . 0 x 10 3 PFU / mL ) , nasal prongs ( 75 % of all samples , 5 x 10 0 to 1 . 1 x 10 2 PFU / mL ) , and dentures found lying on the bedside table for at least 4 hours , ( 4 . 5 x 10 1 PFU / mL ) were some of the types of fomites found to be positive and had very large burdens of SARS - CoV - 2 . Some phone and call bell samples were also found to contain infectious virus ranging from 2 . 0 x 10 2 to 1 . 9 x 10 3 PFU / mL . The positive culture from a nightstand swab in the only other study providing symptom onset and / or test date positivity was at 2 days and from a household case in a healthy person [ 27 ] . The median Ct for positive samples was lower compared with negative samples : 26 . 1 ( IQR 6 . 2 ) vs 31 . 6 ( IQR 4 . 2 ) ( see appendix Figure 1 ) . A meta - analysis of five studies after imputing SDs for the two studies with only one positive culture [ 12 , 23 - 25 , 27 ] showed that a lower Ct was significantly associated with positive viral cultures : SMD - 1 . 45 , 95 % CI - 2 . 00 to - 0 . 90 , I 2 = 0 % ; P < 0 . 00001 ( n = 102 ) ( Figure 3a ) . A meta - analysis of only three studies without imputation of SDs [ 12 , 23 , 24 ] showed similar results : SMD - 1 . 34 , 95 % CI - 1 . 91 to - 0 . 76 , I 2 = 0 % ; P < 0 . 00001 ( n = 73 ) ( Figure 3b ) . A post - hoc analysis showed that the relative risk of a positive viral culture result was three times more likely if the Ct was less than 30 : RR 3 . 10 ( 95 % CI 1 . 32 to 7 . 31 , I 2 = 71 % ; P = 0 . 01 , n = 102 samples , Figure 4 ) . Sensitivity analyses after removing one study that did not collect fomite samples serially [ 24 ] showed similar results , but with significant reduction in heterogeneity : RR 4 . 55 ( 95 % CI 2 . 55 to 8 . 14 , I 2 = 0 % , P < 0 . 00001 , n = 81 samples ) . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 14 One of the included studies [ 24 ] that reported positive viral cultures from fomites assessed the duration of infectiousness by demonstrating a clinical sample with infectious virus retained its infectiousness on fomites such as a call bell , computer keyboard , stethoscope diaphragm and a N95 respirator for up to 4 hours with minimal reduction in quantitative burden and in dried saliva for 2 hours with no reduction . One study [ 25 ] demonstrated evidence of possible SARS - CoV - 2 transmission from fomites ( infected cold - chain containers ) to humans ( dockworkers ) ; however , the study authors did not describe the methods used for viral culture . SARS - CoV - 2 Gene sequencing Five studies [ 18 , 23 , 24 - 26 ] performed gene sequencing ( appendix Table 3 ) ; however , only three of these [ 23 - 25 ] reported positive viral cultures ( see Table 3 ) . All three studies with positive viral cultures from fomite samples that used gene sequencing showed associations with each other and / or with genetic material from human respiratory samples . In Kowta 2021 [ 23 ] , 23 / 152 samples passed quality control and were submitted to Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data ( GISAID ) ( https : / / www . gisaid . org / ) . All 23 samples clustered with the nasopharyngeal swab from SARS - CoV - 2 patients that were admitted to the same room ( Appendix Table 3 ) . The Lin et al study [ 24 ] used a SARS - CoV - 2 strain from GISAID as positive control and plaque reference . Genomic sequences were submitted to the Pangolin lineage assigner ( https : / / pangolin . cog - uk . io / ) . Subsets of virus isolates were also confirmed through de - staining and immunostaining . In the plaque assays , characteristic halos were observed in samples from facial tissues ( with one sampled about 9 hours after use ) , a facecloth lying on a patient’s bed , a patient gown , a bedrail , dentures , nasal prongs , a cell phone , and a call bell used by patients infected with SARS - CoV - 2 . In the Ma 2021 study of samples from dockyards [ 25 ] , two case ( dockworkers ) samples and 11 frozen cod samples with positive nucleic acid results shared 12 nucleotide mutation sites with the Wuhan reference strain . Five outer J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 15 packaging - related strains shared one unique nucleotide mutation with the strain from one of the case samples demonstrating the strains were identical . The sequences for the 11 samples were also deposited on the GISAID database . DISCUSSION Summary of main findings Our results show that infectious SARS - CoV - 2 can be readily detected on fomites in specific settings . Genome sequencing following positive culture results in three studies also provided supportive evidence for the SARS - CoV - 2 strains being identical on these fomites . The likelihood of positive SARS - CoV - 2 PCR tests on fomites is significantly greater if the Ct from nasopharyngeal swabs in SARS - CoV - 2 - infected individuals is < 30 , and if multiple SARS - CoV - 2 - infected patients share the same space . The number of samples with positive PCR test results were extensive ( see Table 2 ) , and Ct values were lowest in fomite samples from participants receiving either high - flow oxygen or mechanical ventilation based on the studies analyzed . The evidence from the included studies suggests that positive SARS - CoV - 2 culture is at least three times more likely when the positive RT - PCR Ct value is below 30 . The significant heterogeneity observed in the overall results is largely due to one study [ 24 ] that used different methods ( and varied intervals ) to collect the fomite samples ; the removal of this study resulted in homogeneity in the results . Four of the infectious viral culture samples were in a hospital J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 16 setting with virus samples found on various high touch surfaces and one was in a fish cluster pallet at the port dock ( see Box 2 ) . Box 2 . Sites of replication - competent samples Ahn 2020 : Nasal prong , bedside table , floor near the patient , remote control , bed rails , bedsheets , and NIV mask . Kowta 2021 : Bathroom door , bed and switch , phone , table and chair , toilet and sink ( 1 / 4 ) . Lin 2021 : Used tissues , facecloth , gown deposit , nasal prongs , dentures , phone / call bells , bed rail , dentures on bedside tables . Ma 2021 : Fish cluster pallet . Marcenac 2021 : Nightstand swab . The findings in the four studies providing data on timing of collection and symptom onset [ 12 , 23 , 24 , 27 ] demonstrate collection of fomite specimens in the environment of infected persons within the first few days post symptom onset in normal hosts is most likely and is not only biologically probable but also very consistent with the recent human challenge experiments with SARS - CoV - 2 which demonstrates the kinetics of viral culturablity by time post symptom onset [ 34 ] . That higher Charlson index morbidity scores were independently associated with increased risk of transmission in one study [ 23 ] may be related to more severely ill persons having higher levels of infectious virus due to their underlying illness which then more readily transmits into the environment . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 17 Evidence for a chain of transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 from fomites to humans was not reported in the studies reviewed . Nonetheless , a chain of transmission was demonstrated by SARS - CoV - 2 from respiratory tract specimens which can deposit on “fomites” that can survive for many hours and can readily cause invasive infection in the Syrian hamster model l [ 24 ] at very low infecting doses [ 37 ] , fulfilling both the Gwaltney - Hendley postulates of viral causation and Koch’s postulates [ 38 ] . These very low infectious doses are consistent with the recently published human challenge experiments demonstrating infection in 53 % using an inoculum of only 10 TCID50 ( ~ 7PFU ) in 0·1 mL of a wild - type virus ( SARS - CoV - 2 / human / GBR / 484861 / 2020 ) [ 39 ] . The overall quality of the evidence was moderate , but the results are strengthened by study replication , the homogeneity of the pooled results and the genomic sequencing demonstrating identical strains on the fomite and from the infected source person . Although three studies [ 23 - 25 ] showed evidence of transmission using genome sequencing , the results should be interpreted with caution because the default settings of the databases currently used for phylogenetic analysis are not robust enough to conclusively demonstrate transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 [ 35 , 36 ] . Comparison with existing reviews We have identified several reviews in the published literature that investigate the role of fomite transmission in SARS - CoV - 2 . In our previous review on fomite transmission [ 5 ] , we found 11 studies that attempted culture , but none was able to demonstrate replication - competent virus . Similar results were found in another systematic review that investigated fomite transmission [ 40 ] - no virus was isolated after culture of 242 fomite samples across six included studies . The J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 18 findings from the present review differ because we identified 23 studies and included five studies that demonstrated replication - competence on culture and looked at more appropriate timing of collection . Another review of 39 studies [ 41 ] concluded that the duration of exposure of fomites to infected patients was largely responsible for the variation in the prevalence of fomites contamination . However , our results indicate that inconsistency in Ct cut - offs and timing of sample collection from symptom onset also markedly influence the probability of obtaining positive test results . A fourth systematic review of 51 cross - sectional studies examining fomites transmission in hospitals [ 42 ] showed that culturable SARS - CoV - 2 was demonstrated in two studies . Our review includes three additional studies that were not available in that review , and pooled results along with reporting the results of genome sequencing . The latter finding is important as it demonstrates the identical strain found on the fomite and the infected source person . Replication - competent virus was recovered from several pieces of commonly used medical equipment and had little loss of infectiousness after 4 hours on several items in one study [ 24 ] . Several laboratory studies have demonstrated survival of SARS - CoV - 2 on multiple commonly encountered fomites for several hours [ 43 , 44 ] , strengthening the plausibility of a chain of transmission from fomites . Strengths and limitations To our knowledge , this is the most comprehensive review to date that investigates the potential for fomite transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 . We conducted extensive literature searches to identify J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 19 relevant studies ( including those awaiting peer review ) and we accounted for the reporting quality of included studies . Our review is the first that meta - analyses the Ct results of viral culture studies on fomites . All our results ( except for one ) showed no heterogeneity , suggesting the direction of effects are likely to be the same irrespective of the methods used for viral culture . In addition , we investigated whether the results of genome sequencing were consistent with viral culture results . However , we recognize some limitations . We may not have identified all available studies investigating viral culture in fomites . In addition , the failure in many studies to sufficiently demonstrate replication - competent SARS - CoV - 2 , coupled with variation in Ct cut - off values and differences in sampling methods , limits the robustness of our conclusions . However , studies that have patients with high Cts that lack infectiousness or sample late in the stage infection will not detect replication - competent virus in environmental samples which is a major shortcoming in many studies and represents a methodologic flaw that would underestimate the true nature of positive fomite samples , leading to erroneous conclusions . Furthermore , the small number of studies included in our meta - analyses limits the applicability of the study findings . Implications for research and policy Our findings suggest that SARS - CoV - 2 transmission through fomites exists and may have been under - appreciated due to methodologic shortcomings in many early studies during the pandemic . Indeed , results of laboratory studies have demonstrated the infectivity of SARS - CoV - 2 on fomites and especially with the omicron variant [ 45 , 46 ] . However , there is still a paucity in the number of well conducted studies demonstrating SARS - CoV - 2 transmission through fomites . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 20 One study [ 24 ] found replication - competent virus on patients’ hands , a kiss sample , and dried saliva ( see Table 3 ) . These samples were not included in our review because it is unclear whether they could be defined as fomites . Some authors have suggested that all surfaces and objects should be considered as fomites [ 6 ] . The definitions of what might be considered a fomite requires further clarification . Our findings support that hand hygiene and surface decontamination procedures should be encouraged to limit the risk of fomite transmission and should remain a cornerstone of Public Health prevention policies . Although some authors suggested that fomite transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 is exaggerated , and surface decontamination represents excesses that are counterproductive [ 47 , 48 ] , the relevance of hand hygiene and surface decontamination procedures should not be underestimated . The likelihood of detecting replication - competent SARS - CoV - 2 on fomites samples is greater in high - risk patient settings . Consistent with our review findings , Liu and colleagues [ 49 ] have shown that fomite contamination of surfaces is significantly associated with Ct values and the interval to collection of samples . Future studies should consider using lower Ct values as cut - off to detect replication - competent SARS - CoV - 2 . In addition , investigators in future studies should ensure that fomites samples are collected within the first few days of symptom onset in patients to maximise yield . We have recently suggested a framework for studies investigating the transmission of viral respiratory pathogens [ 50 ] . Although one study [ 25 ] provided evidence of transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 from cold - chain containers to humans , the methodology used for viral isolation and cross - identification was unclear . While some groups of authors have suggested that SARS - CoV - 2 can be transmitted J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 21 through fomites in relation to cold - chain food products [ 51 - 53 ] , others have argued that the risk of transmission through this source is low [ 54 , 55 ] . Further well - designed studies are required to improve our understanding in this area . CONCLUSIONS The evidence from published studies suggests that replication - competent SARS - CoV - 2 can be found in fomites and factors of major importance including the timing of sampling from symptom onset , severity of the patients’ illness and the Ct below 30 ( high viral titre ) are associated with replication - competent virus in fomite samples . Replication - competent SARS - CoV - 2 can be readily detected on fomites in specific settings . The results suggest a plausible chain of transmission that is strengthened by study replication , the homogeneity of the pooled results and genomic sequencing demonstrating identical strain on the fomite and the source person . However , more rigorous studies are required to demonstrate the extent and settings in which fomites are responsible for transmission with subsequent invasive infection from SARS - CoV - 2 . Future studies should also investigate how long replication - competent virus remains infectious on various fomites in real - world scenarios and obtain specimens which are appropriately timed to avoid critical sampling bias .
