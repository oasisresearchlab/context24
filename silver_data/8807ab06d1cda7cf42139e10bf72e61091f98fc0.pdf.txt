We therefore developed a com - bined labeling protocol based on this design ( Online Methods ) . Wild - type ( OreR ) embryos at nuclear cleavage cycles 11 – 14 were collected , labeled and imaged using laser scanning confocal micro - scopy ( Fig . 1a and Online Methods ) . The images were analyzed as described below ( Supplementary Note ) . In the hb mRNA channel , we observed two distinct groups of foci ( spots ) , distinguishable by their intensity and size ( Fig . 1b ) . We identified the smaller , weaker spots as individual mature hb mRNAs , whereas the larger , brighter ones were mapped to the accumulation of multiple nascent mRNAs at the sites of active hb transcription 6 . The measured lifetime of both species following inhibition of transcription initiation supported this interpretation ( Supplementary Fig . 1 and Online Methods ) , and the measured numbers of active hb sites were consistent with previous reports 7 – 9 ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . We performed automated recognition of the individual fluorescent foci and extracted the intensity value corresponding to a single hb mRNA ( Supplementary Fig . 3 and Supplementary Note ) . We then used this value to convert the intensity of the smFISH signal at each transcription site to the total amount of hb mRNA ( in units of mRNA molecules ) at that gene locus 4 . The maximal measured level of hb transcription was in excel - lent agreement with a previous report 6 ( Supplementary Fig . 3 ) . Using a number of methods , we estimated our mRNA detection efficiency to be > 80 % and the resulting error in measuring nascent mRNA to be < 10 % ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . In the Bcd protein channel , we verified that the antibody signal was proportional to Bcd concentration by measuring both the autofluo - rescence and immunofluorescence signal in a transgenic fly strain in which Bcd is fused to EGFP 10 ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . To convert the immunofluorescence signal to absolute Bcd concentration , we used two methods ( Supplementary Note ) . In the first method , we automatically detected individual , diffraction - limited immunofluo - rescent spots in the cytoplasmic regions of the embryo ( Fig . 1c ) . After discarding false positive spots ( likely the result of nonspecific labeling by primary antibodies ) , we used the extracted single - protein intensity to convert nuclear fluorescence to Bcd concentration in each nucleus of a given embryo . In the second method , we made use of the spatial fluctuations of the fluorescence signal inside each nucleus ( Fig . 1c ) . We used the slope of the variance - versus - mean curve in each embryo to obtain the single - Bcd fluorescence value and convert nuclear fluorescence to Bcd concentration . The two methods showed good agreement in estimating the maximal Bcd concentration in a given embryo ( ratio of 1 . 01 with an s . d . of ~ 10 % , 31 embryos ; Fig . 1d ) . Measuring the maximal concentration of EGFP - Bcd in a transgenic fly strain yielded values that lie between the estimates of two previous studies 3 , 11 ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . combining protein and mrna quantification to decipher transcriptional regulation Heng Xu 1 – 3 , Leonardo A Sepúlveda 1 , 3 , Lauren Figard 4 , Anna Marie Sokac 1 & Ido Golding 1 – 3 We combine immunofluorescence and single - molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization ( smfish ) , followed by automated image analysis , to quantify the concentration of nuclear transcription factors , number of transcription factors bound , and number of nascent mrnas synthesized at individual gene loci . a theoretical model is used to decipher how transcription factor binding modulates the stochastic kinetics of mrna production . We demonstrate this approach by examining the regulation of hunchback in the early Drosophila embryo . Sequence - specific transcription factors bind to regulatory DNA elements and interact with the cell’s transcriptional machinery to regulate mRNA production . Despite the central role of this process in cellular function , a quantitative mapping between transcription factor binding and the activity of the regulated gene is still lacking 1 . For this mapping to be obtained , transcriptional regulation needs to be characterized at the level of the individual gene copy , simultaneously capturing the stochastic events of transcription factor binding and mRNA production 2 . Here we present an approach to pursue this goal . To demonstrate our method , we examined the regulation of the zygotic gene hunchback ( hb ) by the maternal transcription factor Bicoid ( Bcd ) in the early embryo of Drosophila melanogaster . As a morphogen , nuclear Bcd concentration naturally varies by > 50 - fold within a single embryo 3 ; we could therefore examine its concentration - dependent activity without needing to externally perturb the system . To simultaneously quantify hb mRNA production and Bcd protein concentration , we combined smFISH 4 , 5 with antibody staining ( immunofluorescence ) . Combining smFISH and immuno - fluorescence is challenging , as reaction conditions for the two procedures conflict in multiple ways ( Online Methods ) . We tested different protocol designs and found that smFISH labeling followed by immunofluorescence can preserve both the smFISH 1 Verna & Marrs McLean Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology , Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , Texas , USA . 2 Center for the Physics of Living Cells , University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign , Urbana , Illinois , USA . 3 Center for Theoretical Biological Physics , Rice University , Houston , Texas , USA . 4 Integrative Molecular and Biomedical Sciences Graduate Program , Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , Texas , USA .

A ll r i gh t s r ese r ve d . 740 | VOL . 12 NO . 8 | AUGUST 2015 | nature methods brief communications To analyze hb regulation , we first plotted the number of nascent hb mRNAs versus nuclear Bcd concentration for all hb loci ( within the range 0 . 25 – 0 . 7 embryo length ( EL ) ) in each embryo ( Fig . 2a ) . Binning the data along the Bcd axis yielded the gene regulation function 12 ( Fig . 2a , Supplementary Fig . 6 and Supplementary Note ) . We fitted the gene regulation function of each embryo to a Hill function 3 ( Fig . 2a and Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . The Hill coeffi - cient h was approximately constant during cycles 11 – 13 , h = 6 . 6 ± 0 . 4 ( designates mean ± s . e . m . throughout ) ( Fig . 2b ) . A possible interpretation is that hb transcription is activated through the cooperative binding of six or seven Bcd proteins at the hb regula - tory region 3 , 13 . To test this idea , we performed the same analysis for a fly strain in which a lacZ reporter gene is driven by three high - affinity Bcd binding sites fused to a minimal promoter ( bcd3 - lacZ ) 14 ( Online Methods ) . The analysis yielded h = 3 . 1 ± 0 . 2 ( Fig . 2b and Supplementary Fig . 7 ) , i . e . , a Hill coefficient approxi - mately equal to the known number of Bcd binding sites in this construct . These results suggest that the measured Hill coefficient in wild - type embryos estimates the number of Bcd proteins that bind cooperatively to regulate hb expression . Our next goal was to use the measured variability in number of nascent hb mRNAs ( Supplementary Fig . 8 and Supplementary Note ) to extract information about the way Bcd modulates the stochastic kinetics of promoter activity . This was done by compar - ing the observed mRNA copy - number statistics to the prediction of a theoretical model describing hb kinetics . In the model , the gene stochastically switches between an inactive ( OFF ) and an active ( ON ) state , and transcription initiation is possible only in the active state . ON and OFF switching and transcription initiation are characterized by Poissonian rates k ON , k OFF and k INI , respectively 2 . Transcription initiation is followed by mRNA elongation ( with speed V EL ) and release , both modeled as deterministic processes ( Fig . 2c ) . We solved the model to obtain the steady - state distri - bution of nascent hb mRNAs per gene locus as a function of the kinetic parameters ( Supplementary Note ) . To compare model predictions with the observed hb statistics , we binned the entire single - locus data set from each embryo into multiple Bcd - concentration windows ( Fig . 2c ) . We then applied maximum - likelihood parameter estimation to fit the experimen - tal nascent mRNA distribution in each window ( Supplementary Fig . 9 and Supplementary Note ) . We found that good agreement between theory and experiment was achieved by assuming that only k ON is affected by Bcd concentration , whereas k OFF and k INI remain constant ( Fig . 2d and Supplementary Figs . 9 and 10 ) . In support of the fitting procedure , the extracted value for the maximal transcription rate , k TX = k INI k ONmax / ( k ONmax + k OFF ) = 18 . 9 ± 0 . 4 min −1 , was consistent with previous estimates 9 , 15 . As another test , we used our calculated parameters to simulate nascent mRNA accumulation at a single hb locus and found good agreement with the results of a recent live - embryo study 7 ( Supplementary Fig . 11 and Supplementary Note ) . Our analysis indicated that the dependence of k ON on Bcd con - centration during cycles 11 – 13 can be approximated by a Hill func - tion ( Fig . 2d and Supplementary Fig . 12 ) , with a Hill coefficient h = 6 . 5 ± 0 . 3 ( Fig . 2e ) , very close to what we found for the gene regulation function above ( Fig . 2b ) . This observation suggests a direct relation between cooperative Bcd binding and the switching of hb to an active transcriptional state ( Supplementary Fig . 13 ) .

We note that even at the highest Bcd concentration , the hb gene is active only k ON / ( k ON + k OFF ) = 53 % ± 1 % of the time , which is consistent with the higher - than - Poisson noise measured at the anterior part of the embryo ( Supplementary Fig . 8 and ref . 6 ) . We next set out to directly measure Bcd binding at the hb gene locus . We used the presence of nascent mRNA ( smFISH signal ) to identify the spatial positions of hb gene copies in the nucleus ( Fig . 3a ) . We then defined Bcd enrichment at the hb locus as the difference between the Bcd immunofluorescence signal in the vicinity of the nascent transcripts and the signal elsewhere in the nucleus 16 . In a single nucleus , the measured enrichment is predicted to have too high an uncertainty to be significant , owing to the Poissonian statistics of molecule positions in space ( Supplementary Note ) . However , binning the data over  100 gene loci should allow the signal to emerge above the noise , and this is indeed what we observed ( Supplementary Fig . 14 ) . To convert the enrichment signal to the number of bound Bcd molecules , we normalized by the corresponding value measured for the bcd3 - lacZ construct , for which the number of bound Bcd proteins at saturating concentration was assumed to be 3 ( Supplementary Fig . 14 and Supplementary Note ) . Applying the procedure above , we measured an average binding of 5 . 36 ± 0 . 10 Bcd proteins at the hb locus ( calculated from > 21 , 000 loci in 31 embryos ; Supplementary Fig . 14 ) , which is close to the numbers we estimated above from the gene regulation function and the stochastic analysis of hb transcription . In contrast , measuring Bcd binding at a random position in the same nuclei yielded a value of 0 . 04 ± 0 . 09 . We compared our estimation of Bcd binding at three gene loci ( hb , Act5C and nullo ) to published ChIP - chip data 17 ( Supplementary Note ) and found good agreement between the two data sets ( Fig . 3b ) . Next , we examined how Bcd binding at hb varied with nuclear Bcd concentration . The measured curves ( Fig . 3c and Supplementary Fig . 15 ) exhibited plateaus suggestive of distinct binding states , with sharp transitions between these plateaus , consistent with the highly cooperative binding by Bcd at hb 18 .

This value is again roughly consistent with our previous conclusion that Bcd activates hb transcription through the cooperative binding of six or seven molecules . At higher Bcd concentrations , the transition to other binding states ( Fig . 3c and Supplementary Fig . 15 ) is not accompanied by a noticeable change in hb transcription . We speculate that these binding states corre - spond to the occupation of additional Bcd binding sites , possibly at other hb enhancers 19 . Our analysis above of hb activity and Bcd binding showed dis - tinct differences between nuclear cleavage cycles 11 – 13 and cycle 14 ( Supplementary Figs . 2 , 6 , 7 and 15 ) , consistent with previous reports that hb expression in cycle 14 is subject to additional regulation 19 . To further probe hb regulation during cycle 14 , we focused on the role of its own gene product , the Hb transcription factor . Hb is believed to regulate hb expression , but it is debated whether Hb serves as an activator 20 or a repressor 19 and how it interacts with other transcription factors such as Bcd 13 . We simul - taneously measured the binding of Bcd and Hb at each active hb locus ( Supplementary Figs . 16 and 17 and Supplementary Note ) . Analysis of the full data set ( Bcd binding , Hb binding and nascent hb mRNA ) revealed that higher Bcd binding is accompanied by higher hb expression , whereas higher Hb binding is accompa - nied by lower hb expression ( Fig . 3d and Supplementary Fig . 18 ) . Thus , the simultaneous binding data confirmed the positive regulatory effect of Bcd while demonstrating a repressive effect of Hb binding . We have shown that the simultaneous quantification of tran - scription factors and nascent mRNA in individual nuclei and individual gene loci , followed by three layers of analysis—average transcriptional response , mRNA statistics and transcription factor binding—provides a powerful approach for investigating the stochastic process of gene regulation . In our analysis , we took advantage of the natural variation in Bcd concentration across nuclei in a single embryo . Yet even in the absence of a well - defined gradient ( as found for morphogens and the transcription factors they regulate 21 ) , the natural cell - to - cell fluctuations in transcription factor levels are often significant 22 and span— ipso facto —the physiologically relevant range of regulatory concentrations , thereby extending the scenarios that can be investigated using this approach . When needed , a transcription factor can also be artificially expressed ( or depleted ) in order to scan a broader range of concentrations 23 . The ability to delineate the combinatorial activity of multiple transcription factors acting on the same gene is an especially promising application of our approach , as this remains a major challenge to our ability to decipher the genetic networks that drive cell behavior . methods Methods and any associated references are available in the online version of the paper .

( ii ) smFISH hybridization requires higher reaction temperature and harsher chemicals ( ≥ 30 °C , usually with forma - mide 5 ) than immunofluorescence ( 4 – 24 °C , no harsh chemicals 28 ) . ( iii ) smFISH is RNase sensitive , whereas many immunofluores - cence reagents , including blocking reagents and antibodies , are usually not RNase free . To combine smFISH and immunofluorescence labeling , we tested three different protocol designs : ( 1 ) smFISH and immun - ofluorescence labeling in the same reaction 5 , ( 2 ) immunofluores - cence labeling followed by smFISH 29 – 31 and ( 3 ) smFISH labeling followed by immunofluorescence 6 , 16 . For each protocol , we char - acterized the following quantities : ( i ) the average smFISH inten - sity of the hb gene at the anterior side of the embryo ( cycles 11 – 13 , 0 . 25 – 0 . 4 EL ) and ( ii ) the exponential slope ( decay length ) of the Bcd immunofluorescence signal . We found that , compared to smFISH - and immunofluorescence - only labeling , both design 1 and design 2 resulted in a decrease of the hb smFISH signal as well as a decrease of the Bcd immunofluorescence decay length , indicating that both smFISH and immunofluorescence signals have been distorted . In contrast , design 3 preserved both the smFISH intensity and the immunofluorescence slope . We there - fore developed a combined labeling protocol based on design 3 . In this protocol , the smFISH labeling procedure was adapted from previous protocols 5 , 32 . Sets of DNA oligonucleotides com - plementary to the target gene ( 48 probes for hb , 72 probes for lacZ , 48 probes for Act5C and 20 probes for nullo ; Supplementary Table 1 ) were designed and ordered ( Biosearch Technologies ) . hb probes were directly synthesized with 3 ′ TAMRA labeling ; all other probes were synthesized with 3 ′ amine modification and were conjugated to various fluorophores in the lab , as described in ref . 32 . Before hybridization , embryos were rehydrated four times ( 10 min each ) in 1 ml PBTx ( 1× PBS , 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 ) and washed twice ( 5 min each ) in 1 ml hybridization wash buffer ( 2× SSC , 20 % ( w / v ) formamide , 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 ) . Hybridization was then performed at 30 °C for 16 h by incubat - ing embryos with 100 nM of probes ( or roughly 2 nM per probe ) in 50 µ l hybridization buffer ( 2× SSC , 20 % ( w / v ) formamide , 0 . 2 mg / ml BSA ( RNase free , Ambion AM2616 ) , 2 mM ribonu - cleoside vanadyl complex ( NEB S1402S ) , 1 mg / ml Escherichia coli tRNA ( Sigma 83854 - 100MG ) , 0 . 1 g / ml dextran sulfate ) . A shaker was used to facilitate mixing . Hybridized embryos were washed three times ( 30 min each ) in hybridization wash buffer at 30 °C and twice ( 10 min each ) in 2× SSC ( with 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 ) at room temperature . All washing steps were performed with nutation . Immunofluorescence was performed after smFISH , using a protocol adapted from refs . 28 , 33 . Briefly , embryos were washed four times ( 10 min each ) in 1 ml PBTx and blocked in 1 ml PBT - B ( 1× PBS , 20 % ( v / v ) western blocking reagent ( Roche 11921673001 ) , 2 mM ribonucleoside vanadyl complex ( NEB S1402S ) , 0 . 1 % ( v / v ) Triton X - 100 ) at room temperature for 1 h . 500 µ l of rabbit anti - Bcd primary antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology SC - 66818 , 1 : 50 ( v / v ) dilution in PBT - B ) or guinea pig anti - Hb primary antibody 28 ( gift of J . Reinitz , 1 : 200 ( v / v ) dilution in PBT - B ) were preabsorbed ( incubated with stage 15 or 16 wild - type embryos at 4 °C for 20 h ) and then hybridized with the embryos of interest at 4 °C for 20 h . This was followed by four additional washes ( 10 min each ) in 1 ml PBTx and a 1 - h blocking in 1 ml PBT - B . Next , embryos were incubated with 500 µ l of either goat anti - rabbit or goat anti – guinea pig IgG secondary antibodies conjugated with either Alexa 488 or Alexa 647 ( Invitrogen , A11008 , A21244 , A11073 , 1 : 500 ( v / v ) dilution in PBT - B ) at room temperature for 1 h and washed four times ( 10 min each ) in 1 ml PBTx . All steps were performed with nutation . DNA staining and embryo mounting . After immunofluores - cence labeling , embryos were stained with 1 ml Hoechst 33342 ( Invitrogen P36236 , 1 : 10 , 000 ( v / v ) dilution in PBTx ) for 10 min on a nutator and washed four times ( 10 min each , with nutation ) in 1 ml PBTx before mounting in Aqua - Poly / Mount ( Polysciences 18606 ) . Imaging was performed at least 36 h after mounting to allow complete solidification of the sample . n p g © 201 5 N a t u r e A m e r i ca , I n c .

Embryos at the mitotic interphase of nuclear cleavage cycles 11 – 14 were selected on the basis of the number and shape of the nuclei ( Hoechst sig - nal ) and the appearance of bright spots in the smFISH channel . Three adjacent image stacks , with typical size of ~ 2 , 300 × 2 , 700 × 23 voxels each , were acquired automatically and stitched together ( using the “tiling” function of the LSM710 imaging software ) to cover the cortex layer of each embryo . Before image acquisition , the microscope was warmed up for at least 3 h to avoid possible drift of the focal plane . Data and code availability .
