The dendritic nucleation model describes the reorganization processes of actin arrays in lamellipodia ( Carlier et al . , 2003 ; Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) . Within the lamellipodia , actin fi laments display a branched network ( Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ) . The Arp2 / 3 complex nu - cleates actin fi laments off the sides of preexisting fi laments ( Mullins et al . , 1998 ; Welch et al . , 1998 ; Amann and Pollard , 2001 ; Fujiwara et al . , 2002 ) . Nucleated fi laments elongate to - ward the leading edge ( Small et al . , 1978 ) , and their growth is terminated by capping protein ( CP ; Mejillano et al . , 2004 ; Wear and Cooper , 2004 ) . Actin then depolymerizes to replen - ish the monomeric actin pool for the next round of polymer - ization . Quantitative modeling of the dendritic nucleation actin array is a logical goal in cell migration research , but it will require precise knowledge on the mechanisms governing actin fi lament turnover in vivo . Our previous study using single - molecule speckle mi - croscopy investigated actin fi lament lifetime distribution in lamellipodia of spreading Xenopus laevis fi broblasts ( Watanabe and Mitchison , 2002 ) . The fi lament lifetime spanned a wide range of time with a maximum of 148 s . Notably , one third of the fi laments had a short lifetime of < 10 s . This raised the question of what mechanisms may account for the observed lifetime of actin fi laments . In this study , we further extend our single - molecule speckle analysis to major actin end - binding proteins to eluci - date the fi lament turnover mechanism . Single - molecule ob - servations allow us to precisely measure the dissociation kinetics of a molecule in cells given that the molecule binds cellular structures on the order of seconds . Surprisingly , the dissociation of CP from actin was found to occur three orders of magnitude faster in cells than in vitro and even much faster than the actin disassembly rate . We demonstrate that the CP dissociation rate is prolonged under the several conditions in which actin fi laments are stabilized .

To elucidate the mecha - nism of actin disassembly , we characterized molecular ki - netics of the major ﬁ lament end - binding proteins Arp2 / 3 complex and capping protein ( CP ) using single - molecule speckle microscopy . We have determined the dissociation rates of Arp2 / 3 and CP as 0 . 048 and 0 . 58 s − 1 , respec - tively , in lamellipodia of live XTC ﬁ broblasts . This CP dis - sociation rate is three orders of magnitude faster than in vitro . CP dissociates slower from actin stress ﬁ bers than from the lamellipodial actin network , suggesting that CP dissociation correlates with actin ﬁ lament dynamics . We found that jasplakinolide , an actin depolymerization in - hibitor , rapidly blocked the fast CP dissociation in cells . Consistently , the coexpression of LIM kinase prolonged CP speckle lifetime in lamellipodia . These results suggest that coﬁ lin - mediated actin disassembly triggers CP dissocia - tion from actin ﬁ laments . We predict that ﬁ lament sever - ing and end - to - end annealing might take place fairly frequently in the dendritic nucleation actin arrays .

Based on the marked difference in the dissociation rate between actin ( 0 . 03 s − 1 ) and CP ( 0 . 58 s − 1 ) , we predict that fairly frequent fi lament severing and end - to - end annealing might take place in the dendritic nucleation actin arrays . Results Fast dissociation kinetics of CP in lamellipodia CP has been attributed to most of the actin capping activity in cell lysates ( DiNubile et al . , 1995 ; Hug et al . , 1995 ) and has been found as an essential protein in the regulation of lamelli - podium morphology ( Rogers et al . , 2003 ) . Therefore , we ana - lyzed the dynamics of CP to elucidate the state of barbed ends in the dendritic nucleation network . We generated three ex - pression constructs by tagging either the α or β subunit of Xenopus CP with an EGFP . Of the three , two probes , EGFP - CP β 1 and CP β 1 - EGFP , distributed to lamellipodia , which is consistent with previous studies ( Schafer et al . , 1998 ; Mejillano et al . , 2004 ) . EGFP - CP β 1 and CP β 1 - EGFP speckles moved along with the retrograde actin fl ow , which suggested their as - sociation with actin structures ( Fig . 1 A and Videos 1 and 2 , avail - able at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200604176 / DC1 ) . We selected these two probes for single - molecule speckle anal - ysis of CP . We measured the lifetime distribution of single - molecule CP speckles in lamellipodia of XTC cells spreading on poly - l - lysine ( PLL ) – coated glass coverslips . EGFP - CP β 1 and CP β 1 - EGFP showed a similar lifetime distribution ( Fig . 1 , B and C ) . Our measurement revealed that 53 – 60 % of CP dissociated from actin within 1 s . When the CP lifetime distribution was fi t with a single exponential curve , the half - life was 1 . 20 and 1 . 23 s for EGFP - CP β 1 and CP β 1 - EGFP , respectively , which is in marked contrast to the slow dissociation of CP from barbed ends in vitro ( t 1 / 2 = (cid:6) 28 min ; Schafer et al . , 1996 ) . CP displayed similar lifetime distributions throughout lamellipodia ( Fig . 1 D ) . We next examined the spatial location of CP recruitment . We recorded positions of newly appearing CP speckles and measured the distance from the cell edge . Although CP speckles appeared most frequently in the tip region , appearance was widely distributed throughout the lamellipodia ( Fig . 1 E ) . This bias toward the lamellipodium tip region was weaker than that observed for the Arp2 / 3 complex ( see Fig . 3 E ) . Given this unexpectedly fast dissociation , we needed to test whether our EGFP - tagged CP probes retained high affi n - ity to barbed ends . We characterized biochemical properties of the recombinant CP α 2 / EGFP - CP β 1 heterodimer expressed in Escherichia coli ( Fig . 2 A ) . First , we determined the on - rate constant ( k on ) of CP α 2 / EGFP - CP β 1 using a pyrene - actin po - lymerization assay ( Fig . 2 B ) . Low concentrations of CP α 2 / EGFP - CP β 1 effi ciently inhibited barbed end elongation from fi lamentous actin ( F - actin ) seeds . The on - rate constant was calculated to be 3 . 9 μ M − 1 s − 1 , which was comparable with that of native CP ( 3 . 5 – 5 . 7 μ M − 1 s − 1 ; Schafer et al . , 1996 ) . Second , we measured the dissociation constant ( K d ) using a pyrene - actin steady - state assay ( Fig . 2 C ) . The K d of CP α 2 / EGFP - CP β 1 with barbed ends was 1 . 3 nM , which was com - parable with the K d of native CP ( 0 . 06 – 1 nM ; Caldwell et al . , 1989 ; Casella and Torres , 1994 ; Schafer et al . , 1996 ) . The K d and on - rate constant predict an off - rate constant of 5 . 1 (cid:2) 10 − 3 s − 1 , which is (cid:6) 100 - fold smaller than the dissociation rate of our CP probes in lamellipodia ( Fig . 1 , B and C ) . We also noted that recombinant EGFP - CP β 1 , which was expressed and puri - fi ed in the absence of CP α subunits , did not interfere with actin elongation ( unpublished data ) . This is consistent with previous fi ndings ( Casella and Torres , 1994 ) . Therefore , CP speckles observed in cells should correspond to EGFP - CP β 1 coupled with endogenous CP α subunits but not defi cient EGFP - CP β 1 monomers . To further evaluate the fi delity of our CP probes , we per - meabilized cells expressing EGFP - CP β 1 using Triton X - 100 and followed the decay of EGFP fl uorescence . The decay rate of fl uorescence intensity was 1 . 7 × 10 − 4 s − 1 in lamellipodia Figure 1 . Lifetime distribution of single - molecule CP speckles in lamellipodia .

Cells retained most of the expressed CP speckles during the permeabilization procedure ( Fig . 2 E ) , eliminating the possibility that our permeabilization procedure selected a specifi c fraction of CP tightly bound to actin . These results indicate that our CP probes bind barbed ends with a high affi nity , similar to that measured for unmodifi ed protein in vitro ( Caldwell et al . , 1989 ; Casella and Torres , 1994 ; Schafer et al . , 1996 ) . All together , our CP probes can be used as a reliable marker to monitor the dynamics of CP . We conclude that fast dissociation kinetics of CP speckles represent the dynamics of endogenous CP . To test whether other barbed end interactors might cap ac - tin tightly , we visualized the molecular dynamics of Eps8 , VASP , and gelsolin ( Fig . S1 and Videos 3 – 7 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200604176 / DC1 ; Witke et al . , 1995 ; Bear et al . , 2002 ; Croce et al . , 2004 ; Disanza et al . , 2004 ; Barzik et al . , 2005 ) . None of the three molecules displayed long - term association with the actin network . These results suggest that the majority of actin fi laments may release barbed end cappers and revert to the growing phase quickly in lamellipodia . Kinetics of the Arp2 / 3 complex in lamellipodia We next examined the molecular dynamics of the Arp2 / 3 complex in lamellipodia . We generated expression constructs by tagging each of seven Xenopus Arp2 / 3 subunits with EGFP , testing N - and C - terminal fusions in several cases . Among them , four probes— EGFP - p40 , p40 - EGFP , EGFP - p21 , and p21 - EGFP—were localized to lamellipodia and cytoplasmic punctate actin structures , which is consistent with the reported Arp2 / 3 localization ( Mullins et al . , 1997 ; Welch et al . , 1997 ; Schafer et al . , 1998 ; Svitkina and Borisy , 1999 ) . Using an anti - p40 antibody , we confi rmed that distributions of EGFP - p21 and p21 - EGFP were identical to that of the endogenous p40 subunit of Arp2 / 3 ( Fig . S2 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200604176 / DC1 ) . We also compared localization of the four probes with each other by generating probes tagged with monomeric red fl uorescent protein 1 ( mRFP1 ; Campbell et al . , 2002 ) . All four probes showed identical localization ( Fig . S2 ) and moved inward at the same rate as the retrograde actin fl ow . Based on these observations , we selected these four probes for further analysis . We analyzed the kinetics of Arp2 / 3 dissociation from the actin network in lamellipodia . We followed each newly emerged single - molecule Arp2 / 3 speckle and measured the duration between its appearance and disappearance ( Fig . 3 , A – D ; and Video 8 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200604176 / DC1 ) . Arp2 / 3 interacts with the side of actin fi laments with micromolar affi nity ( Mullins et al . , 1997 ; Gournier et al . , 2001 ) . Thus , Arp2 / 3 is expected to dissociate from the side of the fi lament on a subsecond timescale after leaving the pointed end , and rapidly dissociating side binding would not be detected using our current experimental settings . Therefore , we interpret that the lifetime of Arp2 / 3 speckles represents the duration of Arp2 / 3 association with the pointed end , although we do not know whether Arp2 / 3 dissociation occurs simultaneously with debranching . The lifetime distri - bution of Arp2 / 3 speckles could be approximated by a single exponential curve , which suggests that the dissociation of Arp2 / 3 is governed by a single rate - limiting step . Half - life determined for four Arp2 / 3 probes yielded similar values that spanned 12 . 5 to 16 . 9 s . The half - life of Arp2 / 3 speckles is about half of Figure 2 .

JCB • VOLUME 175 • NUMBER 6 • 2006 950 that of actin fi laments in lamellipodia of XTC cells ( Watanabe and Mitchison , 2002 ) . Next , we examined the spatial location of Arp2 / 3 recruit - ment by recording positions of newly appearing speckles . Although Arp2 / 3 speckles appeared throughout lamellipodia , appearance was heavily biased to a zone within 0 . 5 μ m from the cell edge ( Fig . 3 E ) . This bias was greater than that previously observed for actin speckles ( Watanabe and Mitchison , 2002 ) and suggests that most Arp2 / 3 - driven nucleation occurs in the tip region of the leading edge , where known Arp2 / 3 activators are localized ( Nakagawa et al . , 2001 ) . The mean lifetime of Arp2 / 3 did not change throughout lamellipodia , although Arp2 / 3 with prolonged lifetime was observed more frequently in the cell edge region than in the rest of lamellipodia ( Fig . 3 F ) . Less dynamic behavior of CP bound to actin stress ﬁ bers Under our normal observation conditions , up to 2 h after cells were seeded on PLL - coated coverslips , our CP probes were pre - dominantly colocalized with Arp2 / 3 in lamellipodia and cyto - plasmic punctate actin structures ( Fig . 4 A ) . When cells were allowed to grow for another several hours , CP probes were also associated with actin stress fi bers ( SFs ; Fig . 4 B ) . The similar localization of CP to myofi brillar structures in cultured cardio - myocytes has been reported previously ( Schafer et al . , 1994 ) . We noticed that a fraction of CP speckles stayed stably associ - ated with SFs , whereas CP speckles that did not localize with Figure 3 .

SEVERING - DRIVEN FAST CAPPING PROTEIN DISSOCIATION • MIYOSHI ET AL . 951 SFs in the lamella region emerged and disappeared as quickly as in lamellipodia . When subjected to speckle regression analysis ( Watanabe and Mitchison , 2002 ) , the decay rate of persistent CP speckles located on SFs was slower than that of CP in the other area of lamella ( Fig . 4 B ) . These results suggest that CP dissociation is differentially regulated in distinct actin structures and that the dissociation rate of CP may be correlated with the actin fi lament turnover rate . Attenuation of fast CP dissociation by the inhibition of actin disassembly Next , we examined the effect of stabilization of actin fi laments on the dissociation kinetics of CP . We tested jasplakinolide ( Jas ) , an actin depolymerization inhibitor ( Bubb et al . , 2000 ) that in - duces a three - to fourfold increase in the half - life of actin fi la - ments within 1 min in lamellipodia ( Watanabe and Mitchison , 2002 ) . We observed a rapid , marked prolongation of CP speckle lifetime upon treatment with 1 μ M Jas ( Fig . 5 and Video 9 , avail - able at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200604176 / DC1 ) . This fi nding is striking , as the half - life of actin fi lament turnover ( (cid:6) 30 s ; Watanabe and Mitchison , 2002 ) greatly ( (cid:6) 20 - fold ) ex - ceeds that of CP , and it is a counterintuitive phenomenon that inhibiting the disassembly of a network system has a strong im - pact on the kinetics of its associated molecule , which displays much faster binding - dissociation kinetics . To confi rm this , we tested whether the inactivation of cofi lin , a major actin depolymerizing factor implicated in lamel - lipodium formation ( Bamburg , 1999 ; Chan et al . , 2000 ; Nagata - Ohashi et al . , 2004 ) , may also have similar effects . LIM kinase ( LIMK ) phosphorylates cofi lin and prevents the interaction between cofi lin and actin ( Yang et al . , 1998 ) . We generated an expression construct for mRFP1 - tagged human LIMK ( mRFP1 – hLIMK - 1 ) to examine the effect of various levels of LIMK - 1 expression on CP . It was confi rmed that cells expressing mRFP1 – hLIMK - 1 displayed slower actin fi lament turnover ( Fig . S3 and Video 10 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200604176 / DC1 ) , which is consistent with previous fi ndings ( Hotulainen et al . , 2005 ) . The decay rate of persistent CP speckles in lamellipodia was also markedly pro - longed in cells expressing mRFP1 – hLIMK - 1 , and this effect was correlated with the expression level of mRFP1 – hLIMK - 1 ( Fig . 6 ) . These results indicate that cofi lin - mediated actin dis - assembly is responsible for the fast dissociation kinetics of CP in lamellipodia . Because three different conditions of actin fi la - ment stabilization led to the prolongation of CP speckle life - time ( Figs . 4 – 6 ) , fi lament severing may frequently take place in lamellipodia , which could lead to the fast dissociation of CP from the actin network . Discussion This study reveals the astoundingly fast dissociation kinetics of CP in lamellipodia . In vitro , native CP binds barbed ends with subnanomolar affi nities , and CP dissociates from barbed ends at a very slow rate ( (cid:6) 0 . 0004 s − 1 ; Caldwell et al . , 1989 ; Casella and Torres , 1994 ; Schafer et al . , 1996 ) . In contrast , our CP probes displayed three orders of magnitude faster dis - sociation kinetics in cells . Several studies have already sug - gested the weak interaction of CP with barbed ends in cell lysates . Nearly 1 μ M of free barbed ends are present despite (cid:6) 1 – 2 μ M CP being present in lysates obtained from Dictyo - stelium discoideum cells ( Hug et al . , 1995 ) and neutrophils ( DiNubile et al . , 1995 ) . The dissociation constant of CP in cell lysates was estimated to be (cid:6) 0 . 1 μ M ( Hug et al . , 1995 ) . The weak affi nity of CP to barbed ends has now been confi rmed by our data obtained using intact cells . Moreover , our results conclude that the fast dissociation of CP , but not its slow asso - ciation as postulated ( Hug et al . , 1995 ) , is responsible for the weak capping activity . Attenuation of the fast dissociation of CP probes upon permeabilization can be explained by the removal of CP dissociation promoters such as phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate ( Schafer et al . , 1996 ) and CARMIL ( Yang et al . , 2005 ) . An unidentifi ed anti - CP factor that differs from VASP and CARMIL has also been reported previously ( Huang et al . , 2005 ) . Figure 5 . Rapid , marked stabilization of CP upon Jas treatment . Images of EGFP - CP β 1 speckles in live XTC cells were acquired at 2 - s intervals before perfusion and at 10 - s intervals 1 min after the perfusion of 1 μ M Jas . The decay of persistent single - molecule CP speckles before ( circles ) and (cid:6) 1 – 5 min after ( triangles ) perfusion is shown . The normalized half - life of persistent CP speckles rapidly increased from 4 . 26 ( solid line ) to 68 . 9 s ( dotted line ) upon Jas treatment . A representative result of three measure - ments is shown . Figure 6 . The dissociation rate of CP speckles is reduced by coexpression of LIMK . XTC cells were transfected with various ratios of the mixture of delCMV - EGFP - CP β 1 and pmRFP1 – hLIMK - 1 and were allowed to spread on PLL - coated coverslips for 0 . 5 – 2 h . Circles show the half - life of single - molecule CP speckles in lamellipodia of cells ( n = 4 ) transfected with delCMV - EGFP - CP β 1 alone .

JCB • VOLUME 175 • NUMBER 6 • 2006 952 Twinfi lin , a barbed end – interacting protein with a G - actin se - questering activity ( Helfer et al . , 2006 ) , interacts directly with CP without affecting the interaction of CP with barbed ends ( Falck et al . , 2004 ) . These molecules may contribute to the fast dissociation of CP . However , based on our fi ndings of the strong dependency of the CP dissociation rate on actin fi la - ment turnover ( Figs . 4 – 6 ) , we propose that cofi lin - mediated fi lament severing may trigger the dissociation of CP from the dendritic nucleation actin arrays . Possible mechanisms for actin fi lament turnover – dependent CP dissociation are depicted in Fig . 7 ( A – C ) . Jas might strengthen CP – actin interaction by affecting fi lament conformation ( Fig . 7 A ) . However , because CP alone can bind F - actin with a very high affi nity , further stabilization of CP – barbed end interaction by Jas seems questionable . Alternatively , fi lament severing induced by cofi lin may possibly trigger the dissociation of CP attached to a small ac - tin oligomer . Jas , which binds actin fi laments competitively with phalloidin ( Bubb et al . , 1994 ) , probably exerts antisevering effects in a similar manner to phalloidin . If fi lament severing by cofi lin triggers fast CP dissociation , there must be a mech - anism that prevents the actin network from equally fast break - down . Disassembly of actin fi laments ( t 1 / 2 = 30 s ; Watanabe and Mitchison , 2002 ) is (cid:6) 20 - fold slower than the dissociation of CP in lamellipodia of XTC cells . One possible explanation is that cofi lin may sever actin fi laments preferentially near the barbed end ( Fig . 7 B ) . Another possibility is that cofi lin - mediated severing occurs frequently throughout the actin arrays , and rapid end - to - end annealing may prevent severed actin oligomers from leaving the fi lament network ( Fig . 7 C ) . In vitro , rapid reannealing of sheared actin fi laments has long been recognized ( Nakaoka and Kasai , 1969 ; Carlier et al . , 1984 ; Andrianantoandro et al . , 2001 ) . Annealing appears to be a favorable reaction given the high density of actin fi laments , which is (cid:6) 1 , 000 μ M in lamellipodia ( Abraham et al . , 1999 ) . To gain evidence for fi lament annealing , we examined the dis - tribution of free fi lament ends using recombinant EGFP - tagged CP and tropomodulin ( Weber et al . , 1994 ) in permeabilized XTC cells . From the binding density of these fl uorescent probes to lamellipodia , the concentrations of free barbed ends and pointed ends were estimated to be 0 . 99 and 4 . 6 μ M , respectively ( Fig . S4 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200604176 / DC1 ) . The coexistence of high amounts of free barbed ends and pointed ends may support our hypothesis of frequent end - to - end fi lament annealing ( Fig . 7 C ) . The current dendritic nucleation models did not incor - porate end - to - end fi lament annealing as a dominant reaction because CP has been believed to terminate barbed end growth within 1 – 2 s after the nucleation of fi laments ( Carlier et al . , 2003 ; Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ) . Now , our fi nding of fast CP dissociation suggests that CP is not suffi cient to strictly block barbed ends in lamellipodia . The present study also tested whether other molecules exist that are capable of tightly cap - ping a major fraction of fi laments . Gelsolin − / − fi broblasts dis - play a reduced membrane ruffling response to EGF ( Witke et al . , 1995 ; Azuma et al . , 1998 ) . Eps8 − / − fi broblasts are defec - tive in membrane ruffl ing formation induced by PDGF ( Scita et al . , 1999 ) , and Caenorhabditis elegans lacking Eps8 dis - plays severe defects in the organization of intestinal brush border microvilli ( Croce et al . , 2004 ) . However , our data show that none of these barbed end factors , including gelsolin , Eps8 , and VASP , cap actin tightly in lamellipodia . Notably , the dissociation constant of Eps8 with barbed ends determined in vitro ( Disanza et al . , 2004 ) was also considerably lower than that observed in vivo . Collectively , these results suggest that free barbed ends are abundant in lamellipodia despite these cappers , whose affi nities to barbed ends are within the nanomolar range in vitro . Our fi ndings of the fast dissociation kinetics of these cappers from the actin network have opened up a possibility that end - to - end fi lament annealing may ubiq - uitously occur in lamellipodia . Fig . 4 D summarizes kinetics in regulation of the dendritic nucleation actin arrays . Our single - molecule speckle analysis revealed 0 . 048 and 0 . 58 s − 1 for the dissociation rates of Arp2 / 3 and CP , respectively . Another important notion is the fast actin Figure 7 . Models for actin dynamics – dependent fast CP dissociation and ﬁ lament turnover kinetics in the dendritic nucleation actin arrays . ( A ) Direct inhibition of CP dissociation by Jas . Jas might stabilize the CP – barbed end interaction through conformational changes in the ﬁ lament , and coﬁ lin might have the opposite effect . ( B ) Preferential ﬁ lament severing near the barbed end . Both models ( A and B ) predict an unknown barbed end – speciﬁ c regulation in the mechanism of coﬁ lin - mediated actin disassembly . ( C ) Alternatively , ﬁ lament severing might occur at a high frequency . In this model , end - to - end annealing will be required to prevent fast actin disassembly and uncontrolled growth of free barbed ends . Because CP dissociates one order of magnitude faster than actin and Arp2 / 3 , this model predicts that severing may occur several times in a single ﬁ lament before disassembly . ( D ) Summary of the kinetics of actin ﬁ lament turnover regulation . The present single - molecule speckle analysis revealed 0 . 048 and 0 . 58 s − 1 for the dis - sociation rates of Arp2 / 3 and CP , respectively . We have also reevaluated the speed to the FH2 mutant of mDia1 in lamellipodia and determined the growth rate of free barbed ends as (cid:6) 66 subunits / s ( Fig . S5 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200604176 / DC1 ) . Thus , the growth of barbed ends is not strictly limited by capping , whereas disassem - bly from the Arp2 / 3 - bound pointed ends starts slowly . Therefore , we predict that ﬁ lament severing is required to achieve fast actin disassembly in lamellipodia . End - to - end ﬁ lament annealing probably contributes to the neu - tralization of free barbed ends generated by nucleation and severing . Our data also predict that CP as well as a fraction of actin may dissociate from the network as small actin oligomers . SEVERING - DRIVEN FAST CAPPING PROTEIN DISSOCIATION • MIYOSHI ET AL . 953 elongation in living cells as revealed by the actin polymerization – driven movement of mDia1 ( Higashida et al . , 2004 ) . Based on the speed of mDia1F2 ( Fig . S5 , available at http : / / www . jcb . org / cgi / content / full / jcb . 200604176 / DC1 ) , we estimate that free barbed ends may elongate at (cid:6) 66 subunits / s in lamellipodia . Together with the fast dissociation kinetics of CP , these results suggest that barbed end growth is not strictly restricted as previously postulated . Given the relatively free and fast barbed end growth , we also predict the requirement of fi lament severing in cata - lyzing the fast actin disassembly in lamellipodia based on kinetic modeling ( unpublished data ) . Filament severing is also relevant , as it seems indispensable to facilitate fast actin turnover ( Theriot and Mitchison , 1991 ; Watanabe and Mitchison , 2002 ) in the presence of actin fi laments of several microns in length found in lamellipodia ( Small et al . , 1995 ) . Collectively , we predict that fi lament severing and its counteracting reaction , end - to - end annealing , may take place frequently in lamellipodia . Filament severing and end - to - end annealing could play a pivotal role in leading edge dynamics by rapidly changing the direction of growth , length distribution , disassembly , and polarity of the actin fi lament arrays . Currently , it is diffi cult to estimate the frequency of these two inverse reac - tions in cells . However , our fi nding of the fast CP dissociation kinetics may imply a severing frequency of up to one per second for an actin fi lament of several tens of subunits in length . Further studies will be required to test this high frequency severing - annealing hypothesis . Materials and methods Plasmids and reagents EST clones encoding subunits of Xenopus Arp2 / 3 , CP , and other actin - related proteins were obtained from the IMAGE consortium . GenBank / EMBL / DDBJ accession no . for sequence data are as follows : EF011871 ( Arp3 ) , EF011865 ( Arp2 ) , EF011872 ( p40 ) , EF011864 ( p34 ) , EF011866 ( p21 ) , EF011870 ( p20 ) , EF011868 ( p16 ) , BC060481 ( CP α 1 ) , BC072853 ( CP α 2 ) , EF011869 ( CP β 1 ) , BC072836 ( VASP ) , BC084059 ( gelsolin ) , and EF011867 ( tropomodulin ) . Each cDNA was subcloned into the pEGFP - C1 ( CLONTECH Laboratories , Inc . ) – derived vector harboring the defective cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) promoter ( Watanabe and Mitchison , 2002 ) delCMV - EGFP - C1 . mRFP1 fusion constructs were generated by replacing EGFP sequences with mRFP1 cDNA ( gift from R . Y . Tsien , University of California , San Diego , San Diego , CA ; Campbell et al . , 2002 ) . Full - length pEGFP - Eps8 was described previously ( Scita et al . , 2001 ) . pmRFP1 – hLIMK - 1 was constructed by introducing wild - type human LIMK - 1 cDNA ( gift from K . Mizuno , Tohoku University , Sendai , Japan ; Yang et al . , 1998 ) into the mRFP1 expression vector . Jas was purchased from Calbiochem . Antibody and immunocytochemistry The guinea pig anti - p40 antibody was raised against the 6xHis - tagged p40 subunit using pET - 30a ( Novagen ) . For immunocytochemistry , cells were extracted with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in Cytoskeleton buffer ( CB ; 10 mM MES , pH 6 . 1 , 90 mM KCl , 3 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM EGTA , and 0 . 16 M sucrose ) for 10 s and ﬁ xed with 3 . 7 % PFA in CB for 20 min at room temperature . Texas red – X phalloidin ( Invitrogen ) was used for staining F - actin . AlexaFluor488 and - 594 anti – guinea pig IgG ( Invitrogen ) were used as secondary antibodies . Live cell imaging and ﬂ uorescent speckle microscopy Speckle imaging was performed as described previously ( Watanabe and Mitchison , 2002 ) . In brief , cells were allowed to spread on a PLL - coated glass coverslip attached to a ﬂ ow cell in 70 % Leibovitz’s L15 medium ( Invitrogen ) without serum . The ﬂ ow cell was placed on the stage of a microscope ( BX52 or IX71 ; Olympus ) equipped with either 100 - W mercury or 75 - W Xenon illumination and with a cooled CCD camera ( MMX1300 - YHS , CoolSNAP HQ , or Cascade II : 512 ; Roper Scientiﬁ c ; or UIC - QE ; Molecular Devices ) . Time - lapse imaging was performed at 21 – 23 ° C using MetaMorph software ( Universal Imaging Corp . ) up to 120 min after cells were seeded . Fluorescent speckle microscopy was performed by observing cells expressing a low amount of EGFP - tagged proteins using a planApo 100 × NA 1 . 40 oil objective ( Olympus ) . A re - stricted area near the cell edge was illuminated . Speckle lifetime mea - surement was performed by tracking individual speckles manually . The photobleaching rate of EGFP probes was measured by illuminating entire cell areas under an identical condition on the day of each experiment . Normalization for photobleaching was described previously ( Watanabe and Mitchison , 2002 ) . Decay rate measurement of CP probes in permeabilized cells XTC cells expressing EGFP - CP β 1 or CP β 1 - EGFP were permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in CB for 10 s , and the medium was replaced with a buffer ( 10 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , and 1 mM DTT ) . Time - lapse images were acquired at intervals of 5 min . Illumination was attenuated using neutral density ﬁ lters so that ﬂ uores - cence decay caused by photobleaching was negligible . EGFP ﬂ uorescence intensity was measured in a cell peripheral region after the subtraction of background values obtained in an area outside of the cell . Puriﬁ cation of the recombinant CP 𝛂 2 / EGFP - CP 𝛃 1 heterodimer pGEX - CP α 2 was generated by inserting CP α 2 cDNA into pGEX - 2T ( GE Healthcare ) . pET - 30 - EGFP - CP β 1 was generated by replacing 6xHis sequences in pET - 30a ( Novagen ) with the EGFP - CP β 1 coding sequences . Using electroporation , BL21 Star ( DE3 ; Invitrogen ) harboring the pG - KJE8 chaperon plasmid ( Takara ) was transformed with pGEX - CP α 2 and pET - 30 - EGFP - CP β 1 simultaneously . Subsequent cultures were performed under the selection pressure of ampicillin , kanamycin , and chloramphenocol . Cells were grown at 37 ° C in Luria - Bertani medium overnight . After subculturing into fresh media , chaperon proteins were induced , and , at OD 600 = 0 . 6 , 1 mM IPTG was added . Cells were cultured at 30 ° C for an additional 6 h and collected by centrifugation . Cells were then sonicated in buffer C ( 10 mM Tris - Cl , pH 7 . 5 , 300 mM NaCl , 1 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT , and 1 mM ATP ) supplemented with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , 200 μ M PMSF , 2 μ g / ml leupeptin , and 1 μ g / ml pepstatin A . The sonicate was clariﬁ ed by centrifugation . The supernatant was incubated with glutathione – Sepharose 4B ( GE Healthcare ) , and the beads were washed by repeated centrifugation with buffer C . The beads were incubated with thrombin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) in buffer C , and CP α 2 / EGFP - CP β 1 cleaved from GST was collected in the supernatant . Thrombin activity was neutralized with hirudin ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Pyrene - actin polymerization assay Pyrene - labeled actin and rabbit skeletal muscle actin were purchased from Cytoskeleton , Inc . Before use , the protein concentrations were veriﬁ ed using densitometry on the SDS - PAGE gel stained with Coomassie Brilliant blue . Unlabeled actin was polymerized at 5 μ M in buffer F ( 10 mM Tris - Cl , pH 7 . 5 , 100 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM ATP , 0 . 2 mM EGTA , and 0 . 2 mM DTT ) for 1 h . For assembly from F - actin seeds , a 12 . 5 - μ l aliquot of unlabeled , preassembled actin ﬁ laments was inserted into each well . To start the reaction , 6 . 67 μ l of a 15 - μ M pyrene - actin droplet in buffer G containing 0 . 2 mM ATP was washed into the F - actin seeds with 71 μ l of 1 . 2 × buffer F and 10 μ l of buffer C containing a range of concentrations of CP α 2 / EGFP - CP β 1 . Pyrene ﬂ uorescence was monitored at room temper - ature using Fluoroskan Ascent FL ( Labsystems ) . Determination of rate constants of the CP 𝛂 2 / EGFP - CP 𝛃 1 heterodimer The rate constants for capping barbed ends were determined from kinetic parameter optimization using data collected in actin polymerization assays . The concentration of F - actin seeds , [ S ] 0 , was ﬁ rst determined by ﬁ tting the ﬂ uorescence data without CP α 2 / EGFP - CP β 1 with the equation − + + = − − + 0 ( ) [ S ] Free 0 Poly [ A ] ( [ A ] ) ( 1 e ) , on on B P t off off on on B P B P where [ A Poly ] is the concentration of polymerized actin , [ A Free ] 0 is the initial concentration of free actin monomers , B on and B off are on and off rates of barbed ends , and P on and P off are on and off rates of pointed ends . Polymerization in the presence of CP α 2 / EGFP - CP β 1 is described as B + A Free = B , B + C = BC , and P + A Free = P , where A Free is free actin monomers , B is free barbed ends , P is free pointed ends , C is free CP , and BC is capped barbed ends . Using [ S ] 0 , actin polymerization curves JCB • VOLUME 175 • NUMBER 6 • 2006 954 were calculated numerically by Euler’s method . The on and off rates of CP α 2 / EGFP - CP β 1 were varied to ﬁ t calculated polymerization curves with pyrene - actin ﬂ uorescence data . Determination of the dissociation constant ( K d ) of CP 𝛂 2 / EGFP - CP 𝛃 1 heterodimer 2 μ M pyrene - labeled actin was polymerized for 2 h in buffer F . Various amounts of CP α 2 / EGFP - CP β 1 in 10 μ l of buffer C was added to 90 μ l of the polymerized pyrene - actin solutions . Samples were incubated for 24 h at 22 ° C , and pyrene ﬂ uorescence was measured . At steady state , + = + = Free Free [ B ] [ C ] [ B ] [ A ] [ P ] [ A ] [ B ] [ P ] and , [ BC ] on on d off off B P B P K where [ A Free ] is the concentration of free actin monomers , [ B ] is the concen - tration of free barbed ends , [ P ] is the concentration of free pointed ends , [ C ] is the concentration of free CP , and [ BC ] is the concentration of capped barbed ends . At CP concentrations of ≥ 1 nM , the concentration of free CP , [ C ] , is almost equal to its total concentration , [ C ] 0 . The concentration of polymer - ized actin is calculated by the following equation : + = − = + + Free 0 Poly 0 [ A ] [ A ] , where . [ C ] off off d on on d B X P K X B X P K The K d for CP α 2 / EGFP - CP β 1 was determined by optimizing this equation to ﬂ uorescence data . Online supplemental material Fig .
