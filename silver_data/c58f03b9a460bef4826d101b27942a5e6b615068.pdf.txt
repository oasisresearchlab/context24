Social media is gathering attention as a place to extract ideas efﬁciently ; however , the characteristics of ideas and the posters of ideas on social media are underexamined . Thus , this study aims to characterize spontaneous ideation contests among social media users by taking an event of Facebook’s name change to Meta as a case study . As a dataset , we comprehensively collect tweets containing new acronyms of Big Tech companies , which we treat as an “idea” in this work . In the analysis , we especially focus on the diversity of ideas , which would be the main reason for enlisting social media for idea generation . As the main results , we discovered that social media users offered a wider range of ideas than those in mainstream media . The follow - follower network of the users suggested that the users’ position on the network is related to the preferred ideas . Additionally , we discovered a link between the amount of user interaction on social media and the diversity of ideas . This study would promote the use of social media as a part of open innovation and co - creation processes in the industry .

I NTRODUCTION Creating , developing , or communicating new ideas is an essential process for every organization . Since ideas are the source of creativity and innovation , much attention has been paid in academia and industry to developing and integrating them within and across organizations [ 1 ] . In an effort to collect good ideas , industries have been using the outsourcing of idea generation [ 2 ] , especially in the form of ideation contest . The ideation contest gathers participants and asks them for new ideas ( e . g . , about products or solutions in business ) using crowdsourcing services and corporate platforms [ 3 ] , [ 4 ] . Companies such as Dell [ 3 ] , IBM [ 5 ] , and Starbucks [ 6 ] have succeeded in running the ideation contest to gather ideas and implement many of them . The great success in ideation contests has made companies explore the leverage of social media [ 7 ] . Social media is a place where a wide variety of ideas are posted and discussed on a daily basis [ 8 ] . This big data would allow organizations to solicit ideas from a more expansive space and gain ideas from the types of people who would otherwise be excluded [ 9 ] . Due to its potential , existing research Fig . 1 . Example of Idea tweet . has proposed using social media for collecting ideas [ 10 ] ; however , there is still a lack of understanding about how ideas are proposed on social media [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] . Therefore , this study characterizes idea generation behavior on social media . In particular , we analyze the diversity of ideas , an important concept when it comes to extracting ideas from social media . As data , we deal with the acronyms of the American Big Tech companies , which have been known as FANG ( Facebook , Amazon , Netﬂix , and Google ) or FAANG ( FANG + Apple ) [ 13 ] . In October 2021 , the name change of Facebook to Meta provided a unique opportunity to study a user - driven ideation contest on social media—“What should be a new acronym for Big Tech companies ? ” Since the renaming of one of the world’s top 10 companies by market capitalization was a phenomenal event , the discussion attracted many participants . In addition , an ideation contest about a name is referred to as a “naming contest” [ 14 ] , which is categorized as the most straightforward form of ideation contests [ 15 ] . Given these factors , Facebook’s name change to Meta can serve as a solid exemplar of ideation contests on social media , and the empirical analysis of this case would provide helpful insights into the ideation behaviors of users . To characterize this spontaneous ideation contest , we exhaustively collect tweets in the discussion on new acronyms of Big Tech companies , which we consider as an “idea” in this work ( an example is shown in Figure 1 ) , and examine them . After a ﬁrst look at collected tweets , we conducted analyses on the diversity of ideas , the relationship between the users and ideas , and how user interaction affects the diversity of ideas . From the collected tweets , we found 21 candidate acronyms a r X i v : 2204 . 00910v3 [ c s . S I ] 14 N o v 2022 for referring to new Big Tech companies . In the analyses of the diversity of ideas , we found that users on social media proposed a greater variety of ideas than those on mainstream media . The user’s follow - follower network indicated that net - work position is an important factor in affecting their ideation behavior . Furthermore , we found that the interactions between users on social media are associated with a greater diversity of ideas . Other than the analyses of the diversity of ideas , we charac - terized them in terms of the various metrics ( e . g . , shares , likes ) and temporal dynamics . Also , by looking at participants in detail , we found that the ﬁrst person to post ideas tends to have fewer followers , while those with more followers post ideas secondarily or share the ﬁrst posts . Finally , we conducted a regression analysis and found that the early participants of the users with more followers and negative posts were associated with more replies . As far as we know , this work is the ﬁrst case study to characterize spontaneous ideation contests on social media , and we obtained helpful insights for using social media for idea generation . Data and code will be published when accepted and published . We believe this study would promote the use of social media as a part of open innovation , co - creation processes , and the management of big data in the industry . II . R ELATED W ORKS A . Ideation Contest using Crowdsourcing and Corporate Plat - forms To establish an efﬁcient idea generation method , industries tried to study the mechanisms of idea generation in individu - als [ 16 ] , compare groups and individuals to determine which produce superior ideas [ 17 ] , and create an organizational system that facilitates idea generation from employees [ 18 ] . However , with the increasing speed of information sharing about products , competition in business is intensifying every year , and thus the demand for collecting good ideas is in - creasing further [ 19 ] . In this context , companies are increas - ingly outsourcing idea generation [ 2 ] . Incorporating external knowledge , such as open innovation [ 20 ] or co - creation [ 21 ] , is expected to accelerate internal innovation and reduce the risk of product failure as it helps to involve potential customers in idea generation [ 22 ] . Among the means to outsource external ideas , ideation contest using crowdsourcing services [ 3 ] and corporate ideation platforms [ 4 ] , which are mainly ﬁnancially incentivized [ 23 ] , is one of the leading choices [ 2 ] , [ 7 ] . Existing research summarized the types of ideation contests in addition to naming contests , such as graphic design and creative writing contests [ 15 ] . As for the analysis on the corporate ideation platform , Bayus analyzed their behavior and the quality of their ideas with respect to serial ideators and ideators with only one idea [ 3 ] . Hossain et al . analyzed the growth process of the platform and the relationship between the total number of ideas and the number of viable ideas [ 24 ] . In contrast , we analyze spontaneous ideation contests on social media , which have the advantage of obtaining various participants’ opinions with less bias than corporate ideation platforms [ 9 ] . B . Ideation Contest using Social Media The problem with ideation contests with crowdsourcing services and corporate platforms is that the number of participants is limited and sometimes biased [ 7 ] . In this context , the use of social media for ideation contests is gaining attention to supplement existing methods [ 7 ] . Social media is rich in various kinds of ideas , and there is a strong demand for methods to use these ideas in corporate innovation . Due to these properties , researchers have proposed the inclusion of social media information in the business innovation process [ 7 ] and demonstrated its beneﬁts theoretically [ 10 ] . In fact , many companies attempt to use social media to enhance their innovation process in some forms [ 25 ] , and idea creators such as fashion designers have been using social media frequently in recent years to encounter new inspiration [ 26 ] , [ 27 ] . So far , the primary use of social media in the industry has been to look up related words or feedback for a speciﬁc prod - uct as marketing research [ 28 ] , and there has been little study on the mechanism of how social media users generate ideas . As the close studies , Carr et al . searched for the related words of a product from social media , analyzed their volume , and conﬁrmed the insights obtained the result aligned with existing research methods [ 29 ] . Han et al . held a design challenge in which designers were asked to design a chair based on the chair’s related words and feelings obtained through social media searches and found that social media information is helpful for designers [ 12 ] . Ozcan et al . tried to make a model to classify whether a post on social media contains ideas or not [ 30 ] . Our study advances this line of research and is the ﬁrst empirical analysis of an ideation contest on social media . Other papers examined hashtags and their evolution on social media with respect to what words are used for certain events . Cunha et al . characterized what hashtags are used in real - world events and showed the structure of extreme usage of some hashtags [ 31 ] . Sato et al . visualized how hashtags evolve over time in a network with edit distance between hashtags as edges , and showed that hashtags are evolving from seeded hashtags in various directions over time [ 32 ] . On the other hand , these studies differ from ours in that they analyzed various hashtags describing a speciﬁc event together , which included their impressions of the event , and not for the purpose of ideation for naming purposes . Furthermore , these papers focus solely on hashtags , and our study further analyzes the posters of ideas and their interaction . C . Collective Creativity and Diversity of Ideas Idea generation is an essential component of the production process and one of the highest leverage points for a com - pany [ 33 ] . For an efﬁcient idea generation , the exchange of ideas by many individuals is considered effective [ 34 ] because it stimulates further associations and ideas [ 35 ] and provides exposure to more ideas than generating ideas alone [ 36 ] . This kind of approach to creative activity is called collective creativity [ 37 ] . Collective creativity is sometimes criticized as being inef - fective for idea generation . For example , some studies show that brainstorming does not efﬁciently aid in the generation of ideas [ 38 ] . However , the underlying argument is that the evaluation of submitted ideas on the spot prevents the submission of the next idea [ 39 ] , and it has been reported that this drawback can be overcome by , for example , exchanging ideas in a text - based manner instead of gathering ideas in - person [ 40 ] . Furthermore , unlike brainstorming , social media has the potential to extract more diverse ideas because it is an environment for casual idea generation , where submitted ideas do not necessarily get feedback from others . In collective creativity , the key to sound idea generation is the diversity of participants and ideas [ 41 ] . Innovation is said to come from the combination of knowledge from different ﬁelds [ 42 ] , [ 43 ] ; thus , the stimulus supplied to the participants in the exchange of ideas would increase with the diversity of the participants and the ideas , which results in the generation of more fresh ideas . It was shown in laboratory experiments [ 43 ] that mediating distant people ( i . e . , weak connections ) in a social network can facilitate the generation of new ideas . Considering that social media has a higher contingency for far - distant people on social networks than in the physical world and that it is easier to mediate distant users , social media is a promising place for generating new ideas . Despite the potential of social media to extract diverse ideas , there is still a lack of understanding about how to extract them efﬁciently . By analyzing ideation behaviors in social media , this study conﬁrms the potential for utilizing them for organizational open - innovation and explores how to utilize them . III . D ATA C OLLECTION A . Finding Candidate Acronyms We ﬁrst collect tweets to identify candidate acronyms . We use the Twitter Academic API [ 44 ] to obtain tweets containing “FANG” or “FAANG” , which have been common names for Big Tech [ 13 ] , from 28 Oct 2021 to 30 Nov 2021 , one month window after Facebook’s name change . The API is case - insensitive in search . As a result , we obtained 53 , 975 English tweets without retweets ( RTs ) . Then , after making all text lowercase , we extracted the 150 most co - occurred words with “fang” or “faang” based on the Jaccard coefﬁcient [ 45 ] , and conducted a manual examination to extract a set of candidate acronyms of the new Big Tech companies . As a result , we obtained 21 candidate ideas ( shown in Table I ) . Note that we omitted the candidates with a single tweet , which are MAMSANG , TMAANG , MAANAT , MANATAM , and MATANTA , from Table I . B . Collecting Tweets with Candidate Acronyms We use the Twitter API again to search for tweets containing those 21 candidates over the same period . As a result , we TABLE I T HE CANDIDATE IDEAS AND THEIR STATISTICS .

How - ever , we found that many of the candidates had homonyms ( e . g . , MAMA for a music award [ 46 ] , MAGA for a political slogan [ 47 ] ) . Therefore , to extract relevant tweets for this study , we focus on the tweets that match either of the following two conditions : • Condition 1 : Tweets that contain ( FANG , FAANG , or Meta ) AND ( any one or more of the candidate words ) ; • Condition 2 : Tweets that contain ( any one or more of the candidate words ) AND ( all the company names in the corresponding candidate word ) . An example of condition 2 is a tweet containing ‘MANG , ’ AND ‘Meta , ’ ‘Apple , ’ ‘Netﬂix , ’ and ‘Google . ’ As some com - panies could represent the same acronym ( e . g . , ‘Amazon’ and ‘Apple’ could be used for ‘A’ in an acronym ) , we used all the combinations of companies for searching the corresponding tweets using the possible company names listed in § 3 . 3 . We consider both lowercase and uppercase for search . Then , we checked all the tweets manually and excluded 74 tweets that had nothing to do with the context of Big Tech , which were mainly composed of unremoved MAMA tweets [ 46 ] and hashtag hijacking [ 48 ] . As a result , we retrieved 2 , 219 tweets ( Idea tweets ) excluding RTs , of which 1 , 766 were regular tweets that were neither replies nor quote retweets ( QTs ) . A drastic decrease in the number of tweets is mainly due to the massive amount of tweets related to “MAMA , ” 1 . 6 million tweets in the original dataset . Our ﬁltering criteria were found to be effective in removing irrelevant tweets ; even among the tweets containing MAANG , we ﬁltered out 38 . 8 % of tweets that are unrelated to Big Tech ( e . g . , MAANG seems to be a casual word used often in Indonesian users ) . We then collected how other users engaged with these Idea tweets : 3 , 735 replies , 850 QTs , and 1 , 622 RTs . We also collected the followers of ( 1 ) the authors of Idea tweets and ( 2 ) those who share ( by RT or QT ) the Idea tweets . The number of users is 3 , 912 . Out of the number of followers of each user , the max is approx . 24 . 2 mil . , the minimum is 1 , the mean is 18 , 117 . 0 , and the median is 366 . 5 . IV . A F IRST L OOK AT THE S PONTANEOUS I DEATION C ONTEST A . A List of Ideas and User Engagement Statistics The ideas ( i . e . , candidate acronyms ) , the frequency of tweets containing them , and various engagement metrics are shown in Table I , which include the number of posts containing them ( Tweet ) , retweet ( RT ) , like , reply , quote retweets ( QT ) , unique users ( UU ) , and the follower counts of the authors of Tweet ( Follower ) . The metrics except for Tweet and UU indicate the average values per tweet . All the candidates are acronyms of A ( Apple , Amazon , or Alphabet ) , G ( Google ) , M ( Microsoft or Meta ) , N ( Netﬂix ) , S ( Salesforce ) , and T ( Tesla or Twitter ) . Interestingly , compared to the original FAANG companies , several companies are newly included in candidate acronyms , which might reﬂect the dynamics of the IT industry . In terms of the number of tweets , MAANG and MANGA are the two most popular ideas . MAANG is a simple replace - ment of F ( Facebook ) with M ( Meta ) in FAANG . MANGA is one of the famous Japanese words that refer to Japanese comics [ 49 ] . We suppose that the popularity of MANGA is due to the serendipitous match with the well - known term . MANG , which is also a direct replacement for FANG , is the third most popular idea , presumably because FAANG has been more widely used than FANG since 2017 [ 50 ] . In fact , FANG ( 141 tweets ) was much less common than FAANG ( 1 , 766 tweets ) . For other engagement metrics , different ideas are more popular than MAANG and MANGA : MAMA , MAGA , and MAMATA for RTs and likes—more users are engaged by clicks ; MAGMA , MAGA , and MAMATA for the reply and QT—more user are engaged by leaving a tweet with their own text ; MAMATA and AMAMA for the average number of followers—more inﬂuencers are engaged . The number of Idea tweets and their unique users is almost the same , indicating that each user tweeted an idea once . We note that 150 ( 8 . 77 % ) out of the 2 , 219 Idea tweets contained multiple ideas , with the number of simultaneous ideas where the max is 7 , the minimum is 2 , the mean is 2 . 12 , and the median is 2 . MAANG and MANGA appeared simultaneously in the most Idea tweets ( 60 times ) , while the combination of MAANA and MANG had the highest Jaccard coefﬁcient ( 0 . 09 ) . B . Time Series of the Ideation Contest To investigate how the ideation contest rises and converges , we examine the time series of the idea tweets . Figure 2 presents the hourly volume of tweets with the top 5 ideas and the hourly volume of RTs of those tweets . The period is one week , starting from the day before Facebook changes its name to Meta . We can see that all the ideas emerge at almost the same time , which is right after the announcement of Facebook’s name change . When looking into the dynamics on a ﬁner scale , we found that the tweet of a news account that ﬁrst reported about Facebook’s name change was written at 6 : 07 PM on October 29 , 2021 ( UTC + 0 ) [ 51 ] as far as we could conﬁrm . The ideation contest started around 16 minutes after the name change announcement . The number of ideas gradually increased after the announce - ment , with convergence and excitement repeating several times . By October 31 , three days after the announcement , the contest is almost over . When looking at the volume of tweets for each candidate over time , it is hard to judge which one is dominant between MAANG and MANGA at the start , and the gap is gradually opening up . Also , in terms of RTs , MANGA is overwhelmingly large initially , but in line with MANGA’s gradual dominance in the number of tweets , MANGA has been overtaken by MAANG in hourly RTs at the third peak . 27 01 Nov 2021 28 29 30 31 02 0 20 40 60 80 C oun t p e r h ou r MAANG MANGA MANG MAMAA MAANA ( a ) Tweet 27 01 Nov2021 28 29 30 31 02 0 50 100 150 C oun t p e r h ou r MAANG MANGA MANG MAMAA MAANA ( b ) Retweet Fig . 2 . Hourly frequency of tweets and retweets of top ﬁve ideas . V . D IVERSITY OF IDEAS ON SOCIAL MEDIA A . Comparison with Mainstream Media As we are especially interested in how diverse ideas are proposed on social media , an analysis of the ideas mentioned in mainstream media and media - related accounts can provide a good reference . To this aim , we divide the users who post Idea tweets into media - related accounts and the rest . For this purpose , we extracted 159 users whose account names and bio information include the words “media , ” “news , ” “reporter , ” “journalist” among 2 , 081 users we collected . Then , we manually remove accounts that are not related to the media from them . In addition , to mark prominent media , e . g . , CNBC and Reuters , we use Twitter’s “veriﬁed” information associated with the account [ 52 ] . As a result , we obtained 93 media - related ( of which veriﬁed : 17 ) and 1 , 988 non - media - related users ( of which veriﬁed : 62 ) . The distribution of the ideas they mention is shown in Figure 3 and 4 . These ﬁgures show the counts of Idea tweets aggregated by each idea and converted into percentages ; here , the top ﬁve ideas and the aggregation of other ideas ( Others ) are presented . Comparing media - related accounts with the rest ( Figure 3 ) , we ﬁnd that media - related accounts are more heavily biased toward MAANG , while there is a much less ratio for Others , meaning a biased distribution of ideas . The χ 2 tests showed a signiﬁcant difference in the distribution of ideas between media - related and non - media - related accounts ( p < 0 . 001 ) . Note that we conduct the χ 2 tests on count - based aggregation , not on ratios [ 53 ] , and the same for the later analyses . Furthermore , in Figure 4 , we see that both veriﬁed and non - veriﬁed media - related accounts exhibit skewed distributions of ideas ( in both cases , the higher ratio for MAANG and the lower ratio for Others ) . This suggests that a diversity of ideas are more likely to surface on social media than in the mainstream media , regardless of their prominence .

The numbers ( aligned with colors ) indicate the percentage of ideas posted by each group of users ( the sum of row numbers is 100 ) . B . Comparison with Inﬂuencers We also show the heatmap for ( non - ) veriﬁed accounts in Figure 5 . Interestingly , there is no signiﬁcant difference between the two groups ( p = 0 . 33 by the χ 2 test ) . Rather , the distribution of ideas seems ﬂatter for veriﬁed accounts ( the Gini coefﬁcients : 0 . 332 for the veriﬁed group and 0 . 425 for the non - veriﬁed group ) . Intuitively , it seems that users with less presence ( less inﬂuential ) may enjoy more freedom to propose diverse ideas . To validate this intuition quantitatively , we analyze the relationship between the number of followers of accounts and the diversity of ideas in this subsection . First , we divided the users into four quadrants based on the number of followers ; the ﬁrst quartile is 73 , the median is 303 , and the third quartile is 1 , 322 . As the number of followers in the third quartile , 1 , 322 , is relatively small to be called an inﬂuencer in the Twitterverse , we further divide the users by the number of followers by 10k ( 151 users ) in reference to the discussion in [ 54 ] . Figure 6 and 7 show the heatmaps by the number of followers . Interestingly , in Figure 6 , as the number of followers increases , the proportion of MAANG decreases and the proportion of Others increases . In other words , the larger number of followers the users have , the more diverse their ideas are . This result is somewhat unexpected because M AA N G M A N G A M A N G M A M AA M AA N A O t h e r s Verified nonVerified 36 21 5 . 1 9 . 1 11 17 38 33 5 . 7 5 . 4 4 . 6 14 10 20 30 Fig . 5 . Relationship between ( non - ) veriﬁed accounts and ideas . The numbers ( aligned with colors ) indicate the percentage of ideas posted by each group of users ( the sum of row numbers is 100 ) . it was expected from past studies that users are less likely to propose ideas when they are evaluated by others [ 39 ] . We assume they have a large number of followers because they usually post interesting ideas . On the other hand , Figure 7 shows that users in the range from the third quartile ( 1 , 322 ) to 10k , or middle inﬂuencers , generate the most diverse ideas , rather than users with more than 10k followers ( although p = 0 . 10 for the χ 2 test of ‘1 , 332 – 10k’ between ‘ > = 10k’ ) . Thus , there is the possibility that the aforementioned study [ 39 ] is only applicable to the users with more than 10k followers : when users have a high probability of getting feedback on their ideas , it is more difﬁcult to propose unique ideas because of their publicity .

N ETWORK AND P ROFILES OF P ARTICIPANTS A . User Groups and Preferences of Ideas Now we move on to who proposes and spreads the ideas . Existing research suggests that there is a relationship between “distance of participants” and diversity of ideas , with more dis - tant people having different ideas [ 43 ] . On social media , which is a virtual environment , distance is often measured from a social network constructed by the users’ relationships [ 56 ] . In this section , we study the relationship between the distance of users on social media and their idea preferences . To this aim , we collect and reconstruct the following network of users who propose and spread ideas . We found that most accounts were connected , with the ratio of its largest connected component as 79 . 7 % of all users . On the other hand , the other connected components consisted of less than three users . To examine different groups joining in the idea contest , we identiﬁed clusters of the largest connected component by using Louvain clustering [ 55 ] ( with the “resolution” parameter as 1 ) , resulting in the ﬁve largest clusters in the network . Figure 8 visualizes the network colored by different clusters with their representative words . The shape of the network is formed by the ForceAtlas2 algorithm [ 57 ] . We determined the representative words for each cluster by extracting the words with the highest TF - IDF scores in the users’ bio information of each cluster . When calculating TF - IDF scores , we aggregated the texts in user bios into one document for each cluster ( i . e . , we made ﬁve documents for the calculation ) . By manually looking at the representative words , we labeled each cluster as Business , Engineer ( web ) , Engineer ( other ) , Entrepreneur , and Tech news . Each cluster accounts for 28 . 4 % , 19 . 2 % , 22 . 2 % , 15 . 9 % , and 4 . 8 % of the largest connected component , respectively . Seemingly , the clusters are largely composed of tech and business - related accounts . Their high engagement in the ideation contest makes sense because 1 ) Big Tech companies are deeply related to engineers in terms of their products and careers , and 2 ) since these companies are signiﬁcant investment targets , they drew interest from business and investment accounts . We note that we manually examined that the Business cluster has many individuals ( not news organizations ) who had the word “news” in their bio , but the Tech news cluster has many news organizations . Then , how do these clusters relate to the ideas ? Figure 9 is a heatmap showing the ratios of ideas for the above - mentioned top 5 groups and the aggregation of users in the rest of the groups ( Others ) . The pair - wise χ 2 tests showed a signiﬁcant difference in the distribution of ideas in all pairs ( all p < 0 . 001 ) except for the pair of ‘Engineer ( other ) ’ and ‘Others’ ( p = 0 . 49 ) and the pair of ‘Entrepreneur’ and ‘Others’ ( p = 0 . 57 ) . In other words , this result provides evidence that distant users on social media prefer different ideas , which aligns with the previous research [ 56 ] . This result can also come from the factor that people with different jobs prefer different ideas . Given that people with similar attributes tend to cluster close on social networks [ 58 ] , it is natural to assume a relationship between these occupations and distance . Also , note that the present analysis does not determine which affects the diversity of ideas more , distance M AA N G M A N G A M A N G M A M AA M AA N A O t h e r s Engineer ( web ) Business Tech news Entrepreneur Others Engineer ( other ) U s e r l a b e l s 54 32 2 . 1 1 . 6 2 . 1 8 41 21 8 8 . 4 3 . 6 18 39 15 9 13 11 12 28 40 2 . 9 3 . 3 7 . 5 18 22 45 4 . 6 4 . 6 4 . 6 19 19 53 3 . 2 6 . 1 6 . 1 13 20 40 P e r c e n t a g e Fig . 9 . Relationship between user clusters and ideas . The numbers ( aligned with colors ) indicate the percentage of ideas posted by each group of users ( the sum of row numbers is 100 ) . The rows are sorted by the percentage for MAANG . or attributes . Nor does the result indicate a causal relationship : the result does not indicate that distancing users or changing attributes of users will necessarily result in a change in their preferred ideas . However , it is possible that distance leads to a preference for different ideas , even if the attributes are similar . This is because the present network shows that the engineers in different locations signiﬁcantly differed in the preferred ideas ( MAANG and MANGA ) , although their type of engineers is different . Nonetheless , we leave such a comparison of dis - tances and attributes and the causal analysis to future research . B . Who initiates the ideation contest ? When using social media for idea generation in practice , it is important to know who to track . Therefore , understanding the roles and attributes of those who create and spread ideas could help extract ideas from social media more efﬁciently . To distinguish those who initiate the ideas , we utilize the following network and examine whether the authors of Idea tweets had seen other Idea tweets before they posted theirs . Although Twitter API does not provide whether or not a user actually ‘sees’ a certain tweet , we approximate it based on the posted time of the Idea tweet . In other words , we assume that a user saw an Idea tweet if any of the followee had posted or shared an Idea tweet before a user’s Idea tweet . Then , we label the authors of Idea tweets as Primary if they have not seen any idea tweets beforehand , and Secondary if their followees have already tweeted or shared the ideas . Among the 2 , 081 unique authors of Idea tweets ( i . e . , Primary and Secondary ) , the number of Primary users was 974 ( 46 . 8 % ) , almost half of the authors . Also , we label the users who just shared ideas without adding new ideas as Spreader ( 1 , 831 users ) . When we look at the follower counts , the median follower counts of Primary , Secondary , and Spreader were 164 , 540 , and 446 , respectively ( shown in Figure 10 ) . Secondary has the largest number of followers on average , followed by Spreader and Primary , and the differences are all signiﬁcant ( p < 0 . 0001 with Mann - Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction ) . In other words , it can be seen that the ideas of Primary with fewer followers are picked up by Secondary and Spreader with more followers . As for Spreader , it has been said that widely spread information is associated with inﬂuencers with a large number of followers [ 59 ] . On the other hand , in the comparison between Primary and Secondary , it is interesting to see the former has fewer followers , indicating the difﬁculty in tracking the users who tend to initiate ideation contests . Note that the mean ( max ) follower counts of Primary , Secondary , and Spreader were 5 , 652 ( 1 . 9 mil . ) , 53 , 609 . 4 ( 24 . 2 mil . ) , and 3288 . 8 ( 0 . 8 mil . ) , respectively . Fig . 10 . Boxplot of follower counts for accounts of Primary , Secondary , and Spreader . The stars indicate the signiﬁcant differences with Mann - Whitney test with Bonferroni correction ( * * * * : p < 0 . 0001 ) . Figure 11 also shows the number of followees of these three groups . The median followee counts of Primary , Secondary , and Spreader were 210 , 643 , and 602 , respectively Only the Primary group has a signiﬁcantly lower number of followees , indicating that they tend to lead in proposing original ideas with fewer information sources or that they tend to ‘come up with’ ideas by themselves . Note that the mean ( max ) followee counts of Primary , Secondary , and Spreader were 406 . 3 ( 9 , 979 ) , 1 , 370 . 8 ( 47 , 445 ) , and 1414 . 4 ( 105 , 504 ) , respectively . Fig . 11 .

I DEA E XCHANGES AMONG THE P ARTICIPANTS Ideation contests on social media can be the place of ‘idea exchanges’ through discussions . In particular , we examine how interactions between users on social media lead to a diversity of ideas . On social media , users can see each other’s tweets and can exchange ideas by sending replies to others . It is said that participant interaction in idea generation promotes diversity of ideas [ 34 ] , and we examine whether this phenomenon can be observed in social media interactions . Here , we analyze how ideas are exchanged and how discus - sions help to generate ideas on social media by constructing reply trees . To do so , we collect all the replies to the 1 , 766 regular tweets by using the conversation id in the Twitter API , as noted in Section § 3 . 1 . As a result , we obtained 2 , 096 replies . The number of regular tweets that received replies is 403 ( 22 . 8 % ) out of 1 , 766 . The number of direct replies to the regu - lar tweets varies , ranging from 1 at the minimum and median , 3 . 93 at the mean , to 64 at the maximum , indicating that some regular tweets received an extremely large number of replies . Then , we connect the collected replies to form reply trees . Starting from the 403 regular tweets that received replies , treat - ing a connected chain to the end of replies as one pattern , we form a total of 1 , 585 patterns of reply trees , including branches from the same crotch . The maximum length of a reply tree was 10 , the minimum 2 , the mean 2 . 40 , and the median 2 . We ﬁrst investigate how new ideas are introduced in those reply trees . We trace the reply tree from the root and count how many unique ideas existed in each reply in the tree . As a result , among the 1 , 585 reply trees , we found that 360 trees accumulate new ideas at some point in replies . Of these , new ideas are added in the ﬁrst reply in 327 ( 90 . 8 % ) trees . At the maximum , a new idea was added at a reply depth of 4 for the ﬁrst time . Figure 12 summarizes the relationship between the depth of replies and the number of ideas . 0 1 2 3 4 Reply depth 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 C u m u l a t i v e c oun t o f un i q u e i d e a s Fig . 12 . The relationship between the depth of reply trees and cumulative count of unique ideas in the tree . Size of points indicates the number of tweets which are lastly added new ideas at a depth of reply ( x - axis ) and the number of ideas ( y - axis ) . The line indicates the pattern of accumulation of ideas through reply trees , and its width indicates the number of each pattern of reply trees . Next , we analyze whether there is an association between the replies and the diversity of ideas . To this aim , we tabulated the types of ideas within each chain pattern . The types of reply trees here were Idea tweets that received no replies ( No reply all ) , Idea tweets that received replies and all of their replies ( With reply all ) , only Idea tweets that received replies ( With reply root ) , and only the replies to the Idea tweets ( With reply branch ) . For each , we aggregated the ideas within each group of tweets and created a heatmap of the proportions ( Figure 13 ) . The pair - wise χ 2 tests for all these tweet groups all showed signiﬁcant differences ( p < 0 . 001 ) . Concerning the presence of replies ( No reply all v . s . With reply all ) , the distribution of With reply all is ﬂatter , and its ratio for Others is larger than No reply all . In other words , a greater variety of ideas was generated when there were replies . Furthermore , when we look in - depth at With reply all , we ﬁnd that MAANG is dominated in the ﬁrst tweet ( With reply root ) , while MANGA is dominated in its replies ( With reply branch ) , and its ratio of Others is also larger . In other words , it is conceivable that unordinary ideas are added to the original tweets via replies .

Relationship between type of reply trees and ideas . The numbers ( aligned with colors ) indicate the percentage of ideas posted by each group of users ( the sum of row numbers is 100 ) . Since the diversity of ideas seems to be associated with the interaction of users , it would be helpful to know in which con - ditions the interaction tends to occur to ﬁnd them efﬁciently or spark them deliberately . Thus , we performed a logistic multiple regression analysis to determine which idea tweets were more likely to receive a reply . Here , we constructed a classiﬁcation model based on whether or not a reply was re - ceived at least once ( 1 if received , 0 otherwise ) . We considered the following features : Engineer : whether the author is an engineer or not . In this case , we used the binary of whether the author belongs to the two clusters of engineers introduced in Section § 6 . Follower count : we used the average number of followers of the author . Bio length : how long it describes itself or how anonymous it is . Veriﬁed : whether or not they have public recognition on Twitter [ 52 ] . Time : how long ( in sec - onds ) it has been since Facebook changed its name . Negative and positive : How negative or positive the text is . We used the roBERTa - based pre - trained model [ 60 ] . This model outputs three classes , including neutral , but neutral was excluded from the regression model . Idea count : how many ideas an Idea tweet contains . Ideas : whether a tweet includes the top 5 ideas . Table II shows the results of the logistic regression ( number of fake tweets is N = 1 , 766 ) . The p - values are computed using two - tailed z - tests . All variance inﬂation factors ( VIFs ) [ 61 ] are less than three , indicating that multicollinearity is negligible . Pseudo R 2 value is 0 . 21 . We conduct log transform to some features when needed , indicated as ( log ) in Table II . The results show that engineers with more followers and more bio length are more likely to receive replies . We also found that the faster one posts an Idea tweet , the more likely it gets replies . Interestingly , negative tweets ( e . g . , “MAANG sounds a lot less cool than FAANG” ) are more likely to receive replies , presumably because negative emotion tends to provoke discussions than positive tweets . VIII . D ISCUSSION AND C ONCLUSION In this study , we used Facebook’s name change event as a case study to characterize ideation behavior on social media . We extracted a comprehensive set of acronyms to refer to new Big Tech companies and analyzed their dynamics TABLE II R ESULTS OF THE REGRESSION ANALYSIS PREDICTING WHETHER OR NOT AN I DEA TWEET GETS AT LEAST ONE REPLY .

The main conclusions are as follows : 1 ) more diverse ideas are appeared on social media than on mainstream media , 2 ) the user’s topological position on a social network is important for the preference of ideas , and 3 ) social interactions can spark diversity of ideas . We also characterize the popularity ( e . g . , shares and likes ) of each idea , those who take different roles in generating ideas , and conditions that idea tweets would attract more replies . Our study conﬁrms the potential of social media for idea generation and provides a guideline on how to spark diverse ideas . A . Limitation and Future Works There are some limitations in our work . First , we could not track the ideas of private accounts or deleted accounts . How - ever , given that the new name of Tech companies is not about a sensitive issue , we believe that their effect would be marginal . Second , as we examined the single case of the idea contest , more studies are required for the generality of our ﬁndings . Third , while we examined idea generation behavior on social media , we did not investigate the quality of ideas . As [ 62 ] has already pointed out , the ideas gathered by ideation contests are a mixed bag and methods for extracting good ideas from them are in demand . Fourth , our analysis of the relationship between replies and diversity of ideas does not directly examine causal - ity . Future research could study causal inferences from obser - vational data and ﬁeld studies involving interventions [ 63 ] . We also note that we loosely deﬁne an ideation contest as a situation in which many people are exchanging ideas . In particular , we did not decide on the winner based on the ideas submitted . By contrast , in practice , companies may rank the ideas based on the number of RTs or likes , which would eventually become a form of contest . Also , we have used social media data to characterize and evaluate ideas during the ideation contest , but their impact has not been studied . For example , MAANG and MANGA , which were the most proposed , did not necessarily replace the original FAANG . Nonetheless , we believe this study presents meaningful results in terms of characterizing the idea generation mechanism and the competition between new ideas . As for the methods for discovering Idea words , a more sophisticated one would be useful for future research . In this study , we decided to set a strict search query that considers the context of the Big Tech name change . Furthermore , we do not distinguish between suggesting and mentioning an idea . We considered tweeting using the new Big Tech name to be in itself the same as suggesting it . However , this can only be valid for this case study . For other events , there may be a need to extract tweets that are proposing ideas only [ 30 ] . As for the volume of data , this study’s ideation competition had about 2 , 000 participants , which is a relatively small size of data compared to common Twitter studies using ‘Big’ data . This is the result of strict ﬁltering schemes applied to our initial 3 . 55 million tweets containing candidate terms , and we got excellent precision ( 97 % : 74 / ( 2219 + 74 ) ) from detected idea tweets . Nonetheless , considering that it is difﬁcult and expensive to recruit 2 , 000 people via a corporate platform or crowdsourcing , this study exhibited the usefulness of social media in recruiting such a large number of participants .
