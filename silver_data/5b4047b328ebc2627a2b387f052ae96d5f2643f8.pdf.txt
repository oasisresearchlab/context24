Brownell a Cancer cells become mobile by remodelling their cytoskeleton to form migratory structures . This transformation is dominated by actin assembly and disassembly ( polymerisation and depolymerisation ) in the cytoplasm . Synthesis of filamentous actin produces a force at the leading edge that pushes the plasma membrane forward . We describe an assay to measure the restoring force of the membrane in response to forces generated within the cytoplasm adjacent to the membrane . A laser trap is used to form a long membrane nanotube from a living cell and to measure the axial membrane force at the end of the tube . When the tube , resembling a filopodium , is formed and in a relaxed state the axial membrane force exhibits a positive stationary value . This value reflects the influence of the cytoskeleton that acts to pull the tube back to the cell . A dynamic sawtooth force that rides upon the stationary value is also observed . This force is sensitive to a toxin that aﬀects actin assembly and disassembly , but not aﬀected by agents that influence microtubules and myosin light chain kinase . We deduce from the magnitude and characteristics of dynamic force measurements that it originates from depolymerisation and polymerisation of F - actin . The on - and oﬀ - rates , the number of working filaments , and the force per filament ( 2 . 5 pN ) are determined . We suggest the force - dependent transitions are thermodynamically uncoupled as both the on - and oﬀ - rates decrease exponentially with a compressive load . We propose kinetic schemes that require attachment of actin filaments to the membrane during depolymerisation . This demonstrates that actin kinetics can be monitored in a living cell by measuring force at the membrane , and used to probe the mobility of cells including cancer cells . Insight , innovation , integration The magnitude and time course of the pushing force resulting from actin polymerisation is measured in a cell by monitoring the restoring force of the plasma membrane at the end of a nanotube that resembles a filopodium . An oppositely directed pulling force associated with depolymerisation is also detected at the membrane suggesting the filaments in the tube are not always treadmilling . The reaction exhibits elaborate kinetics in cells compared to isolated filaments as the pathway for assembly is diﬀerent from disassembly under a compressive load . Introduction Actin remodeling is a characteristic of cell motility , 1 and occurs during the invasive stage of carcinoma when transformed epithelial cells produce migratory structures 2 ( e . g . filopodia 3 ) . Migration from the primary site of the tumour into the sur - rounding stroma requires cancer cells to produce conduits either chemically ( e . g . , enzymatic degradation of the basement membrane ) or biophysically through generation of force . 4 The force produced by a cancer cell within its surrounding environ - ment is the resultant of three components : adhesive traction , protrusive and resistive viscous drag . 5 Recent experimental evidence shows the magnitude of the adhesive force integrated over the area of the cell ( nN ) increases with the metastatic potential of cells within two - dimensional 6 and 3 - dimensional 7 migration space . The adhesive force was measured with traction force microscopy 8 which monitors the imprint left on a substrate ( or matrix ) by contractile stresses of the cell propelling itself within the matrix . 9 We describe a force assay to measure the a Bobby R Alford Department of Otolaryngology – Head & Neck Surgery , Baylor College of Medicine , Houston , TX 77030 , USA .

We describe this methodology with results from a hematopoietic cell . Theory F - actin is a globular protein that polymerizes into a linear , two - stranded double helix . The length of each monomer is B 5 . 4 nm where the addition of one monomer increases the overall length of the polymer by B 2 . 7 nm . 10 Actin is a chemical motor ; the free energy available during polymerisation and depolymerisation of actin can be used to do work . 11 , 12 Mechanical work , i . e . , force (cid:2) length , arises because of the diﬀerence in the chemical potential of the monomer in the biopolymer ( F - actin ) versus that in solution . 11 The direction of the ( mechanical ) force depends upon the concentration of monomer , c , relative to a critical concen - tration , c o ( also referred to as the dissociation constant for the polymerisation reaction , c o (cid:3) k oﬀ / k on where k oﬀ and k on are oﬀ and on - rate constants ) . The expression for the force , f is f ¼ (cid:4) k B T l ln c c o (cid:2) (cid:3) ð 1 Þ where l : is the length constant ; k B is Boltzmann’s constant ; and T is temperature . In cells , the fast growing barbed end of the filament points towards the plasma membrane . For an F - actin bundle enclosed by a membrane tube as found in filopodium the membrane axial force , F will act to restore the polymerisation force 13 and the depolymerisation force will act in the same direction as F , then for a change in the membrane axial force , D F we write D F = (cid:4) f , { c > c o } D F = f , { c o c o } D F = 0 , { c (cid:3) c o } . ( 2 ) Evidence that actin polymerisation produces a protrusive force arose from experiments with model systems , including giant liposomes where actin polymerisation changed the shape of the membrane and the vesicles moved with velocities similar to that observed in cells . 14 Other experiments show that bacteria ( e . g . , Listeria mono - cytogenes ) , can propel through their host driven by poly - merisation . 15 – 17 Force measurements found that B 1 pN of force stalls isolated growing filaments . 18 , 19 More recent measurements estimate the force per filament at 5 – 11 pN when actin filaments are allowed to polymerize between two mica surfaces . 20 One measure - ment of force produced by actin polymerisation in living cells estimates the force per filopodium at 3 pN . 21 There are no estimates of the pulling force as a result of depolymerisation of actin . Eqn ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) predict that depolymerisation of F - actin if attached to the membrane 11 , 12 could pull the membrane axially whereas polymerisation of monomeric actin would push the membrane ( Fig . 1a ) . The expressions suggest the magnitude of the actin - based force can be obtained upon measuring D F . The impediment is to develop an assay to demonstrate that the plasma membrane can monitor actin kinetics within a living cell . Recently Pontes and colleagues 22 show that F - actin filled membrane tubes ( B 10 – 15 m m in length ) form from cultured fibroblasts by use of laser tweezers , where an optically trapped bead is used as a handle to manipulate the membrane of cells . 23 , 24 They use confocal microscopy to reveal F - actin has grown within the membrane tubes . 22 This observation is in agreement with earlier studies with neutrophils where it was suggested that F - actin may form in the tube 25 and a second study which shows that F - actin can grow to form arrays within the tube . 26 Specifically , polymerisation of actin was observed within the lumen of tubes formed from neutrophils . This polymerisation occurred up to lengths of 10 – 20 m m and at a rate of 0 . 07 m m s (cid:4) 1 upon applying a significant local stress ( > 600 Pa ) to the cell . This force was suggested to originate from cell contraction . 26 We form membrane tubes ( 15 – 40 m m in length ) from a living cell with laser tweezers . We also suggest that F - actin grows within the tubes . This is deduced from the characteristics of the axial membrane force when it relaxes to a stationary value . It is during this phase that we observe a dynamic sawtooth force riding upon the stationary value . This dynamic force has a diﬀerent magnitude and time course to that observed for cell contraction 26 and we reason that it originates from actin polymerisation and depolymer - isation ( Fig . 1 ) . By monitoring the change in magnitude of the stationary - axial membrane force ( D F ) with laser tweezers and the time course of D F we uncover the magnitude of f and character - istics of the rates under a compressive load .

The drugs were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) . The drugs were added 15 minutes before the onset of the experiment . Cells Mast cells were isolated from peritoneum of normal mice ( strain C57BL ) by peritoneal lavage with CO 2 independent medium with 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) dissolved ( Invi - trogen , CA ) . The suspension was centrifuged at 100 (cid:2) g for 15 minutes and the pellet dissolved in CO 2 independent medium without BSA . The cell supernatant was plated on Petri - dishes rinsed with saline solution and visualized on an inverted microscope with bright - field optics at 22 1 C . The data reported were obtained from 32 animals . These included : 23 / 32 ( control ) , 17 / 32 ( cytochalasin E ) , 4 / 32 ( nocodazole ) , 3 / 32 ( ML - 7 ) and 5 / 32 ( DMSO ) animals . The sawtooth data presented were obtained from 11 animals ( 22 cells ) ; specifically from 8 / 11 ( control ) , 1 / 11 ( nocodazole ) , 2 / 11 ( ML - 7 ) and 3 / 11 ( DMSO ) animals . Baylor College of Medicine Animal Care and Use Committee approved the care and use of the animals . Sawtooths were detected about 1 / 3 of the time for tubes r 25 m m according to the protocol ( see Analysis of the force ) . Beads Sulphate - coated polystyrene microspheres ( radius : 2 m m Fluospheres sulfate , F8858 , Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) were used as handles to form the tubes . They were utilized according to the instructions of the manufacture . No additional surface treatments were made . Laser tweezers The trap was formed with a continuous wave titanium - sapphire laser tuned to 830 nm ( Newport Corporation , Spectra - Physics , Model 3900S , Irvine , CA ) and pumped by a 5 W solid state frequency doubled Nd : YVO 4 laser ( Newport Corporation , Spectra - Physics , Model 3900S , Irvine , CA ) . 27 Images of the cells and trapped beads were projected on a monitor and recorded by a S - VHS recorder . Before each experiment , the trap was calibrated perpendicular to the focal direction . 27 The calibra - tion ranged from 0 . 6 – 1 . 5 pN mV (cid:4) 1 . The power at the objective was between 100 – 200 mW . The trap stiﬀness was 0 . 1 – 0 . 2 pN nm (cid:4) 1 and was linear for displacements approaching the radius ( 2 m m ) of the polystyrene microspheres . Data from the quadrant photo diode , QPD was amplified by a circuit and digitized with an A / D converter ( Iotech , Wavebook512 , Cleveland , OH ) and collected at a sampling rate of 1 kHz . Calibration of the laser - trap ; movement of the piezoelectric stage , PZT ( Physik Instrumente , Model P - 527 . C3L , Waldbronn , Germany ) and data collection were controlled by algorithms written in LabView , v7 ( National Instru - ments , Austin TX ) . Because the image of the bead monitored by the QPD is aﬀected by objects close to the bead ( o 10 m m ) , only measurements made when the cell was > 15 m m from the centre of the bead are reported . Incidental movement of cell debris close to the trapped bead during an experiment was monitored with the SVHS video and when observed these measurements were discarded . Force was calculated from the product of the position data sensed by QPD ( mV ) and the calibration ( pN mV (cid:4) 1 ) constant . Formation of membrane tubes Experiments were conducted at room temperature at 22 1 C . Cells that adhered to glass and exhibited bright luminescent secretory granules were chosen for tube extraction . A bead was trapped , and a cell was brought towards the trapped bead with PZT at a velocity of 1 m m s (cid:4) 1 . The cell and bead were held in contact for 5 to 15 s to promote adhesion . The cell was then moved away from the bead at a velocity of 1 m m s (cid:4) 1 forming a membrane tube of length 15 , 25 or 40 m m . The bead was continually monitored for an additional 3 – 10 minutes to measure the axial membrane force during tube relaxation . We report the force measured at the end of tube elongation and during tube relaxation . Analysis of the force Position data collected from the QPD was processed oﬀ - line with MATLAB R2007b ( The Mathworks , Natick , MA ) . To deter - mine the magnitude of the stationary force the position data were digitally filtered at 100 Hz with low - pass Butterworth filter in MATLAB . The magnitude and time course of dynamic events were determined from the raw position data . We developed a list of protocols to discriminate a dynamic event from the inherent noise in the force ( see Fig . 3a ) and to characterise the event : ( i ) Establish if there is a sawtooth within the time series data . To do this the gradient of the force with respect to time ( D F / D t ) was calculated . The jump - slope ( j - slope ) was calculated with a constant number of points ( 1000 – 1500 ) for the entire extent of the recording ( see Fig . 3a ) , i . e . , 1 point every 1 to 1 . 5 seconds . The gradient was then examined as a function of time . An event was counted if the j - slope ( calculated with at most 1000 points , resolution 1 second ) was visible above the j - slope noise ( Fig . 3a ) ; ( ii ) Determine the onset , t (cid:3) 0 , lifetime , D t and magnitude , D F of the rise of any sawtooths found . To establish t (cid:3) 0 we calculated the cumulative slope , ( c - slope , Fig . 4b ) before the rise . The slope ( D F / D t ) was calculated starting with two points about 2 – 3 seconds prior to a rise . For this small number of points the c - slope exhibits a mean value close to zero with a large variance . The number of points for each subsequent calculation increased incrementally and the variance on the slope decreased ( Fig . 4b ) . The c - slope exhibits a final ascent with a value close to zero at the onset of a rise . This time was considered t (cid:3) 0 . To establish D t the j - slope was calculated . We considered the lifetime of the rise to occur when the j - slope was greater than zero ( calculated with at most 1000 points for the rise ) . When the j - slope dropped below zero it was considered to be the start of a stall or a stationary state ; ( iii ) Bundle and average all rise events that exhibit similar time course and magnitude , and determine t (cid:3) 0 , D t and , D F of the averaged events as described in ( ii ) . The time resolution of all Integrative Biology Paper This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 Integr . Biol . , 2013 , 5 , 204 - - 214 207 averaged rise events was 250 to 1000 ms ; ( iv ) Determine the onset , t (cid:3) 0 , lifetime , D t and , magnitude D F of the decay . We used the same procedure as ( ii ) with some changes . We started the calculation B 0 . 2 seconds prior to the onset of the decay . Five to eight points ( 5 to 30 ms of data ) were used to calculate the j - slope . Linear interpolation was used to determine when the j - slope reached zero because of the faster rate . All similar events were averaged and the process repeated . Imaging Images of the cell – tube – bead assembly were obtained with a CCD camera ( DAGE - MTI , CCD100 , Michigan City , IN ) con - nected to microscope and recorded on SVHS tape recorder . The videos were digitally processed and split by Adobe Premiere Pro ( v2 . 0 , Adobe Systems Inc . ) . The audio video interleave ( avi ) files were then processed in MATLAB ( v7 . 0 , The Mathworks , Natick , MA ) by use of the Image Toolbox . Processing involved digitally averaging 15 – 30 images ( about 0 . 5 to 1 second of video data ) subtracting the digitally averaged images obtained when the bead and tube were not in the field of view from subsequent signals , and reducing the colour map range . To estimate the retraction rate of the tube back to the cell upon removal of the trap , we monitored the position of the bead with the CCD camera . In this case the images were not averaged and the time resolution was 30 frames per second . Results Stationary force Long membrane tubes were formed with laser tweezers and the force monitored as the tube relaxed at constant length . 28 The tubes exhibit a stationary force centered at 12 . 7 (cid:5) 3 . 1 pN ( Fig . 2a ) and are stable for times in excess of 500 s . Typically tubes are not cylindrical ( Fig . 1b , ESI , † Movie S1 ) as expected for saline - filled tubes 29 ( ESI , † Movie S2 ) . 29 There is no statistically significant diﬀerence ( a : 0 . 05 ) in the value of the stationary force for tubes of diﬀerent length , but there is a numerical trend ; shorter tubes tended to exhibit a lower force ( L : 15 m m 11 . 6 (cid:5) 2 . 3 pN ) and longer tubes ( L : 25 m m 12 . 6 (cid:5) 3 . 7 pN , L 40 m m 13 . 8 (cid:5) 3 . 0 pN ) tended to exhibit a higher force . The forces measured at the end of tube elongation were dependent upon the length ; this force exhibits two normal distributions centred at 25 and 43 pN . The shortest tubes ( 15 m m ) exhibit the lower value 23 . 4 (cid:5) 3 . 6 pN ( N : 17 / 18 ) while the longest tubes ( 40 m m ) exhibit the higher value 45 (cid:5) 5 . 9 pN ( N : 14 / 18 ) . No length - dependent discrepancies were observed when cytocha - lasin E was added to the bath ( Fig . 2c ) . Cytochalasin E binds to the barbed end of F - actin and disrupts actin bundle formation and forms membrane blebs and invaginations in the plasma membrane ( ESI , † Fig . S1 ) . The force measured at the end of elongation and the stationary force was 17 . 9 (cid:5) 3 . 9 pN and 6 . 1 (cid:5) 1 . 4 pN ( Fig . 2 ) . Because the stationary force in the presence of cytochalasin E is independent of length ( q F / q L = 0 ) we are able to calculate membrane tension , g with g = F / ( 4 p R t ) at 4 (cid:5) 3 m N m (cid:4) 1 with the experimentally determined diameter , 2 R t at 310 ( (cid:5) 80 ) nm ( ESI , † Fig . S2 ) . Under control conditions the classical expressions 29 may not be valid because of evidence of F - actin growth within the tube . This was apparent due to tube shape ( Fig . 1b , see ESI , † Movie S1 ) . It was also evident when we removed the trap , and monitored collapse of the tube back to the cell . The rate of tube collapse was faster under control conditions ( ESI , † Movie S4 , Fig . S3 ) compared to the case when the actin cortex of the cell was disrupted ( ESI , † Movie S2 and S3 ) . We were able to measure the collapse rate for some events and found it to decrease with time . At 1 second it was about 9 and 4 m m s (cid:4) 1 for control and cytochalasin E treated cells ( ESI , † Fig . S3 long tubes , 40 m m ) . Similar diﬀerences were observed for shorter tubes ( 15 m m ) where the rate of retraction was B 2 m m s (cid:4) 1 for control and 0 . 6 m m s (cid:4) 1 in presence of cytochalasin E . Indeed , for shorter tubes and when cortical actin was disrupted the tube – bead assembly appeared to drift back to the cell ( ESI , † Fig . S3 , lower panel , Movie S2 ) clearly indicating a diminished cortical - actin eﬀect compared to the control . The third observation that suggests F - actin was forming in the tube was the presence of a dynamic force riding upon the stationary value ( Fig . 3a ) . We describe a sawtooth transient of the dynamic force as this was the most apparent and clearly repeated pattern in the time series data . Description of the sawtooth force The dynamic force exhibits sawtooth behaviour that increases slowly ( tens of seconds ) in a step - like fashion , stalls and decays much more rapidly back to a stationary value ( ms ) . Dynamic Fig . 2 Stationary force is independent of tether length with and without cytochalasin E in the bath .

In presence of cytochalasin E the force exhibits a single distribution ( N : 30 ) . Solid black ( control ) and red ( cytochalasin E ) are normal probability distribution functions . ( c ) Force measured during relaxation in presence of cytochalasin E . The stationary values are 3 . 7 (cid:5) 0 . 9 pN ( grey ) and 6 . 2 (cid:5) 1 . 0 pN ( black ) .

Biol . , 2013 , 5 , 204 - - 214 This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 stalls are also observed ( Fig . 3a , sawtooth 1 ) . To detect and determine the onset and lifetime of a dynamic event the gradient of the force with respect to time ( D F / D t ) was calculated ( see Methods ) . Dynamic events were detected because of a rapid decay rate ( ms ) compared to a slow rise ( see Fig . 3a , lower panel ) . The magnitude and sign of the j - slope is used to estimate D t and determine the change in the force between two stationary states ( eqn ( 2 ) ) and to specifically discriminate between an event that is slowing down and an event that has reached a stationary value . We considered the lifetime of the rise to occur when the j - slope was greater than zero . When the j - slope dropped below zero it was considered to be the start of a stall or a stationary state . We confirmed that a drop was not an isolated anomaly by verifying the j - slope with diﬀerent numbers of points ( e . g . , 500 – 1500 ) . This is shown in Fig . 3b ( bottom panel ) for j - slopes calculated every 1 ( green ) and 1 . 5 sec - onds ( orange ) . In the example shown the j - slope ( green ) is near zero for 6 . 5 seconds shows a small rise and decay for 3 seconds and then increases above zero to a maximum of 1 . 0 – 1 . 5 pN s (cid:4) 1 , and then returns to zero . D t for the rise ( shown in grey ) is 13 seconds . The smallest change in the force during the rise is shown in Fig . 4a ; the mean change in the force is 3 (cid:5) 0 . 7 pN . To determine the time course we calculate the j - slope ( Fig . 4 , bottom panels ) . The slope increases reaching a maximum and then decreases to reach a value less than zero , and hovers at a stationary state for 2 seconds . The lifetime of the event , D t was 4 s . Three other mean rise events are shown ( Fig . 4b , right panel ) with their corresponding j - slopes . We performed similar analysis when we analyzed the decay of the sawtooth . However , in contrast to the rise we observed two diﬀerent events during the decay that are discriminated by their rate . There is a step - like decay with D F between 2 – 19 pN and D t up to 38 ms ( Fig . 5a and b ) , and a slower decay which starts like a step but exhibits a slower decay back to the stationary value ( Fig . 5e and f ) . D F for this slower phase ranged from 5 to 52 pN with D t up to 670 ms . Events with a time course between the two extremes were also observed . We calculated the c - slope to determine the onset of the decay ( Fig . 5c ) and the j - slope to determine D t ( Fig . 5d ) and averaged events with similar D t and D F . Rate of rise and decay depends upon D F A plot of the rate of rise ( 1 / D t ) versus D F is shown in Fig . 6a . The rate decreases exponentially with D F to exhibit a constant of B (cid:4) 0 . 066 (cid:5) 0 . 014 pN (cid:4) 1 . A rate of 0 . 27 (cid:5) 0 . 04 s (cid:4) 1 is determined when the exponential relationship is extrapolated to zero change in force . These constants were unaﬀected by addition of nocodazole , or ML - 7 ( Fig . 6a ) or the solvent DMSO ( data not shown ) . We describe the rate of rise i . e . , 1 / D t (cid:3) k d in terms of the change in the membrane axial force with D F 1 D t ¼ k d ¼ k off exp (cid:4) l k B T 1 N T D F 1 (cid:2) (cid:3) ð 3 Þ where N T is the total number of working objects . A length constant of B 0 . 269 nm per working object is determined upon Fig . 3 Dynamic sawtooth force rides on top of the stationary value . ( a ) Analysis of sawtooths , bottom panel shows the j - slope calculated with 0 . 5 ( 500 points , ash ) , 1 . 0 ( 1000 points , green ) and 1 . 5 ( 1500 points , orange ) seconds of data .

( b ) Three rise - events ( upper panel ) and their corresponding j - slopes ( bottom panel ) .

Integrative Biology Paper This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 Integr . Biol . , 2013 , 5 , 204 - - 214 209 fitting the slope to eqn ( 3 ) ( ESI , † Table S1 ) . This expression states that the load aﬀects the oﬀ - rate and is dependent upon the magnitude of the exponent . The larger the exponent , ( (cid:4) l / N T k B T ) the slower the oﬀ - rate . The results show the rate of rise slows 3 - fold under a compressive load ( Fig . 6a ) . A plot of the rate of decay ( 1 / D t ) versus | D F | for the fastest and slowest events is shown in Fig . 6b . The rate decreases exponentially with D F to exhibit a constant of (cid:4) 0 . 066 pN (cid:4) 1 ( Fig . 6b , blue ) and 0 . 0254 pN (cid:4) 1 ( Fig . 6b , green ) . We write the decay rate , k p in terms of the change in the membrane axial force (cid:4) D F with 1 D t ¼ k p ¼ ck on exp l k B T 1 N T (cid:4) D F 1 (cid:2) (cid:3) ð 4 Þ where c is the concentration of monomer at the tip . Length constants of 0 . 276 and 0 . 103 nm per working object are determined for the slow and fast phases . An on - rate in the absence of compressive load ranges from 5 . 6 to 99 s (cid:4) 1 . This expression also states that the on - rate is slowed by the com - pressive load . Note the diﬀerent emphasis of the sign in eqn ( 4 ) compared to eqn ( 3 ) . For the decay the length constant is positive and the force is negative . For the rise the length constant is negative and the force is positive ( Fig . 1 ) . Number of working objects Expressions eqn ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) state that the magnitude of N T will aﬀect the rate of rise and rate of fall provided the length constant is the same . The larger N T the less the rates are influenced by the load because more working objects cooperate to reduce the decline . To estimate the number of working objects we re - write eqn ( 2 ) in terms of the values of the stationary force between two adjacent stationary states .

Biol . , 2013 , 5 , 204 - - 214 This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 suggests that F fn should exhibit a linear relationship with respect to F in with a slope of B 1 and a negative or positive intercept with magnitude n i f . The data was grouped according to the magnitude of D F , and the relationships shown in Fig . 7a . The data exhibits several straight lines with a slope close to 1 and an intercept that depends upon the magnitude of the step . This suggests F increases by stepping up and decreases by stepping down by a common diﬀerence of B 2 . 5 pN like an arithmetical progression . Because the common diﬀerence is the same as the initial value , the magnitude of the intercepts at 2 . 5 , 5 , 7 . 5 , 10 , 12 . 5 , 15 pN reflect a series { a , 2a , 3a , 4a , 5a , 6a . . . } where the leading integer is a function of the number of force - bearing objects . The maximum leading integer for the events shown in Fig . 7a is six , suggesting the maximum number of working objects is six . We also estimate the number of working objects by counting the number of events detected within the same force range . The number of working objects is calculated assuming one object is equivalent to 2 . 5 pN ( i . e . , n i (cid:3) D F / 2 . 5 ) . We find the probability of observing an event depends upon the magnitude of D F . The greater the magnitude the lower the probability of observing a decay ( squares ) or rise ( circles ) event . We find n i decreases exponentially with probability exhibiting a similar slope for the rise and decay events . Extrapolating to zero probability a maximum of eight working objects is determined , except for the data observed during the slow decay ( Fig . 7b ) where a much faster decrease ( about 5 fold ) with a greater number of working objects 36 (cid:5) 13 is required to explain the data ( fit is not shown in Fig . 7b ) . This analysis suggests there are six to eight working objects . If the objects are working actin protofilaments where N T (cid:3) 8 ( see eqn ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) ) then a length constant of 2 . 1 – 2 . 2 nm ( ESI , † Table S1 ) is calculated with the experimental derived slopes ( Fig . 6 ) . This calculated length scale is 0 . 7 fold of the expected half length of a single subunit of G - actin at 2 . 7 nm . 10 During the slow on - phase ( Fig . 5e and f ) we calculate a length constant of 1 nm which is much less than single subunit of G - actin . We investigated whether myosin II via the myosin light chain kinase pathway ( MLCK ) was responsible for the dynamic force and found the sawtooth transients were also observed in presence of ML - 7 . In addition , the stationary force and force obtained at end of tube elongation were of similar magnitude to the control at 12 (cid:5) 2 . 6 ( n : 5 ) and 30 . 1 (cid:5) 5 . 3 ( n : 7 ) ( Fig . 2a ) . Likewise the tube shape and movement were also similar to that observed under control conditions ( i . e . , ESI , † Movies S1 ) . We also did not detect a diﬀerence in the time course of the sawtooth at least within the noise of our measurements and at the concentrations of ML - 7 examined , 2 and 20 m M 30 ( Fig . 6 ) . MLCK is found associated with cortical actin . When mast cells are triggered to undergo exocytosis , calcium and calmodulin bind to MLCK to induce F - actin disassembly . 30 In the presence of ML - 7 this activation of MLCK is inhibited and F - actin concentration increases . When the cells are not activated ML - 7 has no eﬀect on F - actin disassembly . 30 If myosin II via MLCK pathway was directly responsible for the sawtooths we would expect them to diminish and not be observed or observed rarely . Although it is likely that ML - 7 had some other subtle eﬀects it did not appear to diminish the dynamic force , especially the sawtooth . Because the cells were not activated it is also improbable that the discrete force ( Fig . 3 ) is due to tension change as a result of exocytosis or endocytosis of secretory vesicles . If exocytosis occurs it should increase the amount of plasma membrane available ( decrease the force ) while endocytosis should decrease the amount of plasma membrane available ( increase the force ) . The stationary force is low ( 12 pN ) and independent ( statistically ) of the length of the tube ( Fig . 2a ) indicating there is excess membrane to form tubes and buﬀer 31 any incidental endocytotic event . In addition cytochalasin E 32 does not inhibit exocytosis and the dynamic events should still have been observable in the presence of this drug . We investigated whether nocodazole which inhibits depoly - merisation of microtubules 33 was responsible for the dynamic force and found the sawtooth was also observed with this toxin . The stationary force and the force obtained at end of elongation in the presence of 10 m M nocodazole were also similar to the control values at 13 . 6 (cid:5) 2 . 5 ( N : 5 ) and 32 . 7 (cid:5) 1 . 09 ( N : 4 ) . In mast cells nocodazole disrupts microtubules near the centrosome Fig . 7 The force is discrete with a mean value of 2 . 5 pN where 8 objects work cooperatively .

Integrative Biology Paper This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 Integr . Biol . , 2013 , 5 , 204 - - 214 211 and within the endoplasmic reticulum to aﬀect calcium release . 34 We also considered that unconventional myosins ( e . g . , myosin 1 , myosin V , and myosin X ) may be participating as they are present in filopodia , 35 but suggest they are an unlikely candidate because of the magnitude of the force measured in the experiments . Briefly , about 25 % of the events exhibited a D F with magnitude greater than 10 pN . This contrasts the maximum force expected for a myosin molecule at 3 pN . 36 Although unconventional myosins can produce a significant force under isometric conditions , there is a low probability that two or more myosin molecules would simultaneously go through their working - stroke to produce a discrete force step > 10 pN . Having considered the above possibilities and deemed them not compelling explanations we propose the rising phase of the sawtooth force results from depolymerisation of F - actin where the decay phase originates from polymerisation of F - actin . This suggests that actin is attached to the membrane and the concentration of monomeric actin at the tip of the tube hovers below but near the critical concentration . The measured value of D F = f B 2 . 5 pN ( eqn ( 2 ) , Fig . 7 ) is comparable to the force per filopodium at 3 pN produced by actin polymerisation by growing dorsal root ganglia . 21 The force is 3 - fold more than the value obtained from isolated filaments at B 1 . 0 pN for both a single filament attached to formin 19 or a growing bundle of filaments polymerizing . 18 In the latter report they suggest cooperativity was absent and only one filament was in contact with the barrier . We suggest cooperativity is present ( Fig . 6 , ESI , † Table S1 ) and there is more than 1 filament in contact with the membrane . Discussion Filaments are not always treadmilling We report the measurement of a pulling force which we associate with depolymerisation of actin ( Fig . 1 – 4 ) . This suggests that F - actin is attached to the membrane during depolymerisation and the filaments are not always treadmilling . 37 , 38 This ( lack of treadmilling ) is an unexpected result as head - to - tail poly - merisation of actin is considered to be the dominant mode of actin turnover in cells . 1 One reason for this observation may be that the flux of monomeric actin to the tip of the long membrane tube is low , thereby increasing the probability of detecting actin depolymerisation . This reasoning is analogous to the strategy used to measure depolymerisation rates in isolated filaments . The concentration of monomeric actin is lowered to determine oﬀ - rates of actin . 39 – 41 Another possibility is that the gradient force due to the light may influence growth especially at the edge of the bead adjacent to the tube . It was shown that actin poly - merization - driven lamellipodia growth is stimulated by low power ( 20 – 120 mW ) light in growth cones . 42 However , recent results in hair cells show that actin turnover in stereocilia does not necessarily occur by treadmilling . They suggest depolymer - isation of actin ( not just polymerisation ) may account for the turnover at the tip of the stereocilia . 43 We did not measure sawtooth transients for longer tubes ( B 40 m m in length ) suggesting that a length of B 25 m m may represent a limit , which is consistent with other experiments . 22 , 44 The growth rate of F - actin within the tubes ( 0 . 15 to 0 . 25 m m s (cid:4) 145 ) is also similar to reported rates . 22 , 26 An intact cortical actin is required to support the growth of the F - actin bundle within the tube . This was apparent when we removed the trap , and monitored collapse of the tube back to the cell where a faster rate was found under control conditions . Further examination and modelling of the time course of the rate of tube collapse should reveal the viscoelastic properties of the actin cortex and indicate the presence of F - actin growth within the tube . On and oﬀ transitions are thermodynamically uncoupled Kinetic arguments predict that an axial membrane compressive load should aﬀect the rate of depolymerisation as well as the rate of polymerisation . 11 , 12 This prediction is in agreement with our observations ( Fig . 6 ) . The unexpected result of this work is the evidence that transitions appear to be thermodynamically uncoupled . We suggest this because the exponents of eqn ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) have the same negative sign ; the compressive load slows both the on and oﬀ - rates ( ESI , † Fig . 6 , Table S1 ) . This decrease is 3 - fold . Theory shows that kinetics transitions that traverse the same free energy barrier should exhibit an exponent of diﬀerent sign or be independent of the load . For example , if the on - rate decreased with load then the oﬀ - rate should increase with load or not be aﬀected by load . 11 This result suggests at least for the compressive load on the membrane that the on and oﬀ transitions are thermodynamically uncoupled and traverse diﬀerent free - energy pathways . The influence of load on the kinetics of microtubule growth shows that a load either slows the on - rate and does not aﬀect the oﬀ - rate , or slows the on - rate and quickens the oﬀ - rate . 46 In models for actin polymerisation it is usually assumed that a load only slows the on - rate . 47 – 49 In their examples , the on and oﬀ processes are coupled and describe forward and backward transitions over the same free - energy barrier . In contrast , our results suggest that the on and oﬀ transitions traverse diﬀerent free - energy pathways . Although more data is required to verify this result , if correct it implies that bundled structures found in cells exhibit elaborate kinetics compared to those of isolated filaments . Mechanism for actin polymerisation and depolymerisation There are several mechanisms to explain how actin filaments push the membrane upon polymerisation , 47 , 49 but none of them consider the opposite possibility of pulling the membrane during depolymer - isation . This observation requires that filaments are attached to the membrane during depolymerisation and exhibit a type of stepping - end - tracking mechanism 47 ( Fig . 8 , Scheme 1 ) . This scheme requires linker proteins to attach the actin filaments to the membrane . Although several proteins may participate , for simplicity we only include one flexible linker . During depolymerisation we suggest that the linker detaches from the n + 2 position of the filament and binds to the n + 1 position , after which the monomer escapes . We frequently observed a decrease in the force prior to the rise ( Fig . 3 , lower panel , black arrows ) and speculate that this could represent the linkers re - arranging prior to binding at the n + 1 position . Paper Integrative Biology 212 Integr . Biol . , 2013 , 5 , 204 - - 214 This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 Because the transitions appear uncoupled we suggest dif - ferent pathways for polymerisation . We propose linkers first detach from one of the protofilaments and attach to a sur - rounding filament , and then either polymerize on the filament they just detached from as proposed by the Brownian tethered ratchet mechanism 49 ( Fig . 8 , Scheme 2 upper ) or polymerise on the newly attached filament 47 ( Fig . 8 , Scheme 2 lower ) . Our data cannot discriminate between the two common mechanisms used to describe actin polymerisation . Linkers convert chemical energy to kinetic energy that drives the mechanical motion of the membrane . We do not suggest that ATP hydrolysis is required ( cf . ref . 47 ) rather that monomer addition and removal provides the energy to push and pull the membrane . A likely candidate for one of the transducer mole - cules is the formin family of proteins especially Diaphanous - related formins ( Drf ) as they nucleate and track processively at the barbed - end of linear actin arrays 50 , 51 and allow for the assembly of long F - actin arrays in filopodia . 52 Models for pro - cessive association suggest the translation of the formin ( FH2 dimer ) is equivalent to the length of a G - actin molecule . 50 , 51 However , the models do not consider movement of the plasma membrane . In addition , there is paucity of evidence that formins support membrane binding . There is evidence that one of the formins binds to the membrane via a membrane protein 53 and that phospholipids may bind to the protein . 54 If formins are indeed the transducers it is more likely that a protein – membrane linker is attached to each protofilament because they exist as dimers . 55 An alternative explanation is that there is a second linker between the membrane and formin , as suggested for N - WASP capture of branched actin filaments . 56 A first order rate constant for actin polymerisation of 7 . 4 – 10 m M s (cid:4) 1 is determined in isolated filaments . 39 – 41 We did not determine this rate constant only the product of the local concen - tration and the rate constant ( see eqn ( 4 ) ) . Although the fastest on - rate ( 100 s (cid:4) 1 ) is comparable to values found in cells , 57 the sampling rate ( 1 kHz ) and noise of our recording ( the j - slope was calculated with at least 5 ms of data , Fig . 5d ) limits the robustness of this estimate . Our recent measurements with a similar laser trap indicate the dynamical response of the trap is > 3000 s (cid:4) 1 suggesting the response of the trap was not limiting . 58 We determine an oﬀ - rate ( 0 . 27 s (cid:4) 1 ) which is 2 – 4 fold less than that measured on isolated actin filaments at 0 . 64 – 1 . 4 s (cid:4) 1 . 39 – 41 The oﬀ - rate has not been reported in cells . This estimate is not limited by sampling rate . Several studies suggest that the moving object ( e . g . bead or membrane ) is tethered to the actin network ( e . g . , Fig . 8 , Scheme 2 ) for robust actin - based motility . 56 , 59 , 60 There is a debate whether the discrete movement of the object should reflect the size of mono - meric actin . One experimental report supports the suggestion 16 while other experimental and computational studies disagree . 59 – 61 A length constant between 0 . 1 to 0 . 27 nm per working object is calculated from the kinetic data ( ESI , † Table S1 ) . This suggests 10 – 28 protofilaments ( N T (cid:3) 10 – 28 ) would need to be attached to the membrane to achieve a l equivalent to half a G - actin subunit at 2 . 7 nm . Although this is a reasonable number for filopodia , the maximum number of protofilaments detected was about eight from which we estimate a l of B 1 – 2 nm ( Fig . 7 ) . Although we favour the idea that the filaments are cooperating to prevent the rate from decreasing , i . e . exp ( (cid:4) n i D F l / N T k B T ) , ( D F = 2 . 5 pN , n i : working filaments , Fig . 6 and 7 ) . We acknowledge that the experi - ments cannot discriminate if the slope reflects the cooperative decrease , i . e . , exp ( (cid:4) n i D F l / k B T ) in the rate as a result of breakage and formation of many attachments bonds . The latter describes the cooperative thermal breakage model . 60 Further studies are required to determine if the discrete nature of motility is a direct correspon - dence of the G - actin subunit length and / or reflective of the other participants , ( e . g . , the putative protein linkages that connect actin to the membrane and determine the transduction eﬃciency ) . Determine chemical kinetics of actin polymerisation in cancer cells One objective is to develop this methodology to measure the rate constants in cancer cells , and establish if the magnitude Fig . 8 Pathway for actin depolymerisation ( Scheme 1 ) and polymerisation ( Scheme 2 ) . Scheme 1 . Two of the protein linkers , crisscross from the ( n + 2 ) to the ( n + 1 ) position and pull the membrane towards the cell with rate constant k 1 , and the same two monomers at position ( n + 2 ) escape to the cytoplasm with rate constant k 3 . Scheme 2 . Upper : Monomers bind only to filaments without linkers . A monomer binds at the ( n + 2 ) position of the 4th filament after which a protein linker dissociates from the 5th and binds to the 4th pushing the membrane forward . A second monomer then binds to the ( n + 2 ) position of the 5th filament . Lower : binding of monomer to filaments with a linker attached . A monomer binds at the ( n + 1 ) position ( 4th filament ) and this linker then moves to the adjacent filament pushing the membrane forward . A second monomer binds to the ( n + 2 ) position of the 3rd filament and the linker on this filament dissociates and rebinds to the ( n + 2 ) position of the 5th filament pushing the membrane forward . The symbols represent G : monomeric actin , M : membrane , F : filament ; T : protein linker and the subscript the filament number . The rate constants , k are shown where odd and even subscripts represent depolymerisation and polymerisation . Integrative Biology Paper This journal is c The Royal Society of Chemistry 2013 Integr . Biol . , 2013 , 5 , 204 - - 214 213 and time course of the protrusive force correlates with the mobility of cancer cells . 6 , 7 Additional experimental manipula - tions are to be conducted . They include : ( i ) controlled manip - ulation of biological pathways ( e . g . , epidermal growth factor pathway ) to form the F - actin filled tubes at physiological temperature of 37 1 C ; ( ii ) establishing if the chemistry and size of the bead aﬀect the time course , where a large bead improves the dynamic range of the force 62 while a smaller bead improves the fidelity of the time course ; 58 ( iii ) examine the spectral components of the force to reveal additional states not appar - ent with time domain analysis ; ( iv ) use of fluorescence micro - scopy to image F - actin and other key proteins ( e . g . , formins ) in the tube , and speckle fluorescence microscopy 57 to measure rates concurrently with the force . Conclusions ( 1 ) The plasma membrane reflects force production that occurs within the cytoplasm adjacent to the membrane . In this example the force arises from synthesis and break - down of F - actin . This assay could be adapted to measure other cytoskeletal - based forces . ( 2 ) The rate of bond formation and breakage is revealed from the time course of the membrane force . Development of meth - odology to reduce the noise and expand the bandwidth should improve the fidelity of the measured rate and rate constants . ( 3 ) We observe separate pathways that we associate with actin polymerisation and depolymerisation . This suggests the kinetics within cells is more complex than that described for isolated filaments and requires theoretical development . ( 4 ) The observation of the pulling force which we associate with depolymerisation implies the membrane is attached to the bundle and the filaments are not always treadmilling . This could be a function of experimental manipulation . Further studies will establish if this pulling force contributes to cell contraction during cell mobility .
