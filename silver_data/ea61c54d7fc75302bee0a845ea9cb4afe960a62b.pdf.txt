A random subsample of 150 Finnish women who had serum samples taken during the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy and had a second pregnancy during a 5 year follow - up period was selected , grouped by age of ﬁrst pregnancy . The polyomavirus antibody levels were similar in samples taken during the ﬁrst and second pregnancies ( correlation coefﬁcient 0 ? 93 for BKV SB and 0 ? 94 for JCV ) . Analysis of serum samples from 290 Swedish children aged 1 – 13 years , grouped by age in 2 year intervals , demonstrated that BKV seropositivity increased rapidly with increasing age of the children , reaching 98 % seroprevalence at 7 – 9 years of age , followed by a minor decrease . JCV seroprevalence increased only slowly with increasing age and reaching 72 % positivity among mothers > 25 years of age . The age - speciﬁc seroprevalence of the human polyomaviruses measured using this VLP - based EIA was similar to previous serosurveys by other methods . The stability of the antibodies over time indicates that polyomavirus seropositivity is a valid marker of cumulative virus exposure , and polyoma VLP - based EIAs may therefore be useful for epidemiological studies of these viruses . INTRODUCTION Human polyomaviruses are endemic and infect a large proportion of mankind worldwide . Primary infections with the human polyomaviruses BK virus ( BKV ) and JC virus ( JCV ) occur during childhood and are largely asymptomatic ( Dorries , 1998 ) . Following primary infection , both BKV and JCV persist as latent infections in the kidneys and B lymphocytes ( Shah , 1996 ) . Under conditions of severe immunosuppression such as leukaemia , AIDS and organ transplantation both viruses may be reactivated and cause disease . Reactivation of BKV is mainly related to urinary tract diseases such as haemor - rhagic cystitis , ureteric stenosis , glomerulonephritis and graft nephropathy ( Barbanti - Brodano et al . , 1998 ; Limaye et al . , 2001 ) . JCV can be reactivated and induces the CNS disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( Hou & Major , 2000 ) . The human polyomaviruses have in vitro transforming abilities , similar to the mouse polyomavirus and the monkey polyomavirus simian virus 40 ( SV40 ) ( Barbanti - Brodano et al . , 1998 ) . In recent years a possible association of polyomaviruses with human cancer has been reported . JCV has been detected in certain brain tumours , in particular oligoastrocytoma . SV40 was present in polio vaccines produced in rhesus monkey kidney cells during the 1950s and has been detected in several human tumours , including choroid plexus tumours and ependy - momas ( Del Valle et al . , 2001 ; Rencic et al . , 1996 ; Shah , 1996 ) . BKV has also been detected in a variety of tumours , including neuroblastoma ( Flaegstad et al . , 1999 ) . These reports have created a renewed interest in the epidemiology of these infections ( Barbanti - Brodano et al . , 1998 ) . Haemagglutination inhibition ( HI ) has been the standard method for measurement of antibody titres to BKV and JCV ( Hamilton et al . , 2000 ) . About 70 – 90 % of healthy adults are seropositive by HI ( Shah , 1996 ) . Seroconversion for BK infection occurs in early childhood and JC seroconversion occurs in late childhood . A study from the USA reported antibodies to BKV in 50 % of children aged 3 – 4 years and almost all children were seropositive by 10 years of age . 0001 - 8842 G 2003 SGM Printed in Great Britain 1499 Journal of General Virology ( 2003 ) , 84 , 1499 – 1504 DOI 10 . 1099 / vir . 0 . 18842 - 0 Downloaded from www . microbiologyresearch . org by IP : 54 . 70 . 40 . 11 On : Sat , 11 May 2019 18 : 41 : 32 Antibodies to JCV had been acquired by 50 % of children aged 10 – 14 years and about 75 % of adults ( Shah , 1996 ) . Four antigenic variants of BKV have been described : the BKV prototype , BKV AS , BKV SB and BKV IV ( Jin et al . , 1993a ) . Each strain has been characterized by nucleotide sequencing of the VP1 region , which encodes the major capsid protein of BKV . Speciﬁc variations correlate with serological typing by HI . These BKV strains were isolated from urine specimens from several patient groups ( Jin et al . , 1993b ) . In recent years viral serology based on virus - like particles ( VLPs ) in enzyme immunoassays ( EIAs ) has become widely used ( Dillner , 1999 ) . EIAs using speciﬁc antigens of BKV and JCV have shown a greater sensitivity and precision compared with HI ( Hamilton et al . , 2000 ) . The objective of the present study was to establish a modern seroepidem - iological technology based on yeast - expressed VLPs of JCV , the two major BKV strains , AS and SB , and SV40 ( Hale et al . , 2002 ) , to investigate the stability of polyomavirus antibodies in serial samples over time and to investigate the incidenceandage - speciﬁcprevalenceofthesevirusinfections . METHODS Study population . A total of 590 serum samples were analysed for antibodies to polyomaviruses . Serum samples from a consecutive series of 1031 serum samples from children aged between 0 and 13 years were originally obtained from the Department of Clinical Virology , Karolinska Hospital , Sweden , and have been characterized in a previous study of the seroepidemiology of papillomavirus infec - tion ( af Geijersstam et al . , 1999 ) . The children were grouped in age groups of 2 year intervals and a random subsample of 290 sera was selected . In this study , 50 serum samples each were obtained from the groups of children aged 1 ? 1 – 3 , 3 ? 1 – 5 , 5 ? 1 – 7 , 7 ? 1 – 9 and 9 ? 1 – 11 years of age and 40 serum samples were obtained from chil - dren aged 11 ? 1 – 13 years . A total of 1656 serum samples originated from the Finnish Maternity Cohort ( FMC ) of the National Public Health Institute , Finland . The samples were randomly chosen from the FMC serum bank collected in the population - based serologic screening programme for congenital infections in the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy ( af Geijersstam et al . , 1998 ; Kibur et al . , 2000 ) . In this study , a subsample of 300 serum samples taken from 150 women during their ﬁrst and second pregnancies was collected . The women were grouped by age at ﬁrst pregnancy and had a second pregnancy during a 5 - year follow - up period . In this study , there were 50 women each aged 14 – 19 , 20 – 25 and 26 – 31 years at their ﬁrst pregnancy . Polyoma VLPs . VLPs are based on the major capsid protein , VP1 . The VP1 coding sequences were incorporated into the yeast expres - sion vector pFX7 under the control of the galactose - inducible pro - moter ( Gedvilaite et al . , 2000 ; Sasnauskas et al . , 1999 ) . The pFX7 - derived expression plasmids carrying the VP1 genes were trans - formed into the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae for cultivation . Polyoma VLPs from JCV , from the two antigenic variants of BKV ( strains AS and SB ) and from SV40 were produced in S . cerevisiae cells . Yeast transformation , cultivation and recombinant protein puriﬁcation were carried out as described previously ( Gedvilaite et al . , 2000 ; Sasnauskas et al . , 1999 ) . Following disruption of yeast cells , lysate was centrifuged at 3000 g for 10 min at 4 ˚ C . Supernatants were then loaded on to a chilled 30 % sucrose cushion and ultracentrifuged at 100000 g for 3 h at 4 ˚ C . Resulting pellets were resuspended in 4 ml chilled disruption buffer and loaded on to CsCl gradients ranging from 1 ? 23 to 1 ? 38 g ml 2 1 and centrifuged at 100000 g for 48 h . Fractions of 1 ml were collected and subjected to SDS - PAGE analysis . Fractions containing protein corresponding to a molecular mass of ~ 40 – 45 kDa were pooled , diluted with 1 ? 31 g CsCl ml 2 1 and recentrifuged on a second CsCl gradient . Fractions were again collected and those containing VP1 were pooled and dialysed against PBS and analysed by SDS - PAGE , Western blot , electron microscopy ( Fig . 1 ) and HI . Serological analysis . An EIA based on puriﬁed VLPs was used to detect the presence of speciﬁc antibodies in human sera . The opti - mum concentration of polyomavirus VLPs and the serum dilutions used were determined by titration using the positive and negative controls . For all viruses , puriﬁed VLPs were added to the wells at a concentration of 6 ? 25 ng per well in ice - cold PBS ( pH 7 ? 2 ) . Half - area Costar 3690 EIA plates were incubated overnight at 4 ˚ C . After washing with 0 ? 1 % PBS / Tween , a blocking buffer consisting of 10 % horse serum in PBS ( HS - PBS ) was added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature . The serum samples were diluted 1 : 40 in HS - PBS and incubated for 2 h at room temperature . The plates were washed ﬁve times with 150 m l PBS / Tween and an anti - human IgG mouse monoclonal antibody ( Eurodiagnostica ) diluted 1 : 800 was added and incubated for 90 min at room temperature . The plates were washed ﬁve times with 150 m l PBS / Tween and peroxidase - conjugated goat anti - mouse IgG ( Southern Biotechnology ) diluted 1 : 2000 was added and incubated at room temperature for 60 min . Following another washing step , the peroxidase substrate ( ABTS ) was added and incubated for 30 min at room temperature and the absorbance measured at 415 nm . Fig . 1 .

The antibody was used as positive control , diluted 1 : 10000 . Human reference sera from three renal transplant recipients , who tested positive for BKV DNA in urine by PCR , were used as positive controls . The sera were used at a dilution twofold lower than the endpoint titre : 1 : 10240 , 1 : 640 and 1 : 40960 , respectively . The reference sera were provided by the Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control . A pool of sera from healthy blood donors obtained from the Blood Donor Centre ( Karolinska Hospital , Sweden ) was also used as a positive control serum , diluted 1 : 40 . One of the serum samples obtained from the Department of Clinical Virology ( Karolinska Hospital , Sweden ) from a child aged 1 year and 9 months was used as negative control serum . For deﬁnition of cut - off values , the mean value and standard deviation ( SD ) were calculated from the log - transformed absorbance values in the group of children between 1 ? 1 and 3 years of age and the cut - off values deﬁned as the mean value plus 1 SD of the log absorbance values among the 1 ? 1 – 3 - year - old children . Zero absorbance values were set to half of the lowest detectable absorbance before log transformation . RESULTS The antibody titres against BKV AS and SB were strongly correlated with each other , with the titres and seropreva - lences generally being slightly higher for the BKV SB strain ( Fig . 2a ; Fig . 3 ; Table 1 ) . Seropositivity for AS with concomitant seronegativity for SB was uncommon and found in less than 5 % of samples ( Table 1 ; compare seroprevalences of total BKV with those of SB or AS ) . Fig . 2 .

The same sera that were used in Fig . 2 were also assayed for antibody reactivity against SV40 . Antibodies reactive with SV40 VLPs were found in 20 – 60 % of human sera , with the age distribution closely following the AS seroprevalence distribution among age groups ( data not shown ) . The SV40 antibody titres were strongly correlated to the BKV titres , in particular to the AS titres ( r = 0 ? 70 ) . There were also signiﬁcant correlations between SV40 antibody levels and SB antibody levels ( r = 0 ? 56 ) , as well as with JCV antibody levels ( r = 0 ? 30 ) . SV40 antibody testing by this assay was therefore not considered to be speciﬁc and was discontinued . The BKV and JCV seropositivities were quite stable over time in the 5 - year follow - up study of pregnant women ( Fig . 4a , b ) . For both BKV SB and JCV , there were no cases of seroconversion on follow - up and no cases of seroreversion ( loss of seropositivity ) . The correlation between the anti - body titres in the ﬁrst and second pregnancies was very high : the correlation coefﬁcient was 0 ? 93 for SB and 0 ? 94 for JC ( Fig . 4a , b ) . Repeat testing of the sera from the pregnant women several months apart found that interassay variability was of the same magnitude as the biological variability over time ( coefﬁcient of variation ( CV ) for repeat testing of same samples : 21 ? 5 % for SB and 25 ? 1 % for JC ; CV for variability between analysis of samples taken at ﬁrst pregnancy compared with analysis of samples taken at second pregnancy : 19 ? 9 % for SB and 27 ? 1 % for JC ) . Most of the variability in percentage of absorbance readings was seen for either very low absorbance readings close to zero or very high absorbance readings . In no case did the interassay variability result in a ‘seroconversion’ . BKV seropositivity increased rapidly with increasing age of the children , reaching 98 % seroprevalence at 7 – 9 years of Table 1 .

However , among mothers > 25 years of age , there was a high BK seroprevalence of > 96 % ( Fig . 3 ) . In contrast , the JCV seroprevalences increased more slowly with increasing age and reached the highest seroprevalence ( 72 % ) among the mothers > 25 years of age ( Table 1 ; Fig . 3 ) . DISCUSSION The present study has established a VLP - based EIA for human polyomaviruses . The fact that antibody titres were generally stable over time during a 5 year follow - up indicates that polyomavirus VLP antibodies are a valid marker of polyomavirus cumulative incidences over substantial time spans , thus enabling a meaningful interpretation of seroprevalence data . The fact that the age - speciﬁc sero - prevalence was similar to that reported in other serosurveys also suggests the validity of the VLP EIA ( Dorries , 1998 ; Shah , 1996 ) . The absence of seroconversions , in spite of the fact that we studied a sizeable cohort of women followed for up to 5 years , indicates that the incidence of new infections with these viruses is a rare event . The titres against the two antigenic variants of BKV ( strains AS and SB ) were strongly correlated to each other , but the titres were generally higher for the BKV SB strain . Differences in the DNA sequences encoding the VP1 gene are reported to be responsible for the serotypic variability . In the whole VP1 region there are only ﬁve amino acid differences between the AS and SB strains ( Jin et al . , 1993b ) . Sequencing of clinical isolates of BKV has found that the SB strain is more frequent in the human population than AS ( Jin et al . , 1993a ) . SB VLPs have also been found to have a broader cross - reactivity with the four BKV antigenic types than the other strains ( Hale et al . , 2002 ) . As seropositivity for AS in samples seronegative for SB was uncommon it appears that assays based on SB VLPs will be sufﬁcient for valid BKV serology in general . The abundant presence of antibodies reactive with SV40 VLPs in human sera might be due to cross - reactivity with human polyomaviruses , as suggested by the close cor - relation of BKV AS and SV40 VLP antibody data . To enable serological studies of possible SV40 infections in humans , further work will be required to establish serological assays for SV40 that lack cross - reactivity with human polyomaviruses . Recombinant DNA technology has been applied to express polyomavirus structural protein genes , both in prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems . The polyoma VLPs used in this study were based on the major capsid protein , VP1 , and produced in yeast cells from S . cerevisiae ( Gedvilaite et al . , 2000 ; Sasnauskas et al . , 1999 ) . VLPs of JCV have also been expressed in Escherichia coli and polyomavirus VP1 will also assemble into capsid - like particles in the nucleus of insect cells when expressed in the baculovirus system ( An et al . , 2000 ; Ou et al . , 1999 ) . Yeast - derived recombinant VLPs offer many advantages over other expression systems in terms of protein yield , cost and ease of protein expression ( Hale et al . , 2002 ; Sasnauskas et al . , 1999 ) . In this study , we found such VLPs to be highly serologically reactive , with an optimum amount of VLPs as low as 6 ng per well . The yeast VLP - based assays are therefore likely to be useful in determining past exposure to BKV and JCV in epidemiological studies and for serological diagnosis in patients at risk of polyomavirus - associated diseases or showing early signs of complications due to polyomavirus reactivation .
