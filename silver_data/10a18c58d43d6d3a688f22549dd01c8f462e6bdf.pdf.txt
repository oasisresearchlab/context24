L E T T E R S 894 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 7 | NUMBER 9 | SEPTEMBER 2005 Listeria hijacks the clathrin - dependent endocytic machinery to invade mammalian cells Esteban Veiga 1 and Pascale Cossart 1 , 2 The bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes uses the surface protein InlB to invade a variety of cell types 1 – 3 . The interaction of InlB with the hepatocyte growth - factor receptor , Met , is crucial for infection to occur 3 . Remarkably , the ubiquitin ligase Cbl is rapidly recruited to InlB - activated Met 4 . Recent studies have shown that ligand - dependent endocytosis of Met and other receptor tyrosine kinases is triggered by monoubiquitination of the receptor , a process that is mediated by Cbl 5 – 8 . Here , we show that purified InlB induces the Cbl - dependent monoubiquitination and endocytosis of Met . We then demonstrate that the bacterium exploits the ubiquitin - dependent endocytosis machinery to invade mammalian cells . First , we show that L . monocytogenes colocalizes with Met , EEA1 , Cbl , clathrin and dynamin during entry . Then , we assess the role of different proteins of the endocytic machinery during L . monocytogenes infection . Over - expression or down - regulation of Cbl , respectively , increases or decreases bacterial invasion . Furthermore , RNA interference - mediated knock - down of major components of the endocytic machinery ( for example , clathrin , dynamin , eps15 , Grb2 , CIN85 , CD2AP , cortactin and Hrs ) , inhibit bacterial entry , establishing that the endocytic machinery is key to the bacterial internalization process . We first tested whether L . monocytogenes infection promotes the ubiq - uitination of Met . To do this , epithelial HeLa cells , in which bacterial entry is InlB - dependent , were infected with L . monocytogenes or treated with purified InlB ( Fig . 1a ) for 2 min and Met was immunoprecipitated . The amount of ubiquitinated proteins that were associated with Met increased following infection with L . monocytogenes . This effect was more pronounced using purified InlB , indicating that InlB triggers the ubiquitination of Met or of Met - associated proteins . After immunopre - cipitation , Met complexes were dissociated and Met was then re - immu - noprecipitated . In the resulting samples , ubiquitin was detectable only in the lane corresponding to InlB - treated cells ( Fig . 1b ) , establishing that InlB induces the ubiquitination of Met . Samples corresponding to InlB - treated cells presented lower amounts of Met , suggesting that Met was degraded after its InlB - dependent ubiquitination . To test this hypothesis , 1 Unité des Interactions Bactéries - Cellules , Institut Pasteur ; INSERM U604 , INRA USC2020 , 28 rue du Dr Roux , 75015 Paris , France . 2 Correspondence should be addressed to P . C . ( e - mail : pcossart @ pasteur . fr ) Published online : 21 August 2005 ; DOI : 10 . 1038 / ncb1292 we performed anti - Met immunoblots on total - cell extracts . The treat - ment with InlB strongly reduced the amount of Met ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1 ) . The degradation of Met following ligand activation has been described as both proteasomal - 9 or lysosomal - 10 dependent . We therefore tested the effect of the proteasome inhibitors clasto - β - lactacys - tin lactone and epoximycin on the degradation of Met and found that they did not prevent InlB - dependent degradation of Met . By contrast , the presence of ammonium chloride or bafilomycin - A1 — two lyso - somal inhibitors — significantly protected Met from degradation ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1 ) . These data strongly supported the InlB - induced degradation of Met in lysosomes . Ligand - dependent endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of receptor tyrosine kinases ( RTKs ) is normally triggered by monoubiquitination of the receptor 7 , 8 . However , ligand - dependent ubiquitination of Met has been reported to be either polyubiquitination 10 , 11 or monoubiquitina - tion 12 . To establish the nature of the InlB - dependent ubiquitination of Met , we used two monoclonal antibodies ( mAbs ) — FK1 , which only binds polyubiquitin 8 ; and P4D1 , which recognizes both mono - and poly - ubiquitinated proteins ( Fig . 1c , d ) . FK1 did not recognize ubiquitinated Met after addition of InlB to cells , whereas P4D1 did , strongly suggesting that InlB induces the monoubiquitination of Met . To study whether InlB induces endocytosis of Met , we used a biotin - based assay for internalization of cell - surface proteins 13 . Cell - surface proteins were labelled with a biotin derivative ( Sulpho - NHS - SS - biotin ) . Cells were then treated with InlB and allowed to internalize biotinylated Met . Biotin was then removed from the cell surface ( see Methods ) , and biotinylated / endocytosed proteins were recovered by precipitation , followed by immunodetection of Met . As shown in Fig . 1e , the presence of InlB protected biotinylated Met from debiotinylation , indicating that InlB induced the endocytosis of Met . Together , these data definitively established that InlB induces the monou - biquitination and subsequent endocytosis of Met . We then analysed the role of Cbl in the InlB - dependent ubiquitination and degradation of Met using RNA interference ( RNAi ) . Cells in which Cbl was knocked - down ( Fig . 1f ) were strongly impaired in InlB - depend - ent ubiquitination and degradation of Met ( Fig . 1g ) , demonstrating that Cbl is responsible , at least partially , for the InlB - induced monoubiquiti - nation and degradation of Met . print ncb1292 . indd 894 print ncb1292 . indd 894 12 / 8 / 05 11 : 20 : 56 am 12 / 8 / 05 11 : 20 : 56 am Nature PublishingGroup © 2005 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 7 | NUMBER 9 | SEPTEMBER 2005 895 L E T T E R S As purified InlB induces the endocytosis of Met , we then analysed whether L . monocytogenes , expressing InlB at its surface , hijacks the endo - cytic machinery to enter into cells . First , and as we previously reported 14 , we observed that Met still colocalized with bacteria at the entry sites after 10 min of bacterial infection ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S2 ) . In agreement with these observations , Met degradation after incubation of cells with L . monocytogenes occurs later and to a lesser extent , compared with observations using soluble InlB ( Fig . 2a ) . These data are in line with a recent report showing that endocytosis of large particles , such as viruses , is slower than that of macromolecules 15 . We also observed that shortly after entry ( 10 min of bacterial infection ) , in agreement with our previous findings 16 , L . monocytogenes and Met colocalized with EEA1 , a marker of early endosomes ( Fig . 2b ) . Together , these data suggested a direct coupling of Met endocytosis and bacterial entry . To further challenge the hypothesis that L . monocytogenes entry involved the endocytosis machinery , we first tested whether Cbl was recruited at the sites of bacterial entry . We infected HeLa cells that expressed an HA - tagged version of Cbl 11 with a superinvasive strain of L . monocytogenes ( BUG 1641 ) . As shown in Fig . 3A , Cbl was rapidly recruited to the entry site of L . monocytogenes . We then analysed bac - terial entry into cells in which expression of Cbl was knocked - down by RNAi .

Intracellular , invasive , bacteria were counted by plat - ing cell lysates . As shown in Fig . 3B , a threefold decrease in bacterial invasion was detected in Cbl - knockdown cells . The role of Cbl during bacterial invasion was also tested in cells expressing a dominant - nega - tive form of Cbl ( v - Cbl ) 11 that lacked the ubiquitin ligase RING domain ( Fig . 3C ) . A threefold decrease in bacterial invasion , measured by dif - ferential immunofluoresce labelling , was detected as in the RNAi experi - ments . Strikingly , HeLa cells overexpressing wild - type Cbl ( Ha - tagged Cbl ) showed an ~ eightfold increase in L . monocytogenes invasion , high - lighting the key role of Cbl activity in bacterial infection . Furthermore , overexpression of ubiquitin or monoubiquitin ( the K9 , 48 , 63R mutant that produces monoubiquitin only 8 ) increased the infection rate by 3 – 4 times ( Fig . 3D ) , and ubiquitin localized rapidly with bacteria during L . monocytogenes infection ( Fig . 3E ) . To determine whether L . monocytogenes invasion requires other proteins of the endocytic machinery , we analysed the recruitment of clathrin and dynamin to entering bacteria . To do this , we infected HeLa cells expressing clathrin - light - chain – GFP ( green fluorescent protein ) 15 or dynamin - 2 – GFP 17 with L . monocytogenes for 5 min . As shown in Supplementary Information , Figs S3A and S3B , both clathrin – GFP and dynamin – GFP are recruited to the L . monocytogenes entry site . In addition to the analysis of GFP - tagged proteins , the recruitment of endogenous clathrin and dynamin to the bacterial entry site was investigated using specific anti - clathrin and anti - dynamin antibodies by indirect immunoflourescence . Endogenous clathrin ( Fig . 4a ) and dynamin ( Fig . 4b ) were both detected at bacterial entry sites . They were not detected on extracellular bacteria , confirming the specificity of the antibodies . The presence of endogenous clathrin at the L . mono - cytogenes entry site was confirmed by confocal microscopy followed by three - dimensional reconstruction of confocal stack images ( see Supplementary Information , Movies 1 – 3 ) . Remarkably , the endogenous clathrin is recruited and surrounds entering and internalized bacteria . Together , these data definitively established that clathrin and dynamin — two major components of the endocytic machinery — are recruited to L . monocytogenes during entry . As well as Cbl , clathrin and dynamin , several other proteins are involved in the ligand - induced endocytosis of Met and other RTKs 18 , including eps15 ( a ubiquitin - binding protein that may be involved in the recruitment of clathrin to the pits ) 18 , Grb2 ( an adaptor protein that can direct Cbl to activated receptors and is involved in the cargo entry into the clathrin - coated pit ) 18 , 19 , CIN85 ( a Cbl - binding protein that , through its interactions with endophilin , can induce membrane cur - vature ) 6 , and CD2AP ( a CIN85 - related protein that also binds Cbl and cortactin , thereby connecting the Cbl - mediated endocytosis to the actin polymerization , as cortactin is an activator of the Arp2 / 3 complex ) 20 . We examined the roles of these different components of the endocytic machinery in L . monocytogenes entry . We inhibited their expression by RNAi ( Fig . 5a ) , and tested how their absence affected the rate of L . monocytogenes invasion . As shown in Fig . 5b , cells with reduced levels of clathrin , eps15 , Grb2 , dynamin , CIN85 , CD2AP and cortactin , as well as cells with reduced levels of Hrs ( involved in late stages of endocytosis ) 21 , 22 were infected less efficiently by L . monocytogenes This indicated that the clathrin - dependent endocytic machinery is crucial in L . monocytogenes infection . Knocking down of expression of the clathrin adaptor complex AP - 2 did not affect the endocytosis of L . monocytogenes , which is in Met Actin 0 1 2 5 15 30 min a L . monocytogenes Met EEA1 Merged b Figure 2 Met localization during Listeria monocytogenes infection .

In conclusion , we show for the first time that a bacterium , which is 20 times larger than the maximum accepted size for an endocytic particle 25 , harnesses the clathrin - dependent endocytosis machinery to invade non - phagocytic mammalian cells .

What generates the force that is required for entry ? An attractive candidate is actin polymerization itself . As it has been well established in our laboratory , actin polymerization is absolutely necessary for L . monocytogenes invasion 2 . Actin polym - erization during InlB - mediated entry involves the Arp2 / 3 complex in conjunction with other proteins , including proteins of the WASP family 2 , 26 . Interestingly , actin and actin - binding proteins have a key role in yeast endocytosis , and recent studies have also pointed to an important role of the actin cytoskeleton in endocytosis in mam - malian cells 18 , 27 , 28 . Previous studies had already suggested a role for endocytosis in bacterial internalization 29 , 30 . Moreover , the relevance of clathrin in the uptake of large particles was already pointed out 20 years ago in a macrophage model in which latex beads were phago - cytosed in clathrin - coated vesicles 31 . Our results provide a molecular insight into such a mechanism . Whether the exploitation of the endocytic machinery is a general mech - anism that is used by bacteria to infect mammalian cells , and in other types of phagocytosis , is a possibility that we are currently investigating . METHODS Cells , bacteria and growth conditions . The human cell line used HeLa ( ATCC number CCL - 2 ) was grown as recommended by ATCC ( Manassas , VA ) .

Immunoprecipitation , re - immunoprecipitation and immunoblots were per - formed as previously described 4 . InlB purification was also performed as pre - viously described 33 . Cell - surface biotinylation and internalization assays were performed as described previously 13 , with some modifications . Briefly , cells were washed in ice - cold phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) , and incubated with 25 mg ml – 1 EZ - link Sulpho - NHS - SS - biotin ( Pierce ) for 15 min in PBS at pH 8 . 0 . This was followed by one wash with serum - free media containing 0 . 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) , followed by one wash in PBS containing Ca and Mg ( PBS + CaMg ; Gibco , Carlsbad , CA ) . Cells were then warmed to 37 °C , incu - bated with InlB for 2 min , and then cooled to 4 °C . Cells were washed again with PBS + CaMg , and cell - surface debiotinylation was performed by adding 100 mM MESNA in 50 mM Tris - HCl ( pH 8 . 6 ) , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA and 0 . 2 % BSA ( 3 times , 10 - min incubation ) . Cells were washed with PBS + CaMg , and residual MESNA was inactivated by a 10 - min incubation with 120 mM iodoacetamide in PBS .

HeLa cells were infected for 5 minutes with Listeria strain BUG 1641 . Extracellular bacteria were detected with anti - Listeria rabbit serum on non - permeabilized cells . Total bacteria were detected with the same anti - Listeria serum on permeabilized - triton - X100 treated - cells . Extracellular bacteria are shown in cyan , and intracellular bacteria in green . Endogenous clathrin was detected using mAb X - 22 anti - clathrin heavy chain ( Affinity BioReagents ) and is shown in red . 3D reconstructions were performed from 0 . 17 µ m confocal slice images using the Osirix program ; free download at ( http : / / homepage . mac . com / rossetantoine / osirix / ) . Note that clathrin surrounds internalizing bacteria . Movies 2 and 3 are magnifications of movie 1 . Movie 2 shows that clathrin completely surrounds a bacterium finishing its internalization process , whereas in movie 3 we can clearly appreciate clathrin wrapping the entry site of one bacteria starting its internalization process . © 2005 Nature Publishing Group
