Martin 1 , Matthew D . Welch 1 and David G . Drubin 1 , 2 The Arp2 / 3 complex , which is crucial for actin - based motility , nucleates actin filaments and organizes them into y - branched networks . The Arp2 subunit has been shown to hydrolyse ATP , but the functional importance of Arp2 / 3 ATP hydrolysis is not known . Here , we analysed an Arp2 mutant in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that is defective in ATP hydrolysis . Arp2 ATP hydrolysis and Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin nucleation occur almost simultaneously . However , ATP hydrolysis is not required for nucleation . In addition , Arp2 ATP hydrolysis is not required for the release of a WASP - like activator from y - branches . ATP hydrolysis by Arp2 , and possibly Arp3 , is essential for efficient y - branch dissociation in vitro . In living cells , both Arp2 and Arp3 ATP - hydrolysis mutants exhibit defects in endocytic internalization and actin - network disassembly . Our results suggest a critical feature of dendritic nucleation in which debranching and subsequent actin - filament remodelling and / or depolymerization are important for endocytic vesicle morphogenesis . Actin - filament assembly generates forces that support processes such as cell motility and endocytosis 1 , 2 . Cycles of actin assembly and disas - sembly are driven , in part , by the free energy derived from actin ATP hydrolysis . ATP - bound actin polymerizes into filaments and subse - quent ATP hydrolysis and release of inorganic phosphate ( P i ) destabi - lizes the filament , promoting depolymerization and recycling of actin subunits . As with actin , ATP binding by the Arp2 and Arp3 subunits of the Arp2 / 3 complex is critical for the function of this complex 3 – 6 . However , the function of ATP hydrolysis by the Arp2 / 3 complex is not clear . Arp2 hydrolyses ATP when a Wiscott - Aldrich syndrome protein ( WASP ) - family nucleation promoting factor ( NPF ) activates the Arp2 / 3 complex and promotes its association with the first actin monomer of the daughter filament 7 . However , depending on the experimental condi - tions , Arp2 ATP hydrolysis has been observed with half - lives ranging from 20 s ( similar to the rate of nucleation ) 7 to 800 s ( similar to the rate of y - branch dissociation ) 8 . Furthermore , studies using non - hydrolysable ATP analogues suggested that Arp2 / 3 ATP hydrolysis was essential for nucleation 3 , 4 , whereas studies using the ion Cr ( III ) , which is thought to delay Arp2 P i release following hydrolysis , suggested a role for Arp2 P i release during y - branch dissociation or debranching 8 . Although Arp3 has not been observed to hydrolyse ATP , residues predicted to cata - lyse ATP hydrolysis are conserved in Arp3 . Importantly , studies using non - hydrolysable ATP analogues and Cr ( III ) were unable to distinguish whether these molecules affect Arp2 , Arp3 or both . In addition , the relevance of Arp2 / 3 ATP hydrolysis to actin - based force generation in a biological context has not yet been determined . Ideally , Arp2 / 3 ATP hydrolysis mutants would be used to dissect the in vitro mechanism and in vivo function of Arp2 / 3 ATP hydrolysis . We previously generated 26 mutants that altered conserved residues in the nucleotide - binding pockets of S . cerevisiae Arp2 and Arp3 ( ref . 6 ) . Two Arp2 mutants were hypothesized to decrease ATP hydrolysis . Here , we focus on arp2 H161A as this mutant resulted in a growth defect ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1a ) , suggesting impaired Arp2 / 3 function . The homologous yeast actin histidine ( H161 ) is predicted to activate a water molecule for direct nucleophilic attack on the ATP γ - phosphate 9 . Growth of the corresponding Arp3 mutant , arp3 H161A , was indistinguishable from wild type . However , arp3 H161A was synthetic lethal with arp2 H161A ( data not shown ) , demonstrating that arp3 H161A also affects Arp2 / 3 complex function . The H161A mutant phenotypes were not due to reduced protein levels ( data not shown ) , altered Arp2 / 3 complex subunit composition ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1b ) or a defect in ATP binding ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1c ) . Analysis of Arp2 / 3 ATP hydrolysis during nucleation is complicated by the fact that actin , which is typically present at a 100 - fold molar excess relative to the Arp2 / 3 complex , hydrolyses ATP soon after polymeriza - tion 1 , 2 . Therefore , an experimental strategy must be used to distinguish between actin , Arp2 and Arp3 ATP hydrolysis . We used an approach in which purified Arp2 / 3 complex containing Arp2 and Arp3 cova - lently bound to γ - 32 P - ATP was used to individually monitor Arp2 and Arp3 γ - phosphate cleavage 7 , 8 . Yeast Arp2 and Arp3 failed to hydrolyse ATP in the absence of either actin or a WASP - like NPF , Las17p ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S1d ) . However , the addition of actin and Las17p together resulted in an approximately 50 % decrease in the Arp2 32 P - signal over 2 min ( Fig . 1a , c ) . Although a decrease in the Arp3 32 P - signal was not observed , the possibility that crosslinking inactivates 1 16 Barker Hall , Dept . of Molecular and Cell Biology , University of California Berkeley , CA 94720 - 3202 , USA . 2 Correspondence should be addressed to D .

In contrast with wild - type Arp2 , Arp2 H161A significantly impaired ATP hydrolysis , as indicated by the absence of Arp2 H161A γ - phosphate cleavage over 8 min ( Fig . 1b , c ) . Interestingly , Arp2 from the Arp3 H161A - mutant complex hydrolysed higher levels of ATP ( Fig . 1b , c ) . These data suggested that Arp2 H161A blocks Arp2 ATP hydroly - sis activity . Alternatively , Arp2 H161A could impair Arp2 / 3 - mediated nucleation , preventing stimulation of Arp2 ATP hydrolysis . To distin - guish between these possibilities , the nucleation activities of Arp2 / 3 complexes containing either Arp2 H161A or Arp3 H161A were examined by monitoring pyrene – actin assembly . Arp2 H161A and Arp3 H161A increased Arp2 / 3 complex nucleation activity compared with wild type , in both the presence and absence of Las17p ( Fig . 1d and see Supplementary Information , Fig . S2a ) . Furthermore , wild - type and H161A mutant com - plexes bound to the Arp2 / 3 - binding WCA ( WASP homology 2 , connec - tor or central , acidic ) domain of Las17p with indistinguishable affinity ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S2b ) . Therefore , the enhanced nucleation activity of these complexes possibly reflects conformational changes that mimic activation , similar to Arp2 Y306A ( ref . 6 ) . To relate ATP hydrolysis to nucleation activity , free barbed - end concentrations nucle - ated by the Arp2 / 3 complex were compared with the amount of Arp2 ATP hydrolysis at different times . Arp2 ATP hydrolysis exhibited a 1 : 1 correlation with the number of nucleation events for both wild - type and Arp3 H161A complexes ( Fig . 1e ) . Thus , the increase in Arp2 ATP hydrolysis observed for Arp3 H161A resulted from its higher nucleation activity . Arp2 ATP hydrolysis occurred within 20 s of nucleation for both wild - type and Arp3 H161A Arp2 / 3 complexes . In contrast , Arp2 H161A did not hydro - lyse ATP , despite efficient nucleation by this Arp2 / 3 mutant ( Fig . 1e ) . Therefore , Arp2 H161A impairs ATP hydrolysis , uncoupling this activity from nucleation . This finding demonstrates that Arp2 ATP hydrolysis is not required for Arp2 / 3 - complex nucleation activity . In budding yeast , the Arp2 / 3 complex is required for endocytic internalization 6 , 10 . Therefore , to determine whether ATP hydrolysis is required for Arp2 / 3 function in vivo , endocytosis of the fluid - phase dye , Lucifer yellow , was examined by fluorescence microscopy .

The arp3 H161A mutant showed an intermediate defect in Lucifer yellow uptake , further indicating that both of these mutants affect Arp2 / 3 complex function ( Fig . 2a , b ) . Actin and the Arp2 / 3 complex colocalize in budding yeast at dynamic cortical actin patches 11 , 12 , which are endocytic sites 13 – 17 . Actin - patch assembly and internalization coincide with the slow inward movement of clathrin and endocytic adaptor proteins such as Sla1p 13 , 14 , 16 . Inward movement of Sla1p may reflect the invagination step of clathrin - coated vesicle formation and is driven by Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin polymeriza - tion 6 , 13 , 14 . We therefore examined Sla1 – GFP movement in the H161A mutants . The arp2 H161A mutant exhibited a threefold increase in Sla1 – GFP cortical lifetime and a 70 % reduction in the frequency of Sla1 – GFP inward movements ( Fig . 2c – e and see Supplementary Information , Movie 1 ) , demonstrating that Arp2 ATP hydrolysis is crucial for endo - cytic internalization . The arp3 H161A mutant had a minor Sla1 – GFP internalization defect ( Fig . 2c – e and see Supplementary Information , Movie 1 ) . Deletion of a negative regulator of Arp2 / 3 - mediated nuclea - tion , Bbc1p 18 , has been shown to increase the speed and distance of Sla1 – GFP movement 14 . Therefore , Sla1 – GFP movement was examined in the bbc1∆ background to accentuate differences between wild - type and arp2 H161A cells . In arp H161A - bbc1∆ cells , 70 % of Sla1 – GFP patches failed to internalize ( Fig . 2e , f and see Supplementary Information , Movie 2 ) . In addition , Sla1 – GFP patches that were internalized in arp H161A - bbc1∆ cells moved discontinuously , often pausing below the plasma membrane before continuing into the cytoplasm ( Fig . 2f ) . This phenotype possibly indicated a secondary defect in vesicle scission and / or actin network release from the plasma membrane . Overall , these results demonstrate that Arp2 ATP hydrolysis is important for Arp2 / 3 - mediated force generation in vivo , possibly functioning at multiple steps of endocytic vesicle formation . To determine whether the arp2 H161A mutant affects actin assembly and / or disassembly at endocytic sites , endocytic actin dynamics were examined using Sac6p ( yeast fimbrin ) , a marker for filamentous actin . In wild - type cells , Sac6p assembles at immotile Sla1p patches and the two proteins co - internalize 14 . The arp2 H161A mutant exhibited an 80 % reduction in the frequency of Sac6 – GFP internalization and the ‘lifetime’ of Sac6 – GFP was threefold longer compared with wild - type cells ( data not shown ) , consistent with its endocytic defect . Interestingly , arp2 H161A and arp3 H161A only slightly decreased the rate of Sac6p assembly at Sla1 – GFP - containing patches ( Fig . 3a , b and see Supplementary Information , Movie 3 ) .

In addition , internalized Sac6 – GFP patches in arp2 H161A cells persisted in the cytoplasm for 12 . 6 ± 9 . 6 s ( n = 20 ) , compared with 4 . 0 ± 1 . 4 s ( n = 20 ) in wild - type cells , before disassembling or moving out of the focal plane ( Fig . 3c and see Supplementary Information , Movie 4 ) . Sac6 – GFP patches in the arp2 H161A mutant were sometimes seen to fuse , resulting in mobile cytoplasmic clumps with lifetimes > 60 s ( see Supplementary Information , Movie 5 ) . It is most likely that the prolonged Sac6p lifetime resulted from an actin disassembly defect , rather than continued actin nucleation , because the plasma membrane associated NPFs , Las17p and Myo5p , remained associated with the plasma mem - brane during internalization ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S3a ) , and neither Las17p , Myo5p nor the NPF Pan1p localized to the long - lived Sac6 – GFP - containing structures ( data not shown ) . Furthermore , both arp2 H161A and arp3 H161A mutant actin patches and cell growth showed elevated resistance to the actin monomer - sequestering drug , latrunculin A ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S3b – d ) . Therefore , in addition to affecting endocytic internalization , both the Arp2 and Arp3 ATP hydrolysis mutants impede actin network disassembly . As wild - type actin patches are smaller than the limits of resolution for light microscopy , mutants with exaggerated cortical actin struc - tures are valuable tools for examining actin network organization and dynamics at yeast endocytic sites 6 , 13 , 14 . The sla2∆ mutant blocks endo - cytosis and causes the formation of elongated actin tails in which actin subunits continuously flow from an endocytic complex at the plasma membrane into the cytoplasm 13 . Phenotypic analysis of this mutant , and others , suggested that actin nucleation occurs near the plasma membrane and that retrograde movement of actin filaments tethered to endocytic coat proteins drives endocytic internalization 13 , 14 .

Despite increasing nucleation activ - ity in vitro , the arp2 H161A mutant suppressed actin tail formation in the sla2∆ mutant . Actin structures formed , but did not efficiently extend away from the plasma membrane in arp2 H161A - sla2∆ cells ( Fig . 3d and see Supplementary Information , Movie 6 ) . Other Arp2 / 3 mutants , includ - ing arp3 H161A ( Fig . 3d ) , arp3 G302Y ( ref . 6 ) , arp3 D11A and arp2 D11A ( data not shown ) , formed elongated actin tails when combined with sla2 ∆ . Therefore , arp2 H161A specifically impairs actin - network retrograde flow at endocytic sites . Arp2 ATP hydrolysis may facilitate actin network disassembly in vivo by promoting y - branch dissociation 8 . To determine whether arp2 H161A affects y - branch stability , actin filaments from nucleation reactions were fixed with rhodamine – phalloidin at different times and visualized using fluorescence microscopy 8 , 19 . Y - branches nucleated by wild - type yeast Arp2 / 3 complex dissociated with a half - life of 27 min ( Fig . 4a ) 8 , 19 . This debranching rate was approximately 100 - fold slower than the rate of Arp2 ATP hydrolysis . Despite this difference in rates , Arp2 H161A sta - bilized y - branches nucleated by the Arp2 / 3 complex , increasing their half - life to 126 min ( Fig . 4a ) . Interestingly , Arp3 H161A also stabilized y - branches , suggesting the possibility that Arp3 might hydrolyse ATP ( Fig . 4a ) . Increased branch stability was correlated with the in vivo effects of these mutants on endocytosis and actin disassembly ( Fig . 2b ) . Because the in vitro debranching rate is > 100 - fold longer than actin - patch life - time , it is likely that proteins such as cofilin accelerate debranching in cells 19 . Both arp2 H161A and arp3 H161A were synthetic lethal with cof1 - 22 , a temperature sensitive cofilin mutant 20 ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S3e and Table S1 ) . In addition , arp2 H161A was synthetic lethal with the aip1∆ mutant ( see Supplementary Information , Table S1 ) , which encodes a protein that interacts with cofilin to induce actin - filament disassembly 21 . Thus , Arp2 / 3 ATP hydrolysis and cofilin may cooperate to disassemble the actin meshwork . It has been suggested that membrane - bound NPFs release Arp2 / 3 - containing y - branches , thus allowing actin - filament elongation adja - cent to a surface 22 , 23 . Impaired NPF release may stabilize y - branches in vitro and cause endocytic defects in vivo . Therefore , we directly visualized NPF release in vitro by immobilizing Alexa - 568 - labelled Las17p ( Alexa - 568 – Las17p ) on the surface of a coverslip and then observing actin polymerization using total internal reflection fluores - cence ( TIRF ) microscopy ( Fig . 4b and see Supplementary Information , Fig . S4a , b ) . Y - branches formed in association with Alexa - 568 – Las17p and were released from Alexa - 568 – Las17p within 20 s of the nuclea - tion event , exhibiting an off rate of approximately 0 . 06 s ( Fig . 4c and see Supplementary Information , Movie 7 ) .

Importantly , Las17p released Arp2 H161A and Arp3 H161A y - branches simi - larly to wild type ( Fig . 4c and see Supplementary Information , Fig . S4c and Movie 8 ) . Thus , Arp2 H161A and Arp3 H161A branch stabilization is not due to failed NPF release . Because Arp2 H161A and Arp3 H161A stabilized y - branches in vitro , their mutant phenotypes may result from a debranching defect , rather than an actin nucleation defect . If this hypothesis is true , then arp2 H161A genetic interactions should be distinct from those of the nucleation defective arp3 G302Y mutant 6 . Two mutants , las17 – Δ A and pan1 - KE101 , encode NPFs defective in Arp2 / 3 binding 25 , 26 and are synthetic sick or lethal with arp3 G302Y ( ref . 6 ) . In contrast , arp2 H161A growth was partially sup - pressed by las17 – Δ A and pan1 - KE101 ( Table 1 and see Supplementary Information , Fig . S5a ) . NPF mutants possibly suppress arp2 H161A by lowering the number of hyper - stable y - branches nucleated at endocytic sites . Furthermore , both H161A mutants exhibited synthetic sickness or lethality with the Y ( F ) 306A class of Arp2 / 3 mutants ( Table 1 and see Supplementary Information , Fig . S5b ) , which increase nucleation activ - ity in vitro and suppress growth defects of nucleation - defective mutants 6 . Therefore , arp2 H161A and arp3 H161A do not impair endocytosis by reducing actin nucleation at endocytic sites . A summary of Arp2 / 3 hydrolysis mutant effects is presented in the Supplementary Information , Table S2 . Previous studies suggested that Arp2 ATP hydrolysis is critical for actin nucleation 3 , 4 . Here , we used the arp2 H161A mutant to demonstrate that Arp2 ATP hydrolysis is not required for nucleation or NPF release , but is essential for efficient y - branch dissociation . The arp3 H161A mutant also delayed debranching in vitro and exhibited actin - disassembly defects in vivo . This result was unexpected because Arp3 ATP hydrolysis was not observed in vitro 7 , 8 . We speculate that the arp3 H161A phenotype results from a defect in Arp3 ATP hydrolysis , which may also promote debranching . Because ATP crosslinking may inactivate the ATP - hydrolysis activity of Arp3 , new techniques are required to fully assess this activity . Arp2 and Arp3 have been shown to associate with the daughter - filament pointed end in y - branches , with Arp2 making the majority of contacts 24 , 27 . We propose that Arp2 / 3 ATP hydrolysis , predominantly by Arp2 , mediates release of the daughter - filament pointed end , allowing actin filament reorganiza - tion and depolymerization ( Fig . 5 ) . Arp2 ATP hydrolysis occurs within 20 s of nucleation , > 100 - fold faster than the debranching rate . Other factors , such as ADF – cofilin and / or mechanical load , are likely to cooperate with Arp2 / 3 ATP hydrolysis to accelerate debranching in vivo . The ADF – cofilin protein actophorin greatly accelerates debranching in vitro 19 , possibly by increasing the rate of P i release from actin filaments 28 . Our data suggest that Arp2 / 3 ATP hydrolysis and cofilin may cooperate to facilitate actin - network disassembly in cells . Importantly , the arp2 H161A single mutant delays actin - network disassembly , suggesting that cofilin - mediated actin - fila - ment disassembly may require debranching . Arp2 / 3 ATP hydrolysis is crucial for endocytic internalization . Suppression of arp2 H161A phenotypes by NPF loss - of - function mutants suggests that the arp2 H161A phenotype is not due to impaired actin nucleation that results indirectly from reduced actin turnover . This genetic interaction also suggests that the increased nucleation activity of arp2 H161A and arp3 H161A could enhance their mutant phenotypes . However , increased nucleation activity alone cannot explain the observed defects , because a mutant that similarly increases nucleation activity ( arp2 Y306A ) has no endocytic defect 6 or synthetic phenotype with cof1 - 22 ( data not shown ) . Therefore , debranching seems to be a distinct Arp2 / 3 complex activity that is required for endocytic internalization . We propose that debranch - ing and subsequent actin network remodelling are required to accom - modate the changing geometry of a budding endocytic vesicle ( Fig . 5 ) . In addition , remodelling may release endocytic vesicles and actin from the plasma membrane after scission . Endocytic proteins , such as mam - malian cortactin , possibly regulate branch stability during endocytic internalization 29 . It is likely that the arp2 H161A mutant interferes with the spatial – temporal regulation of branch stability , resulting in an intractable actin network that presents a barrier to endocytic - coat and actin - network internalization ( Fig . 5 ) . Consistent with this hypothesis , arp2 H161A sup - pressed the actin - tail phenotype in sla2∆ cells , impeding actin - filament retrograde movement at endocytic sites . In summary , y - branch dynamics are a critical feature of actin networks that need to be explored to fully understand the functions of actin in endocytosis and cell motility . METHODS Yeast strains and media . The yeast strains used in this study are listed in the Supplementary Information , Table S3 . Arp2 / 3 mutants and GFP / RFP tagged proteins were generated as previously described 6 , 14 . All strains were grown in rich media at 25 °C unless otherwise noted . ATP hydrolysis and nucleation assays . Yeast Arp2 / 3 complex , Las17p and rabbit skeletal muscle actin were purified as previously described 6 , 18 . Arp2 / 3 complex ( 1 µM ) in KMEI buffer ( 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM EGTA , 10 mM imida - zole at pH 7 . 0 ) was equilibrated with 8 - azido - γ - 32 P - ATP ( 6 µM ; Affinity Labeling Technologies , Inc . , Lexington , KY ) for 2 min and irradiated with 254 nm UV light for 10 s using a hand - held Mineralight lamp . The crosslinking reaction was stopped with 1 mM ATP and 1 mM DTT . γ - 32 P - ATP - labelled Arp2 / 3 complex ( 10 nM ) was mixed with actin ( 2 µM ) and polymerization buffer ( final concen - tration : 50 mM KCl , 1 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM EGTA ) . An aliquot was removed for the 0 min time point and Las17p was then added ( 50 nM ) to initiate the reac - tion . Aliquots ( 400 µl ) were removed at different times and mixed with 80 % methanol : 20 % chloroform ( 500 µl ) to precipitate the proteins . Samples were subjected to SDS – PAGE and analysed using a Typhoon 9400 Phosphoimager ( GE Healthcare , Piscataway , NJ ) . To measure Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin assembly , pyrene fluorescence was moni - tored . Actin ( 2 µM , 5 % pyrene - labelled ) was mixed with the indicated proteins Table 1 The arp2 H161A and arp3 H161A mutant phenotypes are not due to reduced actin nucleation arp3 G302Y ( ts , ss , fs ) arp2 H161A ( ss , fs ) arp3 H161A ( WT ) las17 - ∆ A ( WT ) Synthetic lethal Suppression No effect pan1 - KE101 ( WT ) Synthetic sick Suppression Not determined arp2 Y306A ( WT ) Suppression Synthetic sick / synthetic lethal arp3 F306A ( WT ) Synthetic sick / synthetic lethal The H161A mutants are distinct from mutants that decrease Arp2 / 3 - complex nucleation activity . Synthetic phenotypes of double - mutant combinations between Arp2 and Arp3 mutants , and Arp2 / 3 and NPF mutants are shown . Genetic interactions were examined by analysing at least 12 tetrads from each cross and identifying double mutants using linked auxotrophic markers . The phenotypes of the starting single - mutant strains are indicated in brackets . A synthetic - lethal phenotype indicates that the resulting double - mutant spores were unable to grow at 25 °C .

Fluorescence data were collected using a Fluoromax 3 fluorometer ( Jobin - Yvon Horiba , Edison , NJ ) . To relate nucleation activity to Arp2 ATP hydrolysis ( Fig . 1e ) , identical rea - gents were used ( with the exception of γ - 32 P - ATP - labelled Arp2 / 3 ) to perform both the actin assembly and ATP hydrolysis assays . Free barbed - end concen - trations nucleated by the Arp2 / 3 complex were calculated by first fitting the experimental data to a model of autocatalytic actin assembly 30 and then calculating barbed - end concentrations using a rate constant of 8 . 7 µM – 1 s – 1 , as pre - viously described 6 . To calculate the concentrations of ATP hydrolysed , the initial γ - 32 P - ATP - labelled Arp2 intensity was scaled to the total amount of Arp2 / 3 com - plex ( 10 nM ) . The amount of Arp2 hydrolysis was determined by the decrease in the 32 P signal ( Fig . 1c ) . 8 - azido - ATP crosslinking did not affect Arp2 / 3 complex nucleation ( data not shown ) . We assumed that non - crosslinked Arp2 hydrolyses ATP at the same rate as crosslinked ATP . Microscopy . For live - cell imaging , strains were grown at 25 °C to A 60 = 0 . 1 – 0 . 5 in minimal media lacking tryptophan ( SD – Trp ) and adhered to the surface of a Con A - coated coverslip . To create a chamber , a coverslip was inverted onto a glass slide containing a square outline of vacuum grease and the sample was imaged at room temperature . Single - colour movies were obtained using an Olympus IX - 81 micro - scope , 100 × NA 1 . 4 objective and an Orca - ER camera ( Hamamatsu , Hamamatsu City , Japan ) . Two - colour movies were obtained by switching between RFP and GFP filter sets . All image processing was performed using ImageJ ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / ) as previously described 13 . Debranching assay . Actin ( 2 µM , 5 % pyrene - labelled ) was polymerized with Arp2 / 3 complex ( 50 nM ) and Las17p WCA ( 500 nM ) . To compensate for the higher nucleation activity of the H161A mutants , a fivefold lower concentra - tion of Arp2 / 3 complex ( 10 nM ) was used to ensure that the nucleation activ - ity and starting - branch density was equivalent to that of 50 nM wild - type Arp2 / 3 complex . Aliquots were removed at different times and stabilized with rhodamine – phalloidin to visualize actin filaments . The first time point was taken after steady - state levels of actin polymer were reached . Rhodamine – phalloidin - stabilized actin filaments were processed for imaging as previously described 6 . Branch density was calculated by counting branches manually and then using Fovea Pro 3 . 0 ( Reindeer Graphics , Inc . , Asheville , NC ) for Adobe Photoshop 7 . 0 ( Adobe Systems , Inc . , San Jose , CA ) to calculate total filament length . At least 8 , 000 µm of filaments were analysed for each time point . NPF release assay . Monomeric actin was labelled at 4 °C for 4 h with a fivefold excess of Alexa - 488 – maleimide ( GE Healthcare ) . DTT ( 2 mM ) was added to stop the reaction and Alexa - 488 - labelled actin was gel filtered using a Superose 6 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) column to remove free dye . Las17p was dialysed into HE buffer ( 20 mM HEPES at pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM EDTA ) containing 0 . 5 M KCl ( to prevent Las17p aggregation ) and labelled for 12 h at 4 °C with Alexa - 568 – male - imide ( Molecular Probes ) . Although actin that copurified with Las17p was also labelled with Alexa - 568 ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S4a ) , it was unlikely to interfere with NPF - release measurements because actin alone is unable to form y - branches and Alexa - 488 – actin was present in > 1 , 000 - fold excess in the NPF - release assay . Alexa - 568 – Las17p alone adhered to glass coverslips . Therefore , to immobilize Las17p on the coverslip surface , Alexa - 568 – Las17p ( 0 . 5 nM ) was incubated for 5 min in a flow chamber created using two pieces of double sided tape as spacers between a glass slide and a coverslip . Buffer was flowed through the chamber to remove unbound Alexa - 568 – Las17p and free dye . The chamber was subsequently blocked with 0 . 5 % BSA . Alexa - 568 – Las17p single molecules ( see Supplementary Information , Fig . S4b ) or clusters could be detected by epifluo - rescence microscopy . Actin polymerization was initiated by adding actin ( 2 µM , 35 % Alexa - 488 - labelled ) and Arp2 / 3 complex ( 1 – 10 nM ) to the flow chamber . The final reaction buffer was KMEI containing 3 mg ml – 1 glucose , 0 . 1 mg ml – 1 glu - cose oxidase , 20 µg ml – 1 catalase , 10 mM DTT and 0 . 25 % methylcellulose . Alexa - 488 – actin and Alexa - 568 – Las17p were imaged by alternating between TIRF and epifluorescence microscopy using an Olympus IX - 81 microscope equipped with a Endocytic coat Las17p – WASP Actin Arp2 / 3 ( ATP ) Arp2 / 3 ( ADP ) Arp2 H161A D T T T Arp2Arp2 Arp3Arp3Arp3Arp3 Nucleation 0 s 0 s 15 s 15 s 50 s 50 s D D NPF release D D Debranching Figure 5 Schematic representation of a model for Arp2 / 3 complex ATP hydrolysis function . Las17p and other NPFs activate the Arp2 / 3 complex at endocytic sites , generating actin y - branches . Y - branches are released from membrane - bound NPFs and Arp2 ATP hydrolysis destabilizes the branch . Other proteins , such as cofilin , may accelerate branch dissociation or debranching . Debranching allows actin network remodelling around the emerging endocytic vesicle and eventual actin - network disassembly . In the arp2 H161A mutant , branches are stabilized , preventing y - branch reorganization and endocytic internalization . © 200 6 Nature Publishing Group NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 8 | NUMBER 8 | AUGUST 2006 833 L E T T E R S 100 × NA 1 . 45 objective . An argon - ion laser ( Melles Griot , Carlsbad , CA ) directed through the objective was used for TIRF microscopy . The observed interaction between Alexa - 568 – Las17p and y - branches was specific because y - branch forma - tion was Arp2 / 3 - and Las17p - dependent , and the addition of a tenfold excess of unlabelled Las17p to the reaction reduced the frequency of y - branches associated with Alexa - 568 – Las17p from 86 % ( n = 57 ) to 17 % ( n = 53 ) .

The H161A mutants exhibit specific synthetic lethal interactions with the cof1 - 22 and aip1∆ mutants . cof1 - 22 [ ts , ss , fs ] aip1∆ [ WT ] arp2 - H161A [ ss , fs ] synthetic lethal synthetic lethal arp3 - H161A [ WT ] synthetic lethal synthetic sick ts ( 34°C ) , ss , fs arp3 - G302Y [ ts , ss , fs ] synthetic sick ts ( 34°C ) no interaction arp3 - D11A [ ts , ss , fs ] synthetic sick ts ( 34°C ) Synthetic phenotypes of double mutant combinations are indicated . Note that synthetic lethality with cof1 - 22 is specific to the H161A mutants because two mutants that severely impair endocytosis , arp3 - G302Y and arp3 - D11A , only mildly enhance the cof1 - 22 growth phenotype . Genetic interactions were examined by analyzing at least 10 tetrads from each cross and identifying double mutants using linked auxotrophic markers . The phenotypes of the single mutant strains are shown in brackets . A synthetic lethal phenotype means that double mutant spores were unable to grow at 25°C . A synthetic sick phenotype means that double mutants grew less well than either single mutant , resulting in the indicated growth phenotype .

Arp2 ATP hydrolysis : The concentration of Arp2 that hydrolyzed ATP in a nucleation reaction containing 10 nM Arp2 / 3 complex ( Fig . 1c and e ) . Nucleation activity : The concentration of barbed ends nucleated by Arp2 / 3 complex in a reaction equivalent to that used to measure Arp2 ATP hydrolysis ( Fig . 1e ) . NPF release : half - life of NPF release . Debranching : half - life ( top ) and plateau ( bottom ) of the fitted debranching curve . Note that arp3 - H161A has a longer half - life because it has a lower plateau than either wild - type or arp2 - H161A . Lucifer yellow internalization : Percentage of cells exhibiting Lucifer yellow staining ( Fig . 2b ) . Sla1p internalization : The percentage of Sla1 - GFP patches that exhibited inward movement ( Fig . 2e ) . Actin disassembly : the average length of Sac6 - GFP persistence after internalization . Note that arp3 - H161A is also synthetic lethal with cof1 - 22 and has slower rates of Latrunculin A - induced actin patch disassembly , leading to the + / - designation . sla2 ∆ tail formation : scored for the presence or absence of stable elongated actin tails . © 200 6 Nature Publishing Group Table S3 .
