Introduction Phosphatidylinositol ( PI ) 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) and PI 3 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate ( PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) are two phosphoinositides concentrated at the plasma membrane that play major regu - latory roles in a variety of cellular functions . Their levels are tightly controlled by kinases , phosphatases , and phospholipases ( Di Paolo and De Camilli , 2006 ; Vicinanza et al . , 2008 ) . Some phosphatases not only control cell surface – associated levels of these phosphoinositides but also couple endocytosis to their dephosphorylation , thus ensuring their preferential or selective retention at the plasma membrane . More specifically , synapto - janin 1 and 2 , as well as OCRL ( oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe ) and INPP5B , all contain an inositol 5 - phosphatase domain , bind endocytic proteins , and are found at early stages of the endocytic pathway ( McPherson et al . , 1996 ; Shin et al . , 2005 ; Hyvola et al . , 2006 ; Perera et al . , 2006 ; Erdmann et al . , 2007 ) . Additionally , synaptojanin 1 and OCRL , which contain binding sites for clathrin’s heavy chain and its adaptor AP - 2 , are recruited to endocytic clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ; Perera et al . , 2006 ; Erdmann et al . , 2007 ; Choudhury et al . , 2009 ; Mao et al . , 2009 ) . Studies of these enzymes , as well as evidence for the critical role of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the recruitment to the plasma mem - brane of endocytic clathrin adaptors and their accessory factors , led to the now well - established concept that PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 plays an important role in CCP dynamics ( Cremona et al . , 1999 ; Haucke , 2005 ; Di Paolo and De Camilli , 2006 ; Zoncu et al . , 2007 ) in ad - dition to its classical signaling roles . Endocytic clathrin adaptors also bind PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( Hao et al . , 1997 ; Rapoport et al . , 1997 ; Gaidarov and Keen , 1999 ; Itoh et al . , 2001 ) , an important mediator of the actions of insulin and other growth factors . Furthermore , inositol 5 - phosphatases known to be located at endocytic CCPs , namely synaptojanin P hosphatidylinositol ( PI ) 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) and its phosphorylated product PI 3 , 4 , 5 - triphosphate ( PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ) are two major phosphoinositides con - centrated at the plasma membrane . Their levels , which are tightly controlled by kinases , phospholipases , and phosphatases , regulate a variety of cellular functions , in - cluding clathrin - mediated endocytosis and receptor sig - naling . In this study , we show that the inositol 5 - phosphatase SHIP2 , a negative regulator of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - dependent sig - naling , also negatively regulates PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels and is concentrated at endocytic clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) via interactions with the scaffold protein intersectin . SHIP2 is recruited early at the pits and dissociates before fission . Both knockdown of SHIP2 expression and acute produc - tion of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 shorten CCP lifetime by enhancing the rate of pit maturation , which is consistent with a positive role of both SHIP2 substrates , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , on coat assembly . Because SHIP2 is a negative regulator of insulin signaling , our findings suggest the importance of the phosphoinositide metabolism at CCPs in the regula - tion of insulin signal output .

Clathrin spots , shown previously to represent individual CCPs ( Gaidarov et al . , 1999 ; Zoncu et al . , 2007 ) , formed continuously at the plasma membrane and abruptly disappeared as the result of fission and internalization . Their cumulative surface lifetimes were 1 – 2 min ( Fig . 1 , C and D ) , as we and others previously reported ( Gaidarov et al . , 1999 ; Perera et al . , 2006 ) . GFP - SHIP2 signal increased in parallel with clathrin - mRFP fluorescence but plateaued earlier than clathrin and dis - appeared slightly before clathrin ( Fig . 1 , C and D ; and Video 1 ) . Comparison of the dynamics of GFP - SHIP2 relative to cortactin - DsRed , which visits late - stage CCPs together with dynamin just before fission ( Merrifield et al . , 2005 ) , revealed that cortactin appeared just as SHIP2 disappeared ( Fig . 1 E ) , confirming that SHIP2 leaves CCPs before fission . Collectively , these results demonstrate that SHIP2 is a component of early - stage CCPs . The localization of SHIP2 at CCPs is mediated by its proline - rich region The catalytic domain of SHIP2 ( see domain structure in Fig . 2 A ) is flanked at the C - terminal side by a proline - rich region followed by a SAM ( sterile  motif ) domain ( Ooms et al . , 2009 ) . Deletion of the SAM domain did not affect CCP localization ( Fig . S1 C ) . However , a SHIP2 construct lacking the proline - rich region no longer localized to CCPs ( Fig . 2 B ) . This construct localized instead to focal adhesions , as verified by colocalization with the tip of actin stress fibers ( Fig . 2 C ) , and Mena , a focal adhesion protein ( Fig . S2 D ; Krause et al . , 2003 ) . Thus , SHIP2 is recruited to CCPs through its proline - rich region , and when the targeting signal present in this domain is missing , another targeting sig - nal that directs the protein to focal adhesion predominates . The small fraction of cells that normally exhibit preferential focal adhesion localization of full - length SHIP2 may reflect a differ - ent functional state of these cells and suggests that the balance and OCRL ( Perera et al . , 2006 ; Erdmann et al . , 2007 ; Mao et al . , 2009 ) , can act on PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 in addition to PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Woscholski et al . , 1997 ; Zhang et al . , 1998 ; Ooms et al . , 2009 ) . Thus , PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 may contribute to clathrin coat dynamics be - sides having a role in signaling . Based on these considerations , we have investigated whether SHIP2 , a broadly expressed inositol 5 - phosphatase whose preferred substrate is PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 but can also act on PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Hejna et al . , 1995 ; Taylor et al . , 2000 ) , has a role at endocytic CCPs . Results and discussion SHIP2 is localized at endocytic CCPs Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( TIRFM ) of COS - 7 cells cotransfected with GFP - SHIP2 and with an mRFP fusion of the clathrin light chain ( clathrin - mRFP ) revealed that in > 95 % of cells expressing GFP - SHIP2 at low levels , this pro - tein appeared in small diffraction - limited spots that overlapped with clathrin puncta ( Figs . 1 A and 2 A ; Gaidarov et al . , 1999 ) . Accordingly , SHIP2 also colocalized with mRFP - tagged epsin , an endocytic clathrin adaptor ( Fig . 1 B ; Chen et al . , 1998 ) . More than 80 % of endocytic CCPs were positive for SHIP2 . Only in a minority of cells was SHIP2 localized instead to focal adhesions , which is consistent with the known interaction of SHIP2 with focal adhesion proteins such as p130 CAS and filamin ( Dyson et al . , 2001 ; Prasad et al . , 2001 ) . Both CCP and focal adhesion localizations of GFP - SHIP2 were observed in cells expressing higher levels of the protein . The presence of GFP - SHIP2 at CCPs was observed in all cells examined ( C2C12 , PtK2 , mouse fibroblasts , and pri - mary astrocytes ; Fig . S1 A ) , whereas the highly homologous 5 - phosphatase SHIP1 did not localize to CCPs ( not depicted ) . The dynamics of SHIP2 at CCPs were analyzed by TIRFM in COS - 7 cells expressing low levels of GFP - SHIP2 and Figure 1 . Localization of SHIP2 at CCPs .

Because intersectin 1 is a scaffold adaptor protein concen - trated at CCPs ( McPherson , 2002 ) , its role in subcellular target - ing of SHIP2 was investigated by TIRFM . In COS - 7 cells , both GFP – intersectin 1 – L and – S colocalized with clathrin - mRFP as expected ( Fig . S2 , A and B ) . SHIP2 also colocalized at these puncta ( Fig . S2 C ) . However , when levels of intersectin 1 were reduced by  90 % via siRNA - mediated knockdown ( KD ; Fig . 2 I ) , SHIP2 localization at CCPs was no longer observed ( Fig . 2 J ) , although the clathrin signal itself remained robust . Under these conditions , SHIP2 had a mainly diffuse localiza - tion with some accumulation at focal adhesions . Because local - ization of intersectin 1 at CCPs was not perturbed in SHIP2 KD between these two types of SHIP2 localizations may be regulated . Analysis of additional SHIP2 truncation mutants mapped the CCP localization signal to aa 1022 – 1078 ( Fig . 2 D and Fig . S2 E ) . This region does not include known clathrin or clathrin adaptor binding motifs . Binding of a polyproline motif of SHIP2 to intersectin is responsible for CCP localization To identify protein interactors of the aa 1022 – 1078 region of SHIP2 that may be responsible for CCP localization , pull - down experiments from a rat brain cytosolic extract were performed . SDS - PAGE analysis of the material specifically affinity puri - fied by GST – SHIP2 - 1022 – 1078 revealed  190 - and  150 - kD bands , which mass spectrometry identified as the long ( L ) and short ( S ) forms of intersectin 1 ( Fig . 2 G ) .

A physiological and major role of SHIP2 in the control of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels was supported by the finding that the PI bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) / PI phosphate ( PIP ) ratio in SHIP2 KD cells was  40 % higher than in control cells ( Fig . 3 I ) . Thus , a potential explanation for the faster growth of endocytic CCPs in SHIP2 KD cells is that higher levels of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 promote a faster recruitment of the endocytic clathrin adaptors and their accessory proteins ( Fig . 3 , C – G ) . Clathrin adaptors can also bind PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( Gaidarov et al . , 1996 ; Hao et al . , 1997 ; Rapoport et al . , 1997 ; Gaidarov and Keen , 1999 ; Itoh et al . , 2001 ; Collins et al . , 2002 ) . How - ever , PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 levels were at the limit of detectability in both control and SHIP2 KD cells kept in normal serum - containing medium , unless cells were subjected to acute serum stimulation after serum deprivation . Under such conditions , a PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 peak was readily detected , and its levels were  20 % higher in SHIP2 KD cells ( Fig . 4 A ) . Thus , global changes in PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 levels are unlikely to account for changes in the dynamics of CCPs under our standard culture conditions . It remains possible that local pools of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 generated by PI 3 - kinases local - ized at CCPs may play a role in CCP dynamics and that im - paired dephosphorylation of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 may contribute to the accelerated maturation of CCPs observed in SHIP2 KD cells . Type I PI 3 - kinases are expected to be localized at endocytic CCPs that mediate the internalization of growth factor receptors ( Cantley , 2002 ; Engelman et al . , 2006 ) . Furthermore , studies of type II PI 3 - kinases  and  ( PI3KC2 -  and PI3KC2 -  ) have revealed links of these enzymes to CCPs . More specifically , ( a ) both PI3KC2 -  and PI3KC2 -  contain binding sites for endocytic clathrin coats ( Engelman et al . , 2006 ) , ( b ) PI3KC2 -  was detected at CCPs ( Gaidarov et al . , 2001 ) , and ( c ) PI3KC2 -  was shown to interact with SH3 domains of intersectin 1 , an endocytic CCP component ( Fig . S2 ; Das et al . , 2007 ; Henne et al . , 2010 ) . In fact , TIRFM analysis confirmed that both PI3KC2 -  and PI3KC2 -  localized at CCPs in COS - 7 cells ( Fig . S2 , E and F ) . Although the main in vitro product of type II PI 3 - kinases is PI 3 - phosphate , it was reported that binding of PI3KC2 -  to clathrin modifies its substrate preference , thus enabling it to synthesize PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 from PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Gaidarov et al . , 2001 ) . PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 production accelerates endocytic CCP dynamics Based on the aforementioned considerations , we tested directly the effect of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 on CCP dynamics . Because acute stimulation by serum or purified growth factors is expected not only to increase PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 levels but also to affect the dynamics of proteins asso - ciated with the plasma membrane indirectly , via the stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation , we used a protocol selectively aimed at increasing PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . More specifically , we used the rapamycin - inducible FRB ( FKBP12 - rapamycin binding ) - FKBP ( FK506 - binding protein ) heterodimerization system to acutely recruit PI 3 - kinase to the plasma membrane ( Fig . 4 B ; Suh et al . , 2006 ; Varnai et al . , 2006 ; Zoncu et al . , 2007 ) . Plasma membrane – targeted CFP - FRB was coexpressed in COS - 7 cells together with RFP - FKBP ( as a control ) or with RFP - FKBP fused to the p110 - binding domain ( also called the inter - SH2 domain ) of the p85 regulatory subunit of type I PI 3 - kinase ( RFP – FKBP - iSH2 ) , which functions as a ligand cells ( Fig . S2 D ) , these results indicate that intersectin 1 regu - lates the CCP localization of SHIP2 . This possibility is consis - tent with the recent report that intersectin , as shown in this study for SHIP2 ( Fig . 1 ) , is an early component of CCPs that dissoci - ates from them before fission ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) . Binding of SHIP2 to intersectin 1 was shown to involve its SH3 domains ( Xie et al . , 2008 ) . Upon inspection of the 1022 – 1078 aa sequence of SHIP2 for proline - based putative SH3 - binding motifs using the Eukaryotic Linear Motif server ( http : / / elm . eu . org / ) and SH3 - Hunter websites ( http : / / cbm . bio . uniroma2 . it / SH3 - Hunter / ) , several candidate SH3 - binding sites were identi - fied , including the motif PPPDF ( aa 1050 – 1054 ) , which is simi - lar to the previously recognized SH3 binding motif PPPDY ( Mongioví et al . , 1999 ) . Pull - downs with GST – SHIP2 - 1022 – 1078 from brain extracts revealed that intersectin binding was disrupted by an F to A mutation at position 1054 ( Fig . 2 H ) . Moreover , full - length GFP – SHIP2 - F1054A mutant did not lo - calize at CCPs ( Fig . 2 E ) and produced the focal adhesion pat - tern as well as a diffuse localization ( Fig . 2 F ) . We conclude that the sequence of SHIP2 centered around the PPPDF sequence plays a key role in the localization of SHIP2 to CCPs . SHIP2 is a negative regulator of CCP growth We next explored a potential role of SHIP2 on CCP dynamics . COS - 7 cells were stably transfected with control short hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) or shRNA directed against SHIP2 to knock down this phosphatase ( Fig . 3 A ) . TIRFM of these cells after transient expression of GFP – clathrin light chain revealed that the mean CCP lifetime in SHIP2 KD cells ( 77 s ; n = 1 , 648 ; Fig . 3 B , red ; and Video 2 ) was 25 % shorter than in control cells ( 102 s ; n = 697 ; Fig . 3 B , blue ; and Video 3 ) . This change was accounted for , at least in part , by a faster rate of increase in the GFP - clathrin signal ( Fig . 3 C ) , suggesting that SHIP2 negatively regulates the speed of maturation of CCPs . Similar results were obtained by monitoring the effect of SHIP2 KD on the recruitment to the pits of three clathrin adaptors . The adaptor AP - 2 , as demonstrated by imaging its GFP - tagged  2 subunit , and the monomeric adaptors epsin1 ( epsin1 - GFP ) and CALM ( clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia ; GFP - CALM ) accumulated more rapidly and peaked earlier at CCPs of SHIP2 KD cells than in control cells ( Fig . 3 , D – F ) , with a time course that precisely paralleled that of clath - rin ( Fig . S3 ) . An earlier recruitment to the CCPs was also ob - served for dynamin ( dynamin - GFP ; Fig . 3 G ) , a critical factor for endocytic CCP fission , which is consistent with the overall shorter lifetime of the CCPs . SHIP2 and phosphoinositide levels PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , which binds all endocytic clathrin adaptors as well as dynamin , is a master regulator of endocytic clathrin coat assem - bly ( Gaidarov and Keen , 1999 ; Ford et al . , 2001 ; Collins et al . , 2002 ; Haucke , 2005 ; Zoncu et al . , 2007 ; Thieman et al . , 2009 ) . Although the preferred substrate for the inositol 5 - phosphatase activity of SHIP2 was reported to be PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( Damen et al . , 1996 ; Pesesse et al . , 1998 ) , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is also a substrate ( Taylor et al . , 2000 ) , as we have confirmed by an in vitro phosphatase on D e c e m be r 30 , 2013 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published August 2 , 2010 311 SHIP2 at clathrin - coated pits • Nakatsu et al . membrane accelerate CCP growth and turnover . Furthermore , the lifetime of CCPs was even faster ( 92 s ; n = 30 ; Fig . 4 D , green ) at the membrane ruffles ( Video 4 ) , i . e . , sites where the concentra - tion of GFP - Akt - PH , and thus PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , in the membrane is the highest . Collectively , these results suggest that dephosphoryla - tion of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , in addition to dephosphorylation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , is a mechanism through which SHIP2 controls CCP dynamics and increased levels of either of these phosphoinositides leads to accelerated CCP turnover . Concluding remarks Collectively , these results demonstrate that SHIP2 has an im - portant function in coat dynamics and signaling at endocytic CCPs , where intersectin plays a major role in its recruitment . for the endogenous p110 catalytic subunit of the kinase . Addition of the rapamycin analogue iRAP ( indole - modified analogue of rapamycin ) induced a robust translocation of RFP - FKBP ( not depicted ) or RFP – FKBP - iSH2 to the plasma membrane , as ex - pected ( Fig . 4 C ) . However , only in cells expressing RFP – FKBP - iSH2 , and not in cells expressing RFP - FKBP ( not depicted ) , were a recruitment of the PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 reporter GFP - Akt – pleck - strin homology ( PH ) to the plasma membrane and formation of ruffles also observed , indicating production of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 in this membrane ( Fig . 4 C ) . In cells expressing RFP – FKBP - iSH2 and treated with iRAP , the mean CCP lifetime ( 115 s ; n = 227 ; Fig . 4 D , red ) was  20 % shorter than in control cells expressing RFP - FKBP ( 149 s ; n = 186 ; Fig . 4 D , blue ) , support - ing the hypothesis that higher levels of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 in the plasma Figure 3 .

Thus , it would appear that CCP turnover and signaling involve sequential and co - ordinated actions of multiple inositol 5 - phosphatases . The rela - tive importance of each inositol 5 - phosphatase likely differs in different cell types , given the heterogeneous expression of these enzymes across tissues . Overall , an important role in endocytic clathrin coat dynamics and signaling appears to be a shared , evolutionary conserved function of several inositol 5 - phospahtases . The en - zymes that synthesize the substrates of these phosphatases , i . e . , PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , also have links to endocytic clathrin coats . More specifically , all three type I PIP kinases , i . e . , the PI 4 - phosphate 5 - kinases which are responsible for the bulk of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis in mammals ( Heck et al . , 2007 ; Volpicelli - Daley et al . , 2010 ) , can interact with the endocytic clathrin adaptor AP - 2 ( with the  isoform having additional high affin - ity binding sites for such adaptors ; Bairstow et al . , 2006 ; Krauss et al . , 2006 ; Thieman et al . , 2009 ) . As discussed in this study , PI 3 - kinases are also recruited to endocytic clathrin coats , al - though their contribution to the endocytic CCP dynamics at steady - state might be minimal because wortmannin , an inhibi - tor for PI 3 - kinases , hardly affected the dynamics ( Fig . S3 E ; Shpetner et al . , 1996 ) . The action of SHIP2 is important for attenuation of insulin - mediated signaling . Thus , endocytic CCPs represent Based on the impact of SHIP2 depletion on total PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 lev - els , at least some of these effects are likely to be mediated by its property to dephosphorylate PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in addition to PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . PTEN , the other negative regulator of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 signaling , does not act on PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Maehama and Dixon , 1999 ) , which may account for some of the different physiological actions of PTEN and SHIP2 . The previously unknown robust effect of SHIP2 in the regulation of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels raises the possibility that a reduc - tion in the availability of this substrate for PI 3 - kinases may contribute to the negative effect of SHIP2 on PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 signal - ing . The faster maturation and shorter lifetime of CCPs in SHIP2 KD cells not only agrees with a role of PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and possibly PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 in their dynamics but also supports the occur - rence of phosphoinositide turnover at CCPs , as first suggested by the early recruitment at pits of another inositol 5 - phosphatase , synaptojanin - 170 ( Fig . 5 ; Perera et al . , 2006 ) . Like SHIP2 , syn - aptojanin can act both on PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( Woscholski et al . , 1997 ; Cremona et al . , 1999 ; Mani et al . , 2007 ) . Because SHIP2 is recruited to CCPs from the initial stages but leaves be - fore fission , it most likely controls only growth and / or matura - tion of CCPs , whereas synaptojanin - 170 is also implicated in late endocytic steps , including clathrin uncoating after fission ( Fig . 5 ; Perera et al . , 2006 ) . Interestingly , intersectin also binds synaptojanin ( McPherson , 2002 ) , although it does not appear to have a dominant role in the recruitment of this protein to CCPs . OCRL , another inositol 5 - phosphatase that acts on both Figure 4 . PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 production acceler - ates endocytic CCP dynamics .

Protein identification by liquid chromatography – mass spectrometry was performed at Keck Research Facility at Yale University . RNA interference and stable cell lines COS - 7 cell lines expressing either control shRNA vector ( pRS - shGFP ) or pRS vector encoding SHIP2 - specific shRNA were established and main - tained in the presence of puromycin . For intersectin KD , COS - 7 cells were transfected with either control siRNA or stealth siRNA directed against intersectin 1 ( Invitrogen ) using RNAiMAX reagent ( Invitrogen ) . TIRFM Image acquisition was performed as described previously ( Perera et al . , 2006 ) . In brief , cells were imaged at 37°C by TIRFM using an objective - type inverted microscope ( IX - 70 ; Olympus ) fitted with a 60× NA 1 . 45 TIRFM lens ( Olympus ) and controlled by iQ software ( Andor Technology ) . Laser lines ( 488 and 568 nm ) from argon and argon / krypton lasers ( CVI Melles Griot ) were coupled to the TIRFM condenser through a single op - tical fiber . The calculated evanescent field depth was  100 nm . Cells were typically imaged in two channels by sequential excitation at 0 . 25 Hz , without binning , with 0 . 2 – 0 . 5 - s exposures and detected with a back - illuminated electron - multiplying charge - coupled device camera ( 512 × 512 pixels ; 16 - bit ; iXon887 ; Andor Technology ) . Rapalogue - induced PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 production COS - 7 cells expressing optimal levels of each marker ( clathrin - GFP , plasma membrane – FRB - CFP [ Varnai et al . , 2006 ; Zoncu et al . , 2007 ] , and mRFP - FKBP or mRFP – FKBP - iSH2 ) were preselected using wide - field epi - fluorescence , after which the imaging modality was switched to TIRFM . Clathrin - GFP and mRFP - FKBP or mRFP – FKBP - iSH2 were imaged by sequential illumination at 488 - nm and 568 - nm , respectively . After an initial imaging period of 7 – 10 min , rapalogue ( Zoncu et al . , 2007 ) was added to cells ( 5 µM iRAP or 500 nM AP021967 ) , and imaging was continued for an additional 20 min . Successful membrane recruitment of mRFP – FKBP - iSH2 was indicated by an increase in 568 - nm fluorescence by TIRFM . Image analysis Image analysis was performed using ImageJ ( National Institutes of Health ) and iQ software as described previously ( Perera et al . , 2006 ) . CCPs were randomly selected , and for each time point , the fluorescence intensity was normalized to the peak fluorescence intensity of that pit . Colocalization analysis was performed as described previously ( Perera et al . , 2006 ) . For graphs of fluorescence intensity , we analyzed at least 12 CCPs from at least three cells . For histograms of CCP lifetime , we analyzed at least 186 CCPs from at least three cells . Phosphoinositide analysis Levels of phosphoinositides were analyzed by separating glycerol - inositol phosphates with HPLC after phospholipid deacylation . For the analysis of major sites where the functions of phosphoinositide metabolism in membrane dynamics and signaling are integrated . Because SHIP2 is a promising target for therapeutic interventions aimed at restoring insulin sensitivity in type II diabetes ( Lazar and Saltiel , 2006 ; Suwa et al . , 2009 ) , our findings , which define a critical site of action of SHIP2 , may have implications toward the development of drugs that may help treat this disease . Materials and methods Plasmids and reagents Sources of cDNAs were as follows : GFP - ( mouse ) SHIP2 from U . Phillippar ( Massachusetts Institute of Technology , Cambridge , MA ) ; cortactin - DsRed from M . Kaksonen ( European Molecular Biology Laboratory , Heidelberg , Germany ) ; clathrin - GFP ( LCa - GFP ) from J . Keen ( Thomas Jefferson Uni - versity , Philadelphia , PA ) ; GFP – intersectin 1 – L and – S from P . McPherson ( McGill University , Montreal , Quebec , Canada ) ; mRFP - epsin from H . Chen ( De Camilli laboratory ) ; epsin - GFP from G . Ko ( De Camilli laboratory ) ; clathrin - mRFP ( LCa - mRFP ) from the De Camilli laboratory ( Zoncu et al . , 2007 ) ;  2 - GFP and GFP - CALM from A . Sorkin ( University of Pittsburgh , Pittsburgh , PA ) ; and dynamin - GFP from M . McNiven ( Mayo Clinic , Roch - ester , MN ) . SHIP2 mutants were generated by PCR , PCR - based mutagen - esis ( Nakatsu et al . , 2000 ) or the QuikChange kit ( Agilent Technologies ) . mCherry - actin was constructed by PCR . mCherry - SHIP2 was made by re - placing GFP with mCherry in the GFP - SHIP2 plasmid . To generate mRFP – FKBP - iSH2 , the inter - SH2 domain of the p85 regulatory subunit of human class I PI 3 - kinase was amplified by PCR and inserted at the C - terminal side of the FKBP module in the mRFP - FKBP backbone vector ( Zoncu et al . , 2007 ) . HuSH 29 - mer SHIP2 - specific shRNA and control shRNA constructs were purchased from OriGene Technologies . Anti – intersectin 1 antibodies were provided by P . McPherson . The fol - lowing antibodies were purchased : anti - GFP antibodies from Takara Bio Inc . and Invitrogen and anti –  - actin from Sigma - Aldrich . Anti - SHIP2 polyclonal an - tibodies were obtained by immunizing rabbits with a human SHIP2 fragment corresponding to aa 887 – 1019 and then affinity purified with protein G – Sepharose ( GE Healthcare ) by T . Itoh in the De Camilli laboratory . GST pull - down GST pull - downs were performed as described previously ( Erdmann et al . , 2007 ) . In brief , GST , GST – SHIP2 - 1022 – 1078 , or GST – SHIP2 - 1022 – 1078 - F1054A recombinant proteins were purified from Esch - erichia coli using glutathione - Sepharose beads ( GE Healthcare ) . Proteins immobilized on the beads were subsequently incubated with a rat brain extract generated by lysing brain tissue in lysis buffer ( PBS containing 1 % Triton X - 100 ) for 2 h at 4°C , followed by extensive washes with lysis buffer and PBS . Proteins retained on beads were eluted with SDS - PAGE Figure 5 . Inositol 5 - phosphatases at endocytic CCPs .

Stimulation of phosphatidylinositol kinase type I - mediated phosphatidylinositol PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI 4 - phosphate , which represent the bulk of PIP2 and PIP , respectively , the glycerol - inositol phosphate peaks derived from the PIP2 and PIP peak were identified and quantified using a conductivity detector ( Voronov et al . , 2008 ) . For the analysis of PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , cells were labeled with [ 3 H ] myo - inositol for 3 d and then harvested after stimulation with serum for 15 min after 24 - h serum starvation . The PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 peak was identified and quantified using a radiometric detector . Error bars show mean ± SD from three independent experiments . In vitro phosphatase assay The in vitro phosphatase assay ( malachite assay ) to monitor the enzymatic activity of SHIP2 against PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 was performed as de - scribed previously ( Mani et al . , 2007 ) . In brief , COS - 7 cells expressing GFP , GFP - SHIP2 , or GFP – SHIP2 - D608A were extracted in lysis buffer , and transfected proteins were purified by immunoprecipitation with protein G – Sepharose - immobilized anti - GFP antibodies . Aliquots of the immunoprecipi - tates were then either analyzed by Western blotting to confirm consistent recovery of transfected proteins or incubated with a water - soluble phospho - inositide substrate ( with a diC 8 - acyl chain ; Echelon ) for 30 min at 37°C . Aliquots of the bead supernatant at the end of this incubation were mixed with malachite - green solution , and released free phosphate was measured by a plate reader at 650 - nm wavelength ( Lee et al . , 2004 ) . Data show mean ± SD of three independent experiments . Online supplemental material Fig . S1 shows that GFP - SHIP2 is targeted to CCPs in different cell types and demonstrates the importance of the region of SHIP2 that contains the PPPDF motif in its targeting to CCPs in COS - 7 cells . Fig . S2 demonstrates the localization of intersectin , SHIP2 , PI3KC2 -  , and PI3KC2 -  at CCPs and shows that targeting of intersectin to CCPs is independent of SHIP2 . Fig . S3 shows the time course of the fluorescence intensity of clathrin - mRFP and GFP - tagged clathrin adaptors or dynamin at CCPs and that wortmannin has no effect on clathrin lifetime . Video 1 shows the dynamics of GFP - SHIP2 and clathrin - mRFP in COS - 7 cells . Videos 2 and 3 show the dynamics of clathrin - GFP in control and SHIP2 KD cells , respectively . Video 4 shows the dynamics of clathrin - GFP within a ruffle of a FKBP - iSH2 – expressing cell .
