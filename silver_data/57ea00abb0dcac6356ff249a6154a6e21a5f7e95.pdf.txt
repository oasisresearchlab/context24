The ﬂuctuations’ spatial and temporal correlations indicate that the cytoskeleton can be treated as a course - grained continuum with power - law rheology , driven by a spatially random stress tensor ﬁeld . Combined with recent cell rheology results , our data imply that intracellular stress ﬂuctuations have a nearly 1 / ω 2 power spectrum , as expected for a continuum with a slowly evolving internal prestress .

Ya , 87 . 10 . + e An accurate physical picture of the viscoelasticity and motion of the cytoskeleton is crucial for a complete un - derstanding of processes such as intracellular transport [ 1 ] , cell crawling [ 2 ] , and mechano - chemical transduction [ 2 ] . Microrheology [ 3 ] , based on the analysis of embedded tracer particle motion , has recently emerged as an exper - imental probe of cytoskeleton viscoelasticity and dynam - ics [ 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 ] . The viscoelastic properties of eucaryotic cells arise from an intricate network of protein ﬁlaments driven by specialized motor proteins and directional poly - merization , that convert the chemical energy of adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) to mechanical work and motion . A cell is thus a nonequilibrium soft material whose ﬂuctua - tions are actively driven . Unlike the thermal ﬂuctuations in an equilibrium material , the amplitude and spatial dis - tribution of active ﬂuctuations can be controlled via bio - chemical signaling pathways ; perhaps allowing the cell to locally adjust its’ mechanical properties to suit its’ needs . Indeed , microscopic force generators play a central role in existing cell mechanics models such as the sol - gel [ 8 ] , soft glassy rheology [ 4 ] and tensegrity [ 9 ] hypotheses . In this Letter , we extend a recently introduced method , termed two - point microrheology [ 10 ] , and show that it can be used to characterize the activity of intracellular force generators by directly measuring a cell’s intrinsic , random stress ﬂuctuations . Our experimental data and theoretical framework show that a cell can be modelled as a coarse - grained viscoelastic continuum driven by a spa - tially random stress ﬁeld having a 1 / ω 2 power spectrum in our observable frequency range , 1 < ω < 60 rad / s . There are two distinct approaches to microrheology : the active approach measures the displacements of tracer particles induced by external forces and the passive ap - proach measures ﬂuctuations of particle positions in the absence of driving forces . The active approach provides a direct measure of the complex shear modulus µ ( ω ) . In equilibrium systems the passive approach also mea - sures µ ( ω ) because of the ﬂuctuation - dissipation theo - rem ( FDT ) [ 11 ] . Literature results in cells using single - particle versions of the two approaches yield shear moduli diﬀering by orders of magnitude and exhibiting qualita - tively diﬀerent frequency dependencies [ 4 , 6 ] . These re - sults are further limited by ambiguities associated with tracer boundary conditions and medium heterogeneity and , more importantly , the applicability of the FDT . We show theoretically that data from passive two - point microrheology and active response experiments can be combined to measure the activity of molecular motors – speciﬁcally , the power spectrum of intracellular stress ﬂuctuations – despite the cell’s heterogeneity . We will ﬁrst discuss current microrheology approaches and our measurements . Microrheology relies on the Langevin equation [ 11 ] for the velocity v of a tracer particle , m∂ t v ( t ) = − Z t −∞ dt ′ γ ( t − t ′ ) v ( t ′ ) + f E ( t ) + f R ( t ) , ( 1 ) where m is the mass of the tracer particle , f E ( t ) is the external force , and f R ( t ) is the random force aris - ing from the medium . Stokes law states that γ ( ω ) = 6 πaµ ( ω ) / ( − iω ) [ 12 ] for spherical tracers with radius a and no - slip boundary conditions in an isotropic , homo - geneous viscoelastic medium with a complex shear mod - ulus µ ( ω ) . In the active scheme , f R ( t ) can be set to zero , and the displacement is r ( ω ) = χ ( ω ) f E ( ω ) , where χ ( ω ) = { − iω [ − imω + γ ( ω ) ] } − 1 is the response function . Several measurements of χ ( ω ) to extract the elastic moduli of the cytoskeleton of living cells have been per - formed [ 4 , 5 ] . In particular , Fabry et al . [ 4 ] have reported accurate measurements of the linear response to an ap - plied torque of a few - micron - diameter magnetic bead at - tached to the outside of a cell and strongly coupled to the cytoskeletal network via the cell’s integrin receptors . Remarkably , they found that over ﬁve decades in fre - quency , from 10 − 2 to 10 3 Hz , the shear modulus of sev - eral cell types was of order 1 kPa with a power law form | µ ( ω ) | ∼ ω β with 0 . 10 < β < 0 . 30 . Passive ‘one - point’ microrheology is based on the cor - relation function C r i r j ( t ) = h r i ( t ) r j ( 0 ) i . In thermal equi - librium , this correlation function is related through the 2 FDT to the response function χ ( ω ) : C r i r j ( ω ) = δ ij 2 k B T ω Im χ ( ω ) ≈ δ ij k B T 3 πa µ ′′ ( ω ) ω | µ ( ω ) | 2 . ( 2 ) The ﬁnal form is valid in the window ω a < ω < ω b , with the lower frequency ω a ∼ 10 − 2 Hz set by the compres - sional mode of the network and upper frequency ω b ∼ 10 5 Hz by inertial eﬀects [ 13 ] . Experiments typically measure tracers’ mean - squared - displacement ( MSD ) , h ∆ r 2 ( τ ) i = h ∆ r i ( t , τ ) ∆ r i ( t , τ ) i , where ∆ r i ( t , τ ) = r i ( t + τ ) − r i ( t ) and the brackets represent time and ensemble aver - ages . h ∆ r 2 ( τ ) i is related to the correlation function by h ∆ r 2 ( τ ) i = R dω 2 π ( 1 − e − iωτ ) C r i r i ( ω ) . Two - point passive microrheology experiments mea - sure a two - particle displacement tensor D ij ( R , τ ) ≡ h ∆ r ( 1 ) i ( t , τ ) ∆ r ( 2 ) j ( t , τ ) i , where the superscripts identify the two diﬀerent tracers , the brackets represent an en - semble average over all tracer pairs and time , and R is the separation between the two tracers . In thermal sys - tems , D ij ( R , τ ) can be related via the FDT to the shear moduli by two - particle equivalents of C r i r j ( ω ) , but with the 1 / a scaling replaced by 1 / R scaling . Importantly , it has been shown [ 13 , 14 ] that D ij ( R , τ ) is independent of tracer size , shape and boundary conditions ( to leading order in 1 / R ) . In cells , this allows the use of endogenous particles , unlike existing methods that attach or inject synthetic tracers which may perturb the cell . In systems where Eq . ( 2 ) is valid , D ij ( R , τ ) and h ∆ r 2 ( τ ) i have the same functional form vs . τ , diﬀering only by a geometri - cal constant . This leads to the deﬁnition of a two - point MSD , which may be thought of as an ideal Stokes par - ticle advected by random ﬂuctuations of the medium : h ∆ r 2 ( τ ) i 2 ≡ ( 2 R / a ) D rr ( R , τ ) , where D rr is the tensor component of D ij parallel to ˆ R . We made passive microrheology measurements on two cultured cell lines for which shear moduli µ ( ω ) had been measured previously [ 4 ] . All cells were cultured in Del - beco’s Modiﬁed Eagle Medium supplemented with 10 % calf serum and 50 mg / ml gentamicin in 5 % CO 2 . F9 cells were cultured in gelatin - coated tissue - culture ﬂasks . Cells were passed into glass - bottom cell - culture dishes with collagen - coated coverslips and allowed to incubate for either 4 - 6 hours ( F9 ) or overnight ( J774A . 1 ) prior to experiments . For tracers , we visualized endogenous re - fractive particles in the cells using diﬀerential interference contrast ( DIC ) microscopy and computed one - and two - particle correlations from the same multi - particle video tracking trajectories [ 15 ] . As our analysis assumes a three - dimensional continuum , we excluded trajectories from the thin lamellar region of the cell and the mechan - ically distinct nucleus , focussing instead on the midplane of the 6 - 8 µ m thick cells . We typically observed ∼ 100 sub - micron tracers ( presumed by morphology to be lipid granules and mitochondria ) within our 1 µ m focal depth . Thirty minutes of data yielded ∼ 10 7 tracer positions per cell , with respective time and space resolution of 1 / 60th sec and 20 nm . 0 . 01 0 . 10 1 . 00 10 . 00 t ( s ) 10 - 5 10 - 4 10 - 3 10 - 2 10 - 1 100 < D r 2 > , < D r 2 > 2 ( m m 2 ) F9 J774A . 1 t 1 t 1 . 5 2 10 R ( m m ) 0 . 3 1 . 3 .

Super - diﬀusive behavior , exponent greater than 1 , indicates the eﬀect of non - thermal ﬂuctua - tions . ( inset ) RD rr ( R , τ = 0 . 067 sec ) in units of 10 − 4 µ m 3 , is nearly constant in both cell types , as expected for a coarse - grained isotropic continuum . Typical MSD data for cells are presented in Fig . 1 . Although visual examination of the images occasionally shows ballistic tracer motion ( traﬃcking ) , driven presum - ably by kinesin and dynein motor proteins along micro - tubules , the ensemble averaged h ∆ r 2 ( τ ) i is dominated by random , apparently diﬀusive motion . From the two - point data , we ﬁrst veriﬁed that D rr ∼ 1 / R , [ Fig . 1 ( in - set ) ] in the accessible range 2 < R < 8 µ m , comparable to results in other studies [ 9 , 16 ] . In thermal systems at least , this ﬁnding suggests that the medium may be treated as a coarse - grained homogeneous continuum on the scale R . Strikingly , the two - point displacements of intracellular tracers exhibit a super - diﬀusive behavior : h ∆ r 2 ( τ ) i 2 ∼ τ α with exponent 1 . 30 < α < 1 . 60 . If a living cell were an equilibrium viscoelastic medium with µ ( ω ) ∼ ω β as reported in Ref . [ 4 ] , Eq . ( 2 ) would im - ply that h ∆ r 2 ( t ) i ∼ t β . Our data show that α > β and , thus , the FDT breaks down . While the one - point MSD suggests that the motion of single endogenous trac - ers is dominated by diﬀusive motion relative to the net - work , which may be thermal or non - thermal in origin , recent experiments have shown h ∆ r 2 ( τ ) i ∼ τ 1 . 5 for large ( several µ m ) phagocytosed tracers [ 6 ] . Such one particle measurements , however , can not distinguish between ad - vection by a driven continuum or traﬃcking relative to a stationary network . In constrast , our two - point MSD re - sults unambiguously indicate that the cytoskeleton itself has large strain ﬂuctuations driven by nonthermal forces . In living cells , active motors not only modify the vis - coelastic response of the cytoplasm , they also give rise to random , non - thermal stress ﬂuctuations that cause tracer particles to be subjected to random nonthermal forces . In such a system , Eq . ( 2 ) must be modiﬁed . We will out - line a careful derivation below , but we can easily guess it as follows : In thermal systems , the stress tensor has a 3 1 10 100 w ( rad / s ) 10 - 18 10 - 17 10 - 16 10 - 15 10 - 14 10 - 13 D ( w ) ( J 2 s / m 3 ) F9J774A . 1 w - 2 FIG . 2 : The intracellular stress ﬂuctuation spectrum ∆ ( ω ) as measured in two - point microrheology . The cell lines are J774A . 1 macrophage and F9 carcinoma . The dashed line rep - resents the thermal spectrum , 2 k B Tµ ′′ ( ω ) / ω , where µ ( ω ) is measured in Ref . [ 4 ] . random component s ij ( x , t ) whose local ﬂuctuations are described by h s ij ( x , ω ) s kl ( x ′ , ω ′ ) i = 2 π ∆ ( ω ) δ ( ω + ω ′ ) δ 3 ( x − x ′ ) × (cid:20) δ ik δ jl + δ il δ jk − 2 3 δ ij δ kl (cid:21) , ( 3 ) where ∆ ( ω ) = 2 k B Tµ ′′ ( ω ) / ω as dictated by FDT [ 17 ] . In non - equilibrium systems , there are stress ﬂuctuations of the same form , but with ∆ ( ω ) not locked to µ ′′ ( ω ) and we expect C r i r j ( ω ) ≈ δ ij ∆ ( ω ) 6 πa | µ ( ω ) | 2 , ( 4 ) where ∆ ( ω ) is now interpreted as the power spectrum of the stress ﬂuctuations whose microscopic origin is the ac - tivity of the motors . Equation ( 4 ) suggests that ( i ) trac - ers can exhibit superdiﬀusive behavior provided ∆ ( ω ) di - verges suﬃciently at small ω , and ( ii ) if an independent measure of µ ( ω ) exists , then ∆ ( ω ) can be sensibly ex - tracted from passive correlations data . To avoid artifacts associated with medium heterogene - ity and non - Stokes’ boundary conditions , we used Eq . ( 6 ) below , which is the two - point equivalent of Eq . ( 4 ) , along with rheological data reported in Ref . [ 4 ] , to convert our two - point data for both cell types to ∆ ( ω ) as shown in Fig . 2 . We found a nearly 1 / ω 2 spectra . These typi - cal results were replicated on 8 cells of each type . The variations of α and the power spectrum exponent among cells of each type , and within diﬀerent regions of a single cell , were comparable within our measurement error . A 1 / ω 2 spectrum corresponds to a linear decay in time of a stress - stress correlation function within our experimental time window , and would be a natural consequence of slow evolution of intracellular stress [ 18 ] . Note also that ∆ ( ω ) is a few orders of magnitude greater than the thermal spectrum ( dashed line ) , aﬃrming that these ﬂuctuations are driven by a nonthermal mechanism . In the case that the shear modulus and the stress spectrum have power - law forms , our result can be sim - ply stated . In living cells , with ‘power - law’ modulus µ ( ω ) ∼ ω β and a ∆ ( ω ) ∼ ω − γ spectrum , Eq . ( 4 ) im - plies that h ∆ r 2 ( τ ) i ∼ τ γ + 2 β − 1 . If the 1 / ω 2 spectrum we observe is universal , then one can measure the rheology exponent β via passive two - point measurements , using the formula h ∆ r 2 ( τ ) i 2 ∼ τ 1 + 2 β . The correspondence of our explicitly intracellular results with those of Fabry et al . [ 4 ] supports their assertion that they are measuring intracellular rather than cortical viscoelasticity . Now , we turn to our theoretical task and address the fundamental question : Given that living cells are highly heterogeneous non - equilibrium systems in which the FDT does not apply , do two - point passive microrheo - logical experiments overcome ambiguities associated with tracer boundary conditions and medium heterogeneity , and in conjunction with response measurements , extract the power spectrum of the continuum stress ﬂuctua - tions ? We ﬁrst postulate that a living cell at large length scale eﬀectively is an incompressible , viscoelastic medium characterized by a displacement ﬁeld u ( x , t ) , whose equa - tion of motion is given by ρ ∂ 2 u i ∂t 2 = ∂ j σ ij ( x , t ) + f i ( x , t ) , ( 5 ) where ρ is the coarse - grained mass density , f i ( x , t ) is the non - thermal random force density arising from the motors , and σ ij ( x , t ) is the stress tensor . Within lin - ear response theory , the stress σ ij ( x , t ) is related to the strain by σ ij ( x , ω ) = 2 µ ( ω ) u ij ( x , ω ) , where u ij = ( ∂ j u i + ∂ i u j ) / 2 is the strain tensor and µ ( ω ) the frequency - dependent shear modulus . Since there should be no net external force in a stationary cell , the random force must take the form f i ( x , t ) = ∂ j s ij ( x , t ) , where s ij ( x , t ) is a random stress tensor . We assume that its average is zero and variance given by Eq . ( 3 ) . To relate to our microrhe - ology experiments , we relate one - and two - particle corre - lation functions to stress ﬂuctuations ∆ ( ω ) and response to external forces µ ( ω ) as follows . We consider two tracer particles of radius a placed in this random medium and ask : What forces are exerted on each particles ? For simplicity , we assume that the heterogeneities near the vicinity of the tracers are well reﬂected by a local eﬀective shear modulus µ ∗ ( ω ) which may be diﬀerent from µ ( ω ) in the bulk . Let particle 1 ( 2 ) at x ( x ′ ) undergo a displacement ε ( 1 ) i ( ω ) ( ε ( 2 ) i ( ω ) ) . First , we decompose u ( x , t ) into an average part and a ﬂuctuating part : u ( x , t ) = ¯ u ( x , t ) + ˜ u ( x , t ) , and solve Eq . ( 5 ) subject to boundary conditions : ¯ u i ( | x | = a , ω ) = ε ( n ) i ( ω ) and ˜ u i ( | x | = a , ω ) = 0 , on the surface of the n th particle and ¯ u i ( | x | , ω ) , ˜ u i ( | x | , ω ) → 0 , far away from the particles . The total force exerted by the medium on each particles has two components : an aver - age , ¯ F ( n ) i ( ω ) = R S n dS ˆ n j ¯ σ ij ( x , ω ) , and a random parts , ˜ F ( n ) i ( ω ) = R S n dS ˆ n j ˜ σ ij ( x , ω ) , where ¯ σ ij = 2 µ ( ω ) ¯ u ij and ˜ σ ij = 2 µ ( ω ) ˜ u ij are , respectively , the average and ﬂuctu - 4 ating stress , and ˆ n j is the unit surface normal pointing towards the center of each particle . It is straightforward to compute ¯ F ( n ) i ( ω ) = P m χ − 1 ( m , n ) ij ( ω ) ε ( m ) i ( ω ) , where χ ( n , m ) ij ( ω ) is the two - particle response matrix given by χ ( 1 , 1 ) ij ( ω ) = δ ij 6 πaµ ∗ ( ω ) and χ ( 1 , 2 ) ij ( ω ) = ˆ R i ˆ R j 4 πRµ ( ω ) + δ ij − ˆ R i ˆ R j 8 πRµ ( ω ) , to the lowest order in 1 / R , where R ≡ | x − x ′ | , the distance between the two particles and ˆ R ≡ R / R ; the noise correlators are given by h ˜ F ( n ) i ( ω ) ˜ F ( m ) j ( − ω ) i = ∆ ( ω ) χ − 1 ( n , m ) ij ( − ω ) / µ ( − ω ) [ 19 ] . These results imply that h ε ( 1 ) i ( ω ) ε ( 1 ) j ( − ω ) i depends in a complicated way on µ ∗ ( ω ) and µ ( ω ) . In contrast , the cross - correlation func - tion as measured by two - point microrheology is D rr ( R , ω ) ≡ h ε ( 1 ) i ( ω ) ε ( 2 ) i ( − ω ) i = ∆ ( ω ) 6 πR | µ ( ω ) | 2 , ( 6 ) to the lowest order in 1 / R , which depends only on µ ( ω ) and ∆ ( ω ) in the bulk , and is independent of the tracers’ size , shape or boundary conditions . Thus , apart from a geometrical factor , Eqs . ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) are equivalent , and this justiﬁes our interpretation of our experiments . Fur - thermore , the 1 / R behavior shown in Fig . 1 ( inset ) not only implies that the living cell can be treated as a con - tinuum , but also requires that the random force f i ( x , t ) arises from a stress tensor of the form given in Eq . ( 3 ) . Lastly , we propose a microscopic picture of motor ac - tivities and derive a ﬂuctuating stress tensor . Since mo - tors are small but ﬁnite objects , their activities disturb the ambient cytoplasm in the form of a point dipole [ 20 ] . Since there is no net external force inside a sta - tionary cell , by Newton’s 3rd law , the force exerted on the cytoplasm by a motor must be equal and opposite to that of the cytoplasm on that motor . Thus , the part of the stress tensor arising from deviations δc a ( x , t ) of the coarse - grained activity density of motors from its average c a is s ij ( x , t ) = Γ (cid:0) ˆ n i ˆ n j − 13 δ ij (cid:1) δc a ( x , t ) , where ˆn is the direction of the point dipole and Γ is the energy scale . Since there is no preferred direction , we can average over all angles to obtain h s ij ( x , ω ) s kl ( x ′ , − ω ) i = Γ 2 15 (cid:20) δ ik δ jl + δ il δ jk − 2 3 δ ij δ kl (cid:21) × h δc a ( x , ω ) δc a ( x ′ , − ω ) i , ( 7 ) which has exactly the same form of Eq . ( 3 ) if the ﬂuctu - ations of motor activity is delta correlated in space . Fur - thermore , we can estimate the power associated with the stress ﬂuctuations by computing the power dissipated per tracer : h P i = R dω 2 π ω µ ′′ ( ω ) ∆ ( ω ) / | µ ( ω ) | 2 ∼ 10 − 16 W . Estimating ∼ 10 3 tracers per cell , the power to drive one cells’ ﬂuctuations is of the order of 10 − 13 W , which , as 1 % of typical cell metabolism , is not unreasonable . In conclusion , the interpretability of two - point mi - crorheology in complex media , including cells , serves to clarify an otherwise confusing set of biophysical ob - servations , supporting eﬀorts to model cells as three - dimensional continua rather than cortical shells and sug - gesting that the cytoskeleton is a highly dynamic , ac - tively stressed network . Future work to extend the tem - poral range and statistical power of such measurements should enable mapping and non - trivial spectroscopy of intracellular rheology and stress . Finally , such techniques may prove fruitful in other systems with non - thermal ﬂuctuations , such as granular and jamming media .
