In conventional optical materials , the nonlinearity at light powers corresponding to single photons is negligibly weak . Here we demonstrate a medium that is nonlinear at the level of individual quanta , exhibiting strong absorption of photon pairs while remaining transparent to single photons . The quantum nonlinearity is obtained by coherently coupling slowly propagating photons 3 – 5 to strongly interacting atomic Rydberg states 6 – 12 in a cold , dense atomic gas 13 , 14 . Our approach opens the door for quantum - by - quantum control of light ﬁelds , including single - photon switching 15 , all - optical deterministic 1 quantum logic 16 , and the realization of strongly correlated many - body states of light 17 . Recently , remarkable advances have been made towards optical systems that are nonlinear at the level of individual photons . The most promising approaches have used high - ﬁnesse optical cavities to enhance the atom - photon interaction probability 2 , 18 – 21 . In contrast , our present method is cavity - free and is based on mapping photons onto atomic states with strong interactions in an extended atomic ensemble 13 , 15 , 22 , 23 . The central idea is illustrated in Fig . 1 , where a quantum probe ﬁeld incident onto a cold atomic gas is coupled to high - lying atomic states ( Rydberg levels 24 ) by means of a second , stronger laser ﬁeld ( control ﬁeld ) . For a single incident probe photon , the control ﬁeld induces a spectral transparency window in the otherwise opaque medium via Electromagnetically Induced Transparency ( EIT 5 ) , and the probe photon travels at much reduced speed in the form of a coupled excitation of light and matter ( Rydberg polariton ) . However , in stark contrast to conventional EIT , if two probe photons are incident onto the Rydberg medium , the strong interaction between two Rydberg atoms tunes the transition out of resonance , thereby destroying the transparency and leading to absorption 15 , 22 , 23 , 25 , 26 . The experimental demonstration of an extraordinary optical material exhibiting strong two - photon attenuation in combination with single - photon transmission is the central result of this work . The quantum nonlinearity can be viewed as a photon - photon blockade mechanism that pre - vents the transmission of any multi - photon state . It arises from the Rydberg excitation blockade 27 , which precludes the simultaneous excitation of two Rydberg atoms that are separated by less than a blockade radius r b ( see Figure 1 ) . During the optical excitation under EIT conditions , an inci - 2 dent single photon is converted into a Rydberg polariton inside the medium . However , due to the Rydberg blockade , a second polariton cannot travel within a blockade radius from the ﬁrst one , and EIT is destroyed . Accordingly , if the second photon approaches the single Rydberg polariton , it will be signiﬁcantly attenuated , provided that r b exceeds the resonant attenuation length of the medium in the absence of EIT , l a = ( N σ a ) − 1 , where N is the peak atomic density and σ a the ab - sorption cross - section . This simple physical picture implies that , in the regime where the blockade radius exceeds the absorption length ( r b (cid:38) l a ) , two photons in a tightly focused beam not only cannot pass through each other 15 , but also cannot propagate close to each other inside the medium ( see Fig . 1c and detailed theoretical analysis below ) . Using Rydberg states with principal quantum numbers 46 ≤ n ≤ 100 , we can realize blockade radii r b between 3 µ m and 13 µ m , while for our highest atomic densities of N = 2 × 10 12 cm − 3 , the attenuation length l a is below 2 µ m . The optical medium then acts as a quantum nonlinear absorption ﬁlter , converting incident laser light into a non - classical train of single - photon pulses . EIT nonlinearities at the few - photon level have been previously observed without using strongly interacting atomic states by means of strong transverse conﬁnement of the light 28 , 29 . The interactions between cold Rydberg atoms have been explored in ensembles 6 – 10 , and have been used to realize quantum logic gates between two Rydberg atoms 11 , 12 , 24 . Enhanced optical nonlinearities using Rydberg EIT 15 , 22 , 23 have been observed in pioneering work 13 , 14 that we are building upon . Very recently , the Rydberg blockade in a dense , mesoscopic atomic ensemble has been used to implement a deterministic single - photon source 30 . 3 To observe the photon - photon blockade , several key requirements must be fulﬁlled . First , to eliminate Doppler broadening , the atoms should be cold so that they move by less than an optical wavelength during the microsecond lifetime of the EIT coherence . Second , the atomic cloud should be sufﬁciently dense such that the blockade condition r b (cid:38) l a is fulﬁlled . Finally , the system should be one - dimensional , i . e . the transverse size of the probe beam should be smaller than the blockade radius r b in order to prevent polaritons from traveling side by side . We fulﬁll these conditions by trapping a dense laser - cooled atomic ensemble and focusing the probe beam to a Gaussian waist w = 4 . 5 µ m < r b ( see Methods ) . We prepare an 87 Rb ensem - ble containing up to 10 5 atoms in a far - detuned optical dipole trap produced by a Nd : YAG laser operating at 1064 nm with a total power of 5W . The trap is formed by two orthogonally polarized beams with waists w t = 50 µ m intersecting at an angle of 32 ◦ . The atoms are optically pumped into the state | g (cid:105) = | 5 S 1 / 2 , F = 2 , m F = 2 (cid:105) in the presence of a 3 . 6 G magnetic ﬁeld along the quantization axis deﬁned by the common propagation direction of the probe and control beams along the long axis of the cloud . The probe beam on the | g (cid:105) → | e (cid:105) = | 5 P 3 / 2 , F = 3 , m F = 3 (cid:105) transition and the control beam on the | e (cid:105) → | r (cid:105) = | nS 1 / 2 , J = 12 , m J = 12 (cid:105) transition with waist w c = 12 . 5 µ m are oppositely circularly polarized . The resonant optical depth of the cloud can be as large as OD = 50 , with in - trap radial and axial rms cloud dimensions of σ r = 10 µ m and σ ax = 36 µ m , respectively . To avoid inhomogeneous light - shift broadening of the two - photon tran - sition , we turn off the optical dipole trap before turning on the probe and control light , and probe the Rydberg EIT system continuously for up to a few hundred microseconds . The control light is ﬁltered out from the transmitted light , and the photon - photon correlation function g ( 2 ) ( τ ) of the 4 probe beam is measured by means of two photon counters . The slow - light group delay τ d through the atomic medium 5 is measured independently in a pulsed experiment , and used to calculate the corresponding minimum group velocity v g = √ 2 πσ ax / τ d . Probe transmission spectra are presented in Fig . 2a for large optical depth OD = 40 and the control laser tuned to the Rydberg state | 100 S 1 / 2 (cid:105) . At very low incident photon rate R i ≤ 1 µ s − 1 , the spectrum displays an EIT transparency window with 60 % transmission . The transmission is mainly limited by the ﬁnite EIT decoherence rate γ gr , which for our system is dominated by Doppler broadening and laser linewidth . The extraordinary nonlinearity of the Rydberg EIT medium 13 becomes apparent as the incident photon rate is increased : the probe beam is strongly attenuated already at a photon ﬂux of R i ∼ 4 µ s − 1 . To demonstrate that we are operating in a quantum nonlinear regime , we show in Fig . 2b the correlation function g ( 2 ) ( τ ) of the transmitted probe light , measured at R i = 1 . 2 µ s − 1 . For the most strongly interacting state | 100 S 1 / 2 (cid:105) with r b = 13 µ m ≈ 5 l a ≈ 2 . 9 w we observe strong antibunching with g ( 2 ) ( 0 ) = 0 . 13 ( 2 ) , largely limited by background light . Subtraction of the independently measured background coincidence counts yields a corrected g ( 2 ) c ( 0 ) = 0 . 04 ( 3 ) . These observations are in stark contrast to EIT transmission via a less strongly interacting Rydberg state | 46 S 1 / 2 (cid:105) with r b = 3 µ m , where the photon statistics of the transmitted light are similar to those of the incident coherent state ( see inset ) . Interestingly , for | 100 S 1 / 2 (cid:105) the photons are anti - bunched over a length scale v g τ ∼ 50 µ m that exceeds the blockade radius ( see top axis of Fig . 2b ) , indicating the inﬂuence of additional propagation effects beyond the simple picture outlined above . 5 To investigate the transmission characteristics of multiple photons through the medium , we plot in Fig . 3a the output photon rate R o , scaled by the EIT transmission measured at low probe power , as a function of incident photon rate R i . At ﬁrst , R o increases linearly with R i as expected , but then saturates abruptly to a constant value of R o = 1 . 3 ( 3 ) µ s − 1 . Note that these observations deviate from the simplistic model of a multiphoton absorber that transmits only the one - photon component from the incoming coherent state ( black dashed line ) . At the same time , the observed output ﬂux corresponds to less than one photon in the medium ( R − 1 o > τ d = 300 ns ) . Figure 3b shows the saturated output rate versus the ratio r b / w of blockade radius and probe beam waist for a wide range of principal quantum numbers , control ﬁeld intensities , and optical depths . The ap - proximate R o ∝ ( w / r b ) 2 scaling , valid for w (cid:38) r b , indicates that the saturated rate for intermediate to strong interactions , r b (cid:38) l a , is largely determined by the transverse geometrical constraint , i . e . by the extent to which the Rydberg polaritons can propagate side by side through the medium . Two important features of the photon - photon blockade are the degree of two - photon suppres - sion at equal times , g ( 2 ) ( 0 ) , and the associated correlation time , i . e . , the width τ c of the antibunching feature in g ( 2 ) ( τ ) . As discussed in detail below , the blockade mechanism is most effective if the optical depth per blockade radius OD b = r b / l a exceeds unity 15 , and if the system is effectively one - dimensional , r b > w . Since the blockade radius 27 increases with the principal quantum num - ber n as r b ∝ n 11 / 6 , the combination of both effects results in a steep dependence of g ( 2 ) ( 0 ) upon n . Figures 4a , b show that g ( 2 ) ( 0 ) improves with principal quantum number n of the Rydberg state and interaction strength r b / l a , resulting in a more than tenfold suppression of the two - photon transmis - sion , limited by independently measured background light on the photon detectors ( dotted lines ) . 6 At the same time , the observed width τ c of the g ( 2 ) feature considerably exceeds the photon travel time τ b = r b / v g ∼ 50 ns through the blockade radius ( Figure 4c , d ) . Close examination ( Fig . 4d ) reveals that the correlation time is of the same order and scales inversely proportionally with the spectral width 5 B = γ EIT / √ 8 OD of the EIT transparency window . This observation suggests that propagation effects play an important role in establishing the g ( 2 ) correlation time τ c in a medium of large optical depth . Remarkably , we observe that , under appropriate conditions , two photon - events are suppressed inside the medium on a length scale that approaches the size σ ax ∼ 40 µ m of the entire atomic ensemble , and on a time scale that approaches the intrinsic coherence time γ − 1 gr = 500 ns . To gain further understanding of these observations , we theoretically analyze the photon propagation dynamics in the weak - probe limit where the average number of photons inside the medium is much less than one . In this case , it sufﬁces to consider two polaritons ( Fig . 1b ) . The corresponding two - photon component of the state vector 15 is | ψ 2 ( t ) (cid:105) = 12 (cid:82) d r 1 d r 2 EE ( r 1 , r 2 , t ) ˆ E † ( r 1 ) ˆ E † ( r 2 ) | 0 (cid:105) , where ˆ E ( r ) denotes the photon ﬁeld operator , and | EE ( r 1 , r 2 , t ) | 2 is the probability of ﬁnding two photons at locations r 1 , r 2 . This probability directly yields the spatially dependent photon - photon correlation function , and , via the group ve - locity v g , the corresponding temporal correlation function g ( 2 ) ( τ ) . An intuitive picture emerges if we make the simpliﬁcation of a tightly focused probe beam ( 1D approximation ) traveling through a homogeneous medium with perfect linear EIT transmission . In this case , the steady - state two - photon amplitude in the medium obeys ( see SI ) : ∂ R EE ( z 1 , z 2 ) = −V ( r ) l a EE ( z 1 , z 2 ) + 4 l a (cid:20) 1 + V ( r ) Ω 2 c Γ 2 (cid:21) ∂ 2 r EE ( z 1 , z 2 ) , ( 1 ) 7 where R = ( z 1 + z 2 ) / 2 and r = z 1 − z 2 are the center - of - mass and relative coordinates of the two photons , respectively . The function V ( r ) = r 6 b / ( r 6 b − 2 ir 6 ) can be regarded as an effective potential that describes the impact of Rydberg - Rydberg interactions 15 . For large photon - photon distances , r (cid:29) r b , the potential V vanishes , and equation ( 1 ) yields perfect transmission under EIT , while for distances r (cid:46) r b , the interaction V modiﬁes the two - photon propagation . According to equation ( 1 ) , photon correlations emerge from a combination of two processes : the ﬁrst term acts inside the blockade radius r b and describes absorption with a coefﬁcient l − 1 a as the interaction V tunes EIT out of resonance . This would create a sharp dip in the two - photon correlation function with a corresponding correlation time τ b = r b / v g associated with the blockade radius . However , if the corresponding spectral width ∼ τ − 1 b exceeds the spectral width B of the EIT transparency window 5 , the second diffusion - like term acts to broaden the absorption dip ( Fig . 1c ) in space and time , increasing the photon - photon correlation time τ c beyond τ b towards a value set by the EIT transparency width ( Fig . 4d ) . To maintain strong two - photon suppression ( g ( 2 ) ( 0 ) (cid:28) 1 ) in the presence of EIT - induced diffusion , the loss term must exceed the diffusion on the length scale of the blockade radius , requiring r b > l a . Large optical depth OD b = r b / l a of the blockaded region is therefore the key experimental feature that allows us to extend the earlier studies 13 , 14 into the quantum nonlinear regime . For direct comparisons with our experiments , we numerically solve the full set of propaga - tion equations accounting for the Gaussian density proﬁle of the trapped atomic cloud , the ﬁnite waist of the probe beam , and the imperfect single - photon transmission due to ﬁnite decoherence γ gr of the two - photon transition . As shown in Figures 2 and 4 , the theory captures the essential 8 features of our measured correlation functions and , moreover , reproduces their dependence on the Rydberg states , control laser intensities and optical depths of the sample over a wide range of parameters . This detailed theoretical understanding also allows us to analyze the prospects for possible future improvements . These include a reduction of Doppler broadening ( through lower atomic temperature or the use of counterpropagating probe and control beams ) to increase the lin - ear transmission from 60 % towards unity , the excitation of even higher - lying Rydberg states for larger blockade radius , and larger atomic density to further increase the optical depth per blockade radius OD b and overall optical depth OD . Our observations open intriguing prospects for ultimate quantum control of light quanta . For example , by storing a single photon in a Rydberg state and subsequently transmitting a second Rydberg polariton , a single - photon switch can be created 15 . It can be used , e . g . , for quantum non - demolition measurements of optical photons . At the same time , by using strong interactions in the dispersive regime , the present approach can be used to implement deterministic quantum logic gates 15 , 16 , which would constitute a major advance towards all - optical quantum information processing 31 . Finally , our results may open the door for exploring quantum dynamics of strongly interacting photonic many - body systems . For example , it may be possible to create a crystalline state of strongly interacting polaritons 17 . Beyond these speciﬁc applications , our work demon - strates that unique quantum nonlinear optical materials can be created by combining slow - light propagation with strong atom - atom interactions , an approach which can be potentially extended to realize other material systems with quantum nonlinearities . 9 Methods An ensemble of 6 × 10 6 laser - cooled atoms is captured in a magneto - optical trap ( MOT ) every 300 ms . The trapped cloud is compressed and loaded into the dipole trap by the combined actions of increasing the magnetic - ﬁeld gradient to 35 G / cm , detuning the MOT trapping frequency by − 30 MHz and reducing the MOT repumper intensity to 10 µ W / cm 2 . The magnetic ﬁelds are then rapidly shut off , allowing for 10 ms of molasses cooling to a temperature of 35 µ K . The crossed dipole trap holds up to 10 5 atoms at a peak density of 2 × 10 12 atoms / cm 3 and a measured optical depth of OD = 50 . The probe beam is focused to a 1 / e 2 waist w = 4 . 5 µ m by a confocal arrangement of achro - matic doublet lenses with focal length 30mm and diameter 6 . 25mm . The control ﬁeld is co - propagating with the probe beam . The frequencies of both lasers are locked to an optical Fabry - Perot resonator that is stabilized against long - term drifts to a Doppler - free atomic resonance line . The measured short - term linewidths are 120kHz and 80kHz for the probe and control laser , re - spectively . The transmitted control light is separated from the probe light by a combination of interference and absorption ﬁlters . The intensity correlation function of the outgoing probe ﬁeld is measured with two single - photon detectors . Spurious detection events typically limit g 2 ( τ ) ≥ 0 . 1 . These include dark counts from the detector , imperfect polarization of the probe photons ( light with the orthogonal circular polarization is only weakly absorbed by the medium ) and residual control light . 1 .

Co - propagating control and probe ﬁelds couple the ground - state | g (cid:105) to a high - lying Rydberg state | r (cid:105) via a short - lived excited state | e (cid:105) . Under EIT conditions , the probe photons slowly propagate in the medium as Rydberg polaritons . The Rydberg - Rydberg atom interaction V ( r ) = (cid:126) C 6 / r 6 shifts the Rydberg levels out of resonance and blocks simultaneous Rydberg excitations at close range . Consequently two Rydberg polaritons cannot both propagate when they are closer than the block - ade radius r b = ( 2 C 6 / γ EIT ) 1 / 6 , set by V ( r b ) = (cid:126) γ EIT / 2 , where γ EIT = Ω 2 c / Γ is the single - atom EIT linewidth as set by the control ﬁeld Rabi frequency Ω c and the decay rate Γ of state | e (cid:105) . c , d , Numerical simulations showing the spatial evolution of the probability distribution associated with two photons ( c ) and two Rydberg excitations ( d ) at positions ( z 1 , z 2 ) inside the medium , nor - malized by their values in the absence of blockade . Two Rydberg excitations are excluded from the blockaded range , resulting in the formation of an anti - bunching feature in the light ﬁeld , whose width increases during the propagation due to the ﬁnite EIT transparency width B = γ EIT / √ 8 OD . 15 Figure 2 : Two - photon optical nonlinearity . a , Transmission spectra versus probe detuning at various incoming photon rates : R i = 1 µ s − 1 , 2 µ s − 1 , 4 µ s − 1 , 6 µ s − 1 ( dashed green , solid red , dotted blue , and dot - dashed black , respectively ) for | 100 S 1 / 2 (cid:105) , EIT linewidth γ EIT = 2 π × 23 MHz , optical depth OD = 40 , and measured group delay τ d = 250 ns .

The dashed black curve outlines the expected rate if all multi - photon events in a time range τ = 320 ns are fully blocked , while the green dashed curve assumes that all multiphoton states within τ = 800 ns are converted into an outgoing one - photon state . b , Saturated rate of outgoing photons R o τ c per anti - bunching correlation time τ c , scaled by the linear absorption , as a function of the ratio between the blockade radius r b and the probe beam waist w . The Rydberg states are | 100 S 1 / 2 (cid:105) ( blue , w = 4 . 5 µ m , OD b ∼ 8 ; pink , w = 4 . 5 µ m , OD b ∼ 4 ) , | 77 S 1 / 2 (cid:105) ( black , w = 4 . 5 µ m , OD b ∼ 3 ) , | 46 S 1 / 2 (cid:105) ( green , w = 4 . 5 µ m , OD b ∼ 0 . 7 ; red , w = 7 µ m , OD b ∼ 0 . 7 ) . τ c is estimated using the single - atom EIT linewidths ( γ (cid:3) EIT , γ (cid:52) EIT , γ ◦ EIT , γ (cid:5) EIT ) = 2 π × ( 6 - 16 , 18 - 26 , 29 - 36 , 50 ) MHz , and varies from 60 to 330 ns . The dashed line corresponds to 0 . 9 ( w / r b ) 2 , indicating the expected scaling with transverse conﬁnement for w (cid:38) r b . 17 Figure 4 : Dependence of the correlation function on EIT parameters . a , b , Equal - time photon - photon correlation g ( 2 ) ( 0 ) as a function of OD for | 77 S 1 / 2 (cid:105) ( a ) and | 100 S 1 / 2 (cid:105) ( b ) , for a set of single - atom EIT linewidths ( γ (cid:13) EIT , γ (cid:79) EIT , γ (cid:52) EIT , γ (cid:47)EIT ) = 2 π × ( 20 , 27 , 16 , 26 ) MHz .
