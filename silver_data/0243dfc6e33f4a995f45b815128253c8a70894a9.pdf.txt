Molecular Biology of the Cell Vol . 3 , 1389 - 1402 , December 1992 Morphological Classification of the Yeast Vacuolar Protein Sorting Mutants : Evidence for a Prevacuolar Compartment in Class E vps Mutants Christopher K . Raymond , * Isabelle Howald - Stevenson , Carol A . Vater , t and Tom H . Stevens Institute of Molecular Biology , University of Oregon , Eugene , Oregon 97403 Submitted August 13 , 1992 ; Accepted October 5 , 1992 The collection of vacuolar protein sorting mutants ( vps mutants ) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae comprises of 41 complementation groups . The vacuoles in these mutant strains were ex - amined using immunofluorescence microscopy . Most of the vps mutants were found to possess vacuolar morphologies that differed significantly from wild - type vacuoles . Fur - thermore , mutants representing independent vps complementation groups were found to share aberrant morphological features . Six distinct classes of vacuolar morphology were observed . Mutants from eight vps complementation groups were defective both for vacuolar segregation from mother cells into developing buds and for acidification of the vacuole . Another group of mutants , represented by 13 complementation groups , accumulated a novel organelle distinct from the vacuole that contained a late - Golgi protein , active vacuolar H + - ATPase complex , and soluble vacuolar hydrolases . We suggest that this organelle may represent an exaggerated endosome - like compartment . None of the vps mutants appeared to mislocalize significant amounts of the vacuolar membrane protein alkaline phosphatase . Quantitative immunoprecipitations of the soluble vacuolar hydrolase carboxypeptidase Y ( CPY ) were performed to determine the extent of the sorting defect in each vps mutant . A good correlation between morphological phenotype and the extent of the CPY sorting defect was observed . INTRODUCTION Organelle biogenesis in eukaryotic cells requires the se - lective assembly of specific proteins , lipids , and other constituents from a common pool of biosynthetic in - termediates . The biogenesis of the yeast vacuole was chosen as a model system for organelle assembly be - cause most vacuolar functions are dispensible for the growth of vegetative cells , and hence it was possible to generate a large collection of mutants with defects in vacuole assembly ( reviewed in Klionsky et al . , 1990 ; Raymond et al . , 1992a ) . Most soluble and integral membrane proteins of the yeast vacuole studied to date enter the endoplasmic reticulum and traverse the se - cretory pathway through the Golgi complex ( Stevens * Present Address : ZymoGenetics , Inc . , 4225 Roosevelt Way NE , Seattle , WA 98115 . t Present address : Immunogen , Inc . , 148 Sydney Street , Cambridge , MA 02139 - 4239 . et al . , 1982 ; Klionsky et al . , 1988 ; Klionsky and Emr , 1989 ; Moehle et al . , 1989 ; Roberts et al . , 1989 ; Hirsh et al . , 1991 ) . Vacuolar proteins appear to be sorted from cell surface and resident Golgi proteins in a late Golgi compartment . This was elegantly documented in the case of the soluble vacuolar glycoprotein carboxypep - tidase Y ( CPY ) , which was shown to be sorted to the vacuole after passage through the most distal Golgi compartment characterized in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Graham and Emr , 1991 ) . The precursor form of CPY carries positive sorting information that directs the protein to the vacuole ( Johnson et al . , 1987 ; Valls et al . , 1987 , 1990 ) . In the absence of this sorting signal , the protein is secreted ( Stevens et al . , 1986 ) . To identify genes whose products participate in the sorting process , positive selections for mutants that secrete CPY were devised ( Bankaitis et al . , 1986 ; Rothman and Stevens , 1986 ) . Complementation testing among a large collection of such vacuolar protein sorting ( vps ) mutants has indicated that as many as 40 C ) 1992 by The American Society for Cell Biology 1389 C . K . Raymond et al . VPS genes influence CPY sorting ( Robinson et al . , 1988 ; Rothman et al . , 1989a ) . Additional analyses have shown that all of the vps mutants exhibit defects in the sorting of several other soluble vacuolar proteins ( Robinson et al . , 1988 ; Rothman and Stevens , 1986 ) . The large num - ber of vps complementation groups demonstrates that vacuole assembly is a complex process . Phenotypic characterization of the vps mutants sug - gests that a wide range of vacuolar biogenesis defects may influence the fidelity of soluble protein sorting . Certain mutants were found to have gross alterations in vacuolar morphology or to lack an acidic vacuolar lumen ( Rothman and Stevens , 1986 ; Banta et al . , 1988 ; Rothman et al . , 1989a , b ) . Initial characterization of vac - uolar morphology in the vps mutant collection was con - ducted at the level of the light microscope using the vacuolar lumenal marker fluorescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) and Nomarski optics , as well as by thin - section electron microscopy ( Banta et al . , 1988 ) . These tech - niques were sufficient to divide the vps mutant collection into three classes based on vacuolar morphology ( Banta et al . , 1988 ) . Most of the vps mutants , class A , contained vacuoles that appeared similar to those in wild - type cells . Certain mutants , class B , contained numerous small vacuole - like compartments . Four vps mutants , class C , exhibited the most extreme defect in vacuolar morphology and appeared to lack vacuoles altogether . Although initial studies indicated that the vast ma - jority of vps strains possessed relatively normal vacuoles ( Banta et al . , 1988 ; Rothman et al . , 1989a ) , recent ad - vances in fluorescence microscopy and the availability of antibodies that recognize vacuolar membrane pro - teins have provided powerful new tools for phenotypic analysis ( Pringle et al . , 1989 ; Roberts et al . , 1991 ) . These techniques provided a clear demonstration that vacuole inheritance in wild - type cells occurs via vacuolar seg - regation structures ; the term " vacuole inheritance " re - fers to the process by which daughter cells receive vac - uolar material from mother cells ( Zubenko et al . , 1982 ; Weisman et al . , 1987 ) , and the term vacuolar " segre - gation structure " refers to the morphologically distinct projection of mother cell vacuoles into developing buds during a specific period in bud enlargement ( Weisman and Wickner , 1988 ; Raymond et al . , 1990 ; Weisman et al . , 1990 ; Gomes de Mesquita et al . , 1991 ; Shaw and Wickner , 1991 ) . Microscopic analysis demonstrated that vps3 and vps34 mutants were defective for vacuolar segregation ( Herman and Emr , 1990 ; Raymond et al . , 1990 ) . The fact that both mutants were originally thought to have wild - type vacuoles prompted us to reexamine the vps mutant collection using indirect im - munofluorescence microscopy . We report that the vac - uoles in most of the vps mutants differ significantly from the wild - type organelle and that the entire collection of vps mutants can be subdivided into specific groups based on the morphological traits of their vacuoles . MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains , Media , Materials , and Antibodies The yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 . New vacuolar protein localization ( vpl ) complementation groups were identified by selection for mutants ( Vps - ) that secrete the vacuolar protein CPY followed by complementation testing as described previously ( Roth - man and Stevens , 1986 ; Rothman et al . , 1989a ) , except that CPY secretion was monitored using a plate overlay immunoblotting tech - nique ( Rothman et al . , 1986 ; Roberts et al . , 1991 ) . The vps27 - A1 : : LEU2 mutation was constructed by substituting the LEU2 gene for a portion of the VPS27 open reading frame and by transplacement of this construct into the indicated yeast strains . DNA was transformed into yeast strains by electroporation using a Bio - Rad ( Richmond , CA ) gene pulser as recommended by the manufacturer . Rich growth me - dium was yeast peptone dextrose ( YPD ) , minimal medium was syn - thetic dextrose ( SD ) supplemented with appropriate nutrients , and sporulation medium was a standard recipe , all as described in Sherman et al . ( 1982 ) . The Escherichia coli strain used in this study was MC1061 ( Casadaban and Cohen , 1980 ) . Antibodies that recognize alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) , the product of the PH08 gene , were generated by subcloning the - 1000 base pair ( bp ) Xba I - Sal I fragment of PH08 ( Kaneko et al . , 1987 ) into the E . coli protein expression vector pEXP2 ( Raymond et al . , 1990 ) . The 38 - kDa ALP protein fragment produced from this plasmid , pGP100 , was purified from E . coli and injected into rabbits as described in Roberts et al . ( 1989 ) . A second overlapping - 875 bp Bgl II - Sal I fragment from the PH08 gene was also subcloned into pEXP2 to give pGP102 , and the resulting 35 - kDa protein fragment was used to con - struct an affinity column by linking it to cyanogen bromide - activated Sepharose ( Sigma Chemical , St Louis , MO ) . ALP - specific antibodies were affinity purified from rabbit serum as described by Raymond et al . ( 1990 ) , and microscopy - grade adsorbed antibodies that recognize ALP were prepared as described by Roberts et al . ( 1991 ) . Monoclonal antibodies that recognize the 60 - kDa subunit of the vacuolar H + - adenosine triphosphatase ( ATPase ) ( V - ATPase ) were prepared by Kane et al . ( 1989 , 1992 ) . For immunofluorescence , rabbit antibodies directed against yeast CPY were affinity - purified using a CPY - Seph - arose column , as described above . Polyclonal rabbit anti - CPY serum used for immunoprecipitations was prepared by subcloning the 1150 - bp BamHI fragment from the CPY structural gene , PRC1 ( Stevens et al . , 1986 ) , into the E . coli protein expression vector pEXP2 ( Raymond et al . , 1990 ) . The 42 - kDa CPY fragment was purified from E . coli extracts and injected into rabbits as described by Roberts et al . ( 1989 ) . Secondary antibodies for indirect immunofluorescence were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch ( West Grove , PA ) and prepared ac - cording to the recommendations of the manufacturer . Other reagents were from Sigma Chemical , except as specified below . Fluorescence Microscopy Vacuolar morphology was examined in fixed yeast strains by indirect immunofluorescence techniques essentially as described by Roberts et al . ( 1991 ) . Ten - milliliter log phase cultures at a density of 2 . 5 - 5 X 106 cells / ml in YPD at 30°C were fixed by the addition of 1 . 2 ml 37 % formaldehyde ( I . T . Baker Chemical , Phillipsburg , NJ ) with gentle shaking . After 30 min , the cells were transferred to 2 ml of standard fixative ( Roberts et al . , 1991 ) and shaken overnight ( 12 - 16 h ) at room temperature . The cells were then harvested in a clinical centrifuge , resuspended in 1 ml of 200 mM tris ( hydroxymethyl ) aminomethane ( Tris ) , pH 8 . 0 , 20mM EDTA , and 1 % 13 - mercaptoethanol , transferred to a microfuge tube , and incubated for 10 min . Pelleted cells were resuspended in spheroplast buffer containing 1 . 2 M sorbitol , 50 mM KPO4 , pH 7 . 3 , 1 mM MgCl2 , 15 , g / ml zymolyase 100T ( ICN Biomed - icals , Irvine , CA ) , and 25 Al / ml glusulase ( DuPont , Boston , MA ) and incubated with occasional shaking for 30 min at 30°C . Spheroplasted cells were harvested by centrifugation at - 5000 X g for 30 s , washed once in 1 ml of 1 . 2 M sorbitol , and split into two 500 , l aliquots . One aliquot was treated with 5 % sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) for 5 min for ALP staining ( by adding 500 Ml 10 % SDS in 1 . 2 M sorbitol ) , and Molecular Biology of the Cell 1390 Vacuolar Morphology in Yeast vps Mutants the other was treated with 1 % SDS for 30 s for 60 - kDa V - ATPase subunit staining . Both treated aliquots were subsequently washed twice with 1 ml of 1 . 2 M sorbitol and resuspended in 1 ml 1 . 2 M sorbitol . Forty - microliter aliquots of fixed treated cells were placed on poly - lysine - coated multiwell test slides ( ICN Biomedicals ) that were pre - pared by placing a 1 mg / ml solution of polylysine bromide ( Sigma Chemical ) into each well for 30 s followed by six washes with water and air drying . After 10 min , the wells were washed three times with phosphate - buffered saline containing 5 mg / ml bovine serum albumin ( PBS - BSA ) ( Roberts et al . , 1991 ) , and the slides were incubated in a humid chamber for 15 min . Antibodies were then added . For ALP staining , the primary antibody was used at a 1 : 10 dilution , and the secondary antibodies were used at a 1 : 100 dilution of biotinylated goat anti - rabbit followed by a 1 : 100 dilution of FITC - conjugated streptavidin . For 60 - kDa V - ATPase subunit staining , the primary an - tibody was used at a 1 : 20 dilution , and the secondary antibodies were used at a 1 : 200 dilution of biotinylated goat anti - mouse followed by a 1 : 200 dilution of FITC - streptavidin . For the ALP / 60 - kDa double - labeling experiment ( Figure 7 ) , 1 : 10 ALP and 1 : 10 60 - kDa V - ATPase subunit antibodies were added in the first incubation , followed by 1 : 100 biotinylated goat anti - rabbit and 1 : 100 rhodamine - conjugated goat anti - mouse in the second incubation and 1 : 100 FITC - streptavidin in the final incubation . For the CPY / 60 - kDa subunit double - labeling experiment ( Figure 7 ) , 1 : 1000 CPY and 1 : 10 60 - kDa V - ATPase subunit antibodies were added in the first incubation , followed by 1 : 100 FITC - goat anti - rabbit and 1 : 200 biotinylated goat anti - mouse in the second incubation , and 1 : 200 rhodamine - streptavidin in the final incubation . The concentration of primary antibody solutions was not determined , and the dilutions used for optimal staining were determined empir - ically . Secondary antibodies were supplied or prepared as 1 - mg / ml solutions . All antibody incubations were for 1 h , and several PBS - BSA washes were conducted between antibodies . After antibody la - beling was complete and the wells were washed several times , mounting medium ( Pringle et al . , 1989 ) was added to each well , and the slides were covered with a coverslip . The cells were viewed and photographed as described by Raymond et al . ( 1990 ) . Quinacrine staining of live cells was conducted as described pre - viously ( Roberts et al . , 1991 ) . CPY Immunoprecipitation Yeast cultures were grown overnight in SD - Met to an optical density at 600 nm of - 1 ( OD600 = 1 ) . Cells were centrifuged and resuspended at OD600 = 1 in SD - Met , 50 mM KPO4 , pH 5 . 7 , and 2 mg / mL BSA . The cultures were pulse - labeled for 10 min at 30°C with 200 AiCi / l OD600 of cells with [ 35S ] MET [ 355 ] CYS ( EXPRE35S35S label , New England Nuclear , Boston , MA ) . Labeled cultures were chased with 80 Mg / ml of Met and Cys at 30°C for 30 min . The pulse - chase was terminated by the addition of NaN3 to 10 mM . The cells were spheroplasted , separated into intracellular and extracellular fractions , and CPY was immunoprecipitated from each fraction as described by Stevens et al . ( 1986 ) with the following modifications . Intracellular and extracellular fractions were heated for 5 min at 100°C after the addition of 0 . 5 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride , 1 Mg / ml pepstatin , 1 A , g / ml leu - peptin , 0 . 13 % SDS , and 0 . 13 % Triton X - 100 ( final concentrations ) . Samples were preadsorbed with 50 , ul of 10 % IgGSORB ( The Enzyme Center , Malden , MA ) for 15 min on ice . The supernatants resulting after centrifugation were incubated with anti - CPY polyclonal antibody for 1 h on ice . Another aliquot of IgGSorb was added , and after 1 h on ice the precipitated immune complexes were washed twice with 10 mM Tris HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 1 % SDS , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , and 2 mM EDTA . Immunoprecipitated samples were analyzed by SDS - poly - acrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography . The radioactivity of immunoprecipitated CPY in the intracellular and extracellular fractions was quantified using an AMBIS Radioanalytic Imaging System ( Ambis Systems , San Diego , CA ) . RESULTS Analysis of Vacuolar Morphology and Protein Sorting in the vps Mutant Collection The vps mutants , all of which were selected for secretion of CPY or a CPY fusion protein , were generated in two Vol . 3 , December 1992 different laboratories and originally designated as vac - uolar protein localization ( vpl ) mutants ( Rothman and Stevens , 1986 ; Rothman et al . , 1989a ) or vacuolar pro - tein targeting ( vpt ) mutants ( Bankaitis et al . , 1986 ; Rob - inson et al . , 1988 ) . The common vps nomenclature was introduced because many of the vpl and vpt mutants defined the same complementation groups , i . e . , they carried mutations in many of the same genes ( Robinson et al . , 1988 ; Rothman et al . , 1989a ) . There have been several revisions to the vps mutant list since the last available publication ( Klionsky et al . , 1990 ) , and the current compilation of vps complementation groups is shown in Table 2 . Vacuoles were visualized using indirect immunoflu - orescence techniques ( Pringle et al . , 1989 ; Roberts et al . , 1991 ) . Two antibody preparations that recognize either ALP or the 60 - kDa subunit of the vacuolar H + - ATPase ( V - ATPase ) were used . ALP is an integral membrane protein of the vacuole ( Kaneko et al . , 1987 ; Klionsky and Emr , 1989 ) , and antibodies directed against ALP clearly delineate the vacuolar membrane ( Raymond et al . , 1990 ; Roberts et al . , 1991 ) . The 60 - kDa V - ATPase subunit is a peripheral membrane protein that associates as part of a multi - subunit complex with the cytoplasmic face of the vacuole ( Kane et al . , 1989 , 1992 ; Yamashiro et al . , 1990 ) . Antibodies directed against the 60 - kDa V - ATPase subunit stain the vacuolar membrane in wild - type cells , and they yield a diffuse cytoplasmic staining pattern in mutants that fail to assemble an active V - ATPase complex ( Kane et al . , 1992 ) . Vital staining with quinacrine was also used as a qualitative assay of vac - uolar acidification in live cells . Quinacrine is a basic fluorescent compound that accumulates in acidified in - tracellular compartments such as the yeast vacuole ; loss of vacuolar acidification due to dissipation of the pH gradient with 200 mM ammonium acetate , inhibition of the V - ATPase with the drug bafilomycin A1 , or mu - tations that perturb V - ATPase function largely abolish quinacrine staining ( Weisman et al . , 1987 ; Banta et al . , 1988 ; Rothman et al . , 1989b ; Yamashiro et al . , 1990 ) . Vacuolar protein sorting was monitored by pulse - chase labeling of cells , immunoprecipitation of CPY from in - tracellular and extracellular fractions , and quantitation of CPY in the immunoprecipitates . At least two mutant strains from each complemen - tation group were examined by the techniques described above . Additional alleles were examined for groups where the initial two mutants gave inconsistent results . The pairs of MATa and MATa vps mutant alleles re - ported in this study are shown in Table 1 . Within the 41 vps mutant groups studied , six different classes of mutant vacuolar morphology were observed that could be readily differentiated from one another . To be con - sistent with previous publications , the nomenclature of Banta et al . ( 1988 ) was used and extended to include additional classes , as described in detail in later sections . 1391 C .

The diploid was sporulated and haploid progeny that were both pho8A and vps27A were used for further study . Because the parents of the diploid strain were both His - , but at two different HIS loci ( his3 or his4 ) , it is known that CRY2 - 8A is His - , but the genotypes of the HIS loci have not been established . d Pairs of vpt mutants used in this study are listed by allele number , with the MATa mutant followed by the MATa mutant .

They are as follows . 1 ) Ten new vpl complementation groups were identified that have not been previously published ( vpl20 through vpl31 , except vpl22 and vp129 , which were eliminated ) . Five of these vpl groups overlap with established vps groups and five define five new vps com - plementation groups . 2 ) Four previously undetected overlaps between vpl and vpt mutants were discovered . Based on comparison of re - striction maps of cloned genes , VPS7 is the same as VPS34 and VPS40 is the same VPS15 ( Herman and Emr , 1990 ; Herman et al . , 1991 ; Raymond and Stevens , unpublished data ) . In addition , vps2 mutants failed to complement vps14 mutants and vps12 mutants failed to com - plement vps2l strains . When diploids from these crosses were spor - ulated and haploid progeny analyzed ( from at least 15 four spore tetrads ) , the Vps - phenotype segregated 4 : 0 . This demonstrates that both sets of overlaps are the consequence of allelic mutations in the same gene . 3 ) Diploids formed between several alleles of vpl5 and vpt5 complemented one another , indicating that the two groups define separate genes . However , the vpl5 mutants failed to complement vpt32 mutants , and thus these two sets of mutants form one complemen - tation group . To incorporate these changes vps5 = vpt5 and vps32 = vp / S = vpt32 . Class A vps Mutants Have Vacuoles Similar to Those of Wild - type Cells The morphology of vacuoles in wild - type yeast strains and the changes the organelle undergoes during the growth of vegetative cells or on entry into stationary phase have been described extensively elsewhere ( Weimken et al . , 1970 ; Weisman et al . , 1987 ; Weisman and Wickner , 1988 ; Pringle et al . , 1989 ; Raymond et al . , 1990 ; Gomes de Mesquita et al . , 1991 ) . The wild - type parent strains of the vps mutants ( Table 1 ) all possess similar vacuolar morphologies ( Figure 1 , A - D ; Ray - mond , 1990 ) . The organelle generally appears to have 1 - 10 lobes that cluster together in one region of the cell . During the cell cycle , portions of the mother vacuole appear to actively partition into developing buds ( Figure 1 , A - D ) . The characteristic mother to bud vacuolar ex - tensions have been termed vacuolar " segregation struc - tures " ( Raymond et al . , 1990 ; Gomes de Mesquita et al . , 1991 ) , and the process whereby maternal vacuolar ma - terial is passed to daughter cells has been termed " vac - uole inheritance " ( Weisman et al . , 1987 , 1990 ; Weisman and Wickner , 1988 ; Shaw and Wickner , 1991 ) . In wild - type cells , the ALP staining pattern and the 60 - kDa subunit staining pattern are virtually indistinguishable ( Figure 1 , A - D ) , indicative of the fact that both ALP and the V - ATPase reside predominantly on the vacuolar membrane . Mutants from nine vps complementation groups were found to have vacuoles similar to wild - type , and in keeping with previous work these were designated as having a " class A " morphological phenotype ( Table 3 ) ( Banta et al . , 1988 ) . In some mutants ( vpslO , vpsl3 , vps44 , vps46 ) , there was no detectable difference be - tween the vacuoles in the mutants and those in the wild - type parents . In the remaining mutant strains ( vps8 , vps29 , vps3O , vps35 , vps38 ) , the morphology of the vac - uole was slightly perturbed , as is shown for the vps35 mutant in Figure 1 , E - H . Most of these mutant cells appeared to have one to two vacuoles per cell with a single round vacuole per cell being the predominant morphology . Although vacuolar segregation structures were far less prominent in this set of mutants than in wild - type strains , all large buds possessed distinct vac - uoles indicative of normal vacuole inheritance . Fur - thermore , antibodies directed against the 60 - kDa sub - unit of the V - ATPase decorated the vacuolar membrane , and quinacrine accumulation was normal in these class A vps mutants , suggesting that the V - ATPase complex was properly assembled . The amount of newly synthe - sized CPY secreted from the class A vps mutants was somewhat variable ( Table 3 ) , particularly among the strains with vacuoles that were most similar to wild - type . Class B vps Mutants Possess Fragmented Vacuoles Certain vps mutants displayed a fragmented vacuole phenotype . These strains were designated previously Vol . 3 , December 1992 1393 C . K . Raymond et al . Figure 1 . Vacuole morphology in the wild - type strain SF838 - 9D ( A - D ) and the class A mutant vps35 ( vpt7 ; E - H ) . ALP staining is shown in B and F , 60 - kDa V - ATPase subunit staining in D and H , and the corresponding Nomarski images of whole cells in A , C , E , and G . One centimeter equals - 5 , um . as class B vps mutants ( Banta et al . , 1988 ) . Class B mutant cells had a large number of small vacuolar compart - ments that were visible by Nomarski optics and by staining with either ALP or 60 - kDa V - ATPase subunit antibodies ( Figure 2 ) . Quinacrine accumulated in mul - tiple small compartments in all of the class B mutants , suggesting that functional V - ATPase was assembled onto the membranes of the fragmented vacuoles . How - ever , in certain class B mutants ( vps4l ; Figure 2H ) , the diffuse appearance of the V - ATPase staining pattern may indicate a partial defect in the assembly of the V - ATPase . Mutants representing five complementation groups were designated class B ( Table 3 ) . One mutant complementation group originally designated as class B , vpsl ( Banta et al . , 1988 ) , was similar to class B mutants but appeared to have a distinct phenotype as described in a later section . Within the class B group of mutants , there appeared to be two subgroups . The many small vacuoles in vps5 and vpsl 7 mutants retained the wild - type characteristic of clustering within one region of the cell ( Figure 2 , A - D ) . Inspection of a large number of labeled cells revealed that vacuole fragments in these mutants were often aligned along the mother cell to bud axis in a configu - ration reminiscent of wild - type vacuolar segregation structures . In contrast , the fragmented vacuoles in vps39 , vps4l , and vps43 class B mutants appeared to be ran - domly dispersed throughout the cell ( Figure 2 , E - H ) . The class B vps mutants secreted a consistently high level of newly synthesized CPY ( Table 3 ) . Class C vps Mutants Lack Coherent Vacuoles Mutants from four vps complementation groups did not possess an organized vacuole ( Table 3 ) . These class C vps mutants ( Banta et al . , 1988 ) have been the subject of several investigations ( Chvatchko et al . , 1986 ; Banta et al . , 1988 , 1990 ; Dulic and Reizman , 1989 ; Wada et al . , 1990 ; Woolford et al . , 1990 ; Robinson et al . , 1991 ; Preston et al . , 1991 ) . ALP staining of the class C mutants yielded a scattered punctate pattern ( Figure 3B ) , sug - gesting that this integral membrane protein may be dis - tributed among the multiple vesicle - like structures seen in electron micrographs of these mutants ( Chvatchko et al . , 1986 ; Banta et al . , 1988 ; Rothman et al . , 1989a ; Klionsky et al . , 1990 ; Wada et al . , 1990 ; Woolford et al . , 1990 ) . No cell surface staining with the ALP antibody was apparent , indicating that the majority of this vac - uolar membrane protein remains sequestered intracel - lularly . The steady - state level of ALP in class C mutants was comparable with that seen in wild - type cells , as determined by quantitative Western blot analysis . Thus , the reduced fluorescence intensity of the ALP - specific signal in class C mutants relative to other cells was probably a consequence of its highly dispersed intra - cellular distribution . The staining pattern of the 60 - kDa V - ATPase subunit was diffuse ( Figure 3D ) . The subtle differences between certain class B vps mutants ( Figure 2 , E - H ; vps39 , vps4l , and vps43 ) and the class C mutants ( Figure 3 ) observed by indirect immunofluorescence us - ing ALP and 60 - kDa V - ATPase subunit antibodies are more readily apparent using electron microscopic tech - niques ( Banta et al . , 1988 ) . As reported previously , all four of the class C vps mutants are strongly defective for CPY sorting ( Table 3 ) . Molecular Biology of the Cell 1394 Vacuolar Morphology in Yeast vps Mutants Table 3 .

The pairs of numbers are the percentage of newly synthesized material secreted from the MATa and MATa alleles of each vps mutant used in this study , respectively . Class D vps Mutants Display Defects in Vacuole Inheritance and Acidification of the Vacuole The class D vps mutants have been found to exhibit defects in several aspects of vacuole assembly . Two members of this group ( vps3 and vps6 ) initially attracted interest because they were unable to generate a pH gra - dient across the vacuolar membrane , and they failed to assemble peripheral membrane subunits of the V - ATPase onto the cytoplasmic surface of the vacuole ( Rothman et al . , 1989b ) . The latter phenotype is illus - trated for vps45 in Figure 4D , where antibodies for the 60 - kDa V - ATPase subunit , which is present at wild - type levels , produced a diffuse cytoplasmic staining pattern . Further characterization of vps3 and vps34 mu - tants revealed that these mutants are also defective for vacuole inheritance ( Herman and Emr , 1990 ; Raymond et al . , 1990 ) . The vacuoles in the mother cells of class D vps mutants appeared as single large spheres that failed to form segregation structures ( Figure 4 , B and F ) . Buds appeared to receive little or no vacuolar material from mother cells , and antibodies against ALP some - times produced dispersed punctate staining patterns in daughter cells , similar to class C cells ( Raymond et al . , 1990 ) . This suggests that nascent vacuolar material pro - duced in these cells transiently accumulates as unfused vesicles . The fact that nearly all mother cells possess vacuoles raises the possibility that vacuoles can arise de novo from unassembled vacuole precursors within daughter cells . Mutants from eight vps complementation groups dis - played class D phenotypes . Independent screens pro - duced four additional vacuole segregation ( vac ) mutants with defects in vacuole inheritance ( Weisman et al . , 1990 ; Shaw and Wickner , 1991 ; Weisman and Wickner , 1992 ) . However , complementation testing between vac and vps mutants identified vacl as vpsl9 , vac3 as vps36 , and vac4 as vpsl5 . Within the class D vps strains there appeared to be subgroups of mutants with somewhat distinct charac - teristics . Yeast strains carrying vps3 , vps6 , vps9 , vps2l , or vps45 mutations had phenotypes indistinguishable from those of vps3A strains described previously ( Figure 4 , A - D ) ( Raymond et al . , 1990 ) . The morphological phenotypes of vpsl5 and vps34 mutants ( Figure 4 , E - H ) , although indistinguishable from one another , were slightly different from other class D mutants . In addition to vacuolar membrane staining , antibodies against ALP yielded punctate cytoplasmic labeling in almost all vps15 and vps34 cells , and the percentage of ( daughter ) cells that lacked apparent vacuoles and had a class C - like staining pattern was several - fold higher than in other class D mutants ( Figure 4F ) . These data are consistent with the interpretation that ALP is present in the mem - branes of the multiple vesicular bodies seen in electron micrographs of these mutants ( Banta et al . , 1988 ) . Fur - thermore , antibodies that recognize the 60 - kDa V - ATPase subunit labeled the vacuolar membrane and the cytoplasm in vpsl5 and vps34 strains , indicating that the V - ATPase assembly defect in these mutants was less pronounced than in other class D strains ( compare Figure 4 , D and H ) . In support of this , measurements of V - ATPase specific activities in isolated vacuolar membranes prepared from vps34 strains were 20 - 40 % of the wild - type levels , significantly higher than the levels measured in vps3 and vps6 mutants ( Rothman et al . , 1989b ; Yamashiro , 1990 ) . The similarity between vpsl5 and vps34 mutants is consistent with the finding that Vpsl5p and Vps34p interact physically and that genetic interaction between these genes has been ob - served ( Herman et al . , 1991 ) . All of the class D vps mu - tants secreted high percentages of newly synthesized Vol . 3 , December 1992 1395 C . K . Raymond et al . B _ _ uoles of class E vps mutants were relatively normal in appearance ( Figure 5 , A and B ) . Antibodies specific for the 60 - kDa V - ATPase subunit revealed some vacuolar and diffuse staining , but the majority of protein ap - peared to be sequestered in a separate compartment ( termed the " class E compartment " ) that was distinct from the vacuole ( Figure 5 , C and D ) . Two lines of ev - idence suggested that the extravacuolar 60 - kDa V - ATPase subunit was part of active V - ATPase complexes that were clustered around the class E compartment . First , quinacrine accumulated in the vacuole at low lev - DrvS ^ | B l i I B l I _ els , but very high levels accumulated in the smaller class E compartment ( s ) adjacent to the vacuole ( Figure 6 , A and B ) . Quinacrine labeling of the extravacuolar com - partment in class E vps mutants was sensitive to the addition of 200 mM ammonium acetate ( Raymond , 1990 ) , suggesting that quinacrine accumulated in the extravacuolar compartment because it was acidified ( Weisman et al . , 1987 ; Rothman et al . , 1989b ) . Second , the V - ATPase specific activities measured in membranes prepared from several class E mutants were very similar to the specific activity measured in wild - type mem - branes ( Yamashiro , 1990 ; Yamashiro , Rothman , and Stevens , unpublished observation ) . The distinct distributions of ALP and the 60 - kDa V - ATPase subunit in class E cells suggested that the novel class E compartment defined by the V - ATPase may represent exaggerated prevacuolar or endosome - like organelles . This hypothesis was investigated further by examining the distribution of a membrane protein of i ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ Figure 2 .

The late - Golgi marker was an in - tegral membrane fusion protein that carries the cytoplasmic tail of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase A ( DPAP A ) fused to the transmembrane and lumenal domains of ALP ( A - ALP ) . This protein was shown to reside in Figure 5 . The class E mutant vps27 ( vpI23 - 5 ) possesses a novel 60 - kDa V - ATPase subunit stained organelle distinct from the ALP staining vacuole .

In class E mutants , a significant portion of the A - ALP fusion protein was lo - calized to the novel class E compartment , as demon - strated in the double - label immunofluorescence images shown in Figure 7 , A - C .

The distribution of the A - ALP fusion construct is revealed by ALP antibodies in B . Note that the yeast strain shown is a vps27Apho8A double mutant ( Table 1 ) , and thus the endogenous vacuolar signal from ALP is absent . CPY staining is shown in E .

The soluble vacuolar proteins proteinase A ( PrA ) and proteinase B were also found in the novel class E organelle . The observations presented in Figure 7 indicate that the novel class E compartment possesses marker proteins of both the late - Golgi and the vacuole , consistent with the interpretation that it is an exaggerated prevacuolar organelle . Mutants from thirteen vps complementation groups exhibited a class E phenotype ( Table 3 ) . All of the class E vps mutants secreted modest amounts of newly syn - thesized CPY ( Table 3 ) . Vacuoles in Class F vps Mutants are Encircled by Smaller Vacuolar Compartments Mutants from two vps complementation groups , vpsl and vps26 , have vacuolar morphologies intermediate between wild - type cells and the vacuolar morphology of class B mutants ( Figure 8 ) ; vpsl mutants were , in fact , originally described as class B mutant strains ( Banta et al . , 1988 ) . Unlike class B strains , however , cells in both class F mutants typically contain a large central vacuole ( Figure 8 , A and C ) . The labeling pattern of ALP and 60 - kDa V - ATPase subunit reveal that this central com - partment is often surrounded by smaller vacuole - like compartments ( Figure 8 , B and D ) . Although segregation structures are seldom observed in vpsl and vps26 cells , large buds contain vacuoles indicating that vacuole in - heritance occurs in these strains . The observations that the 60 - kDa subunit is assembled onto membranes and that vacuoles from both mutants label with quinacrine ( Banta et al . , 1988 ; Rothman et al . , 1989b ) suggest that V - ATPase assembly is not influenced by the vpsl or the vps26 mutations . Both class F mutants exhibited severe CPY sorting defects ( Table 3 ) . DISCUSSION Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was used to characterize the vacuolar morphology in vps mutants representing 41 complementation groups . As with pre - vious studies ( Banta et al . , 1988 ; Rothman et al . , 1989a ) , we encountered vps mutants that exhibited profound perturbations in vacuole assembly , and we found that groups of mutants from different complementation groups shared similar aberrant morphological pheno - types . However , the major conclusion drawn in the previous reports was that majority of vps mutants had wild - type class A vacuoles . The greater resolution of the analytical tools utilized in this study indicates that many of the mutants originally placed in the class A group have vacuoles that are significantly different from the wild - type organelle . Once again , groups of mutants from different complementation groups were found to Molecular Biology of the Cell 1398 Vacuolar Morphology in Yeast vps Mutants l Figure 8 . Vacuole - like compartments cluster around a central vac - uoles in the class F mutant vpsl ( SF838 - 9D vpsl - . 2 ) . ALP staining is shown in B , 60 - kDa V - ATPase subunit staining in D , and the corre - sponding Nomarski images of whole cells in A and C . One centimeter equals ' - 5 , um . share similar traits , and so the class A , class B , and so on , nomenclature of Banta et al . ( 1988 ) was extended to include these new groups . Overall , six classes of dis - tinct morphological phenotype could be differentiated among mutants of the 41 vps complementation groups ( Table 4 ) . Quantitative analysis of the CPY missorting defects in the same collection of mutants suggests there was , in most cases , a good correlation between mor - phological phenotype and the severity of the sorting defect within a given class of vps mutants . Our findings represent a significant contribution to - ward understanding vacuolar biogenesis in S . cerevisiae and thus to the more general problem of organelle as - sembly in eukaryotic cells . The analysis presented here demonstrates that most vps mutants can be differen - tiated from their isogenic wild - type parents based on morphological phenotypes and that groups of mutants appear to share similar aberrant characteristics . Many of the phenotypic features of individual class A , B , C , D , and F vps mutants have been described previously ( reviewed in Klionsky et al . , 1990 ; Raymond et al . , 1992a ) , but an overview of the entire vps mutant col - lection that accounted for newly discovered morpho - logical phenotypes ( e . g . , class D , E , and F phenotypes ) had not been conducted . An important conclusion drawn from the current analysis is that this large col - lection of vps mutants can be subdivided into a relatively small number of morphological groups . The fact that there are at least six distinct classes of vps mutants sug - gests there also may be at least six " pathways " or distinct biochemical " processes " required for vacuolar protein sorting and vacuole assembly . As a corollary , the wild - type gene products affected in mutants that share similar phenotypes may act in the same pathway . This is ex - emplified by the vpsl5 and vps34 mutants . These mu - tants share identical vacuolar morphologies , and the wild - type Vpsl5p and Vps34p products appear to act as a complex ( Herman et al . , 1991 ) . The other significant aspect of this work is that the morphological characteristics of a given mutant suggest possible functions for corresponding wild - type gene products . For example , mutations that specifically affect the soluble protein sorting apparatus would not be an - ticipated to perturb other events in vacuole assembly , and , thus , such mutants might be expected to have a class A phenotype . Mutations in a putative soluble vac - uolar protein sorting receptor complex eventually may be identified among the class A vps mutants , particularly those with a pronounced sorting defect . In class B mutants there are many small vacuolar compartments , and in class C mutants there are no ap - parent vacuoles , yet no cell surface ALP staining was observed in these classes ( or any other class ) of vps mu - tants . These data underscore the fundamental differ - ences between the sorting of soluble and integral mem - brane vacuolar proteins . Recent evidence suggests that membrane proteins lacking specific sorting information are delivered to the vacuole by default ( Roberts , 1991 ; Cooper and Bussey , 1992 ; Raymond et al . , 1992a , b ; Roberts et al . , 1992 ; Wilcox et al . , 1992 ) . The fact that none of the vps mutations results in delivery of ALP to the cell surface , even in class C mutants , which have an extreme vacuole assembly phenotype , supports this conclusion . The phenotype of class E vps mutants , which accu - mulate a novel compartment with protein constituents from both the late Golgi and the vacuole , has not been described previously . These mutants secrete modest amounts of newly synthesized CPY in its precursor form , and the CPY that is retained intracellularly is pro - cessed to its mature form ( see Rothman and Stevens , 1986 ; Robinson et al . , 1988 ; Vater , Raymond , and Ste - vens , unpublished observations ) . Because a large pool of CPY was found within the novel class E compart - ment , by inference this material is in its processed en - zymatically active form . This supposition is supported by the fact that the A - ALP fusion protein , which con - tains a C - terminal propeptide segment that is proteo - lytically cleaved by vacuolar hydrolases ( Klionsky and Emr , 1989 ) , partially localizes to the class E compart - ment and is partially processed in the class E mutant vps27 ( Raymond , Nothwehr , and Stevens , unpublished data ) . These data argue that the class E compartment is a post - Golgi organelle and not an exaggerated form of the late Golgi because only p2 precursor form of CPY Vol . 3 , December 1992 1399 C . K . Raymond et al . Table 4 . Phenotypic characteristics of the morphological groups that define the vps mutants Class Characteristics Class A Wild - type vacuolar morphology . Vacuoles frequently appear as 3 - 10 subcompartments that cluster to one region of the cytoplasm . In premitotic budding cells , the vacuole is likely to extend between mother cell and developing bud along the cell axis . ALP and V - ATPase staining patterns of the vacuole are superimposable . Class B Mutants have highly " fragmented " vacuoles exhibiting > 20 vacuole - like compartments per cell . In some mutants , these subcompartments are clustered , whereas in others they are distributed randomly throughout the cell . ALP and V - ATPase staining does not appear particularly discrete , owing in part to the dispersed nature of the vacuole - like compartments . Quinacrine staining in the class B vps mutants sugests that some active V - ATPase complexes are assembled . Class C Mutant cells do not have an organelle readily identifiable as a vacuole . Multiple impressions visible by Nomarski optics are presumably a mixture of vesicle - like organelles and lipid droplets seen previously in electron microscopy studies ( Banta et al . , 1988 ; Wada et al . , 1990 ) . ALP staining is distinctly punctate , suggesting that this membrane protein is distributed among vesicle - like membrane compartments . V - ATPase staining is more diffuse , suggesting that class C mutants are at least partially defective for the assembly of the V - ATPase . Class D These mutants are defective for vacuolar segregation , meaning mother cells have a large , single , spherical vacuolar compartment that fails to extend into developing buds , and newly formed daughter cells often lack coherent vacuoles and assume the appearance of class C mutants ( Raymond et al . , 1990 ; Weisman et al . , 1990 ; Shaw and Wickner , 1991 ) . The V - ATPase fails to assemble properly onto the vacuolar membrane , resulting in diffuse cytoplasmic localization of peripheral membrane V - ATPase subunits . Class E ALP antibodies label vacuoles that are readily visible by Nomarski optics , whereas V - ATPase antibodies label a prominent organelle distinct for the vacuole and from ALP staining structures ; V - ATPase labeling is also weakly evident around the ALP - staining vacuole and as diffuse staining throughout the cytoplasm . Significant portions of soluble vacuolar hydrolases ( CPY and PrA ) and Golgi membrane proteins ( DPAP A and A - ALP ) also localize to the novel organelle in class E mutants . These data indicate that class E mutants may possess an exaggerated form of a prevacuolar endosome - like compartment . Class F These mutants often have a large central vacuole surrounded by a number of class B - like fragmented vacuolar structures . As such , these mutants exhibit vacuolar morphology distinct from class A and class B cells . ALP and V - ATPase antibodies yield superimposable staining patterns . is secreted , yet mature CPY is present in this novel com - partment . Class E vps mutants possess two distinct organelles with vacuolar markers , and the question arises as to which organelle is the vacuole and how these separate compartments are generated . The large organelle that is apparent by Nomarski optics and that also stains with ALP antibodies has the appearance normally associated with a yeast vacuole . On the other hand , the new com - partment has active V - ATPase complexes and large pools of active vacuolar hydrolases associated with it . We envision at least two models for how these com - partments are generated ( Figure 9 ) . In the first model , proteins sorted to a common vacuolar compartment in wild - type cells enter one of ( at least ) two separate sorting pathways ( Figure 9A ) . These pathways converge in the vacuole in wild - type cells . In class E mutants , these pathways fail to merge and lead to the generation of separate compartments . To accomodate experimental observations , it is also necessary to postulate that late Golgi proteins ( e . g . , A - ALP ) enter one of these divergent pathways as a consequence of the class E vps mutation . In the second model , proteins sorted in the late Golgi and bound for the vacuole enter a prevacuolar or en - dosome - like compartment . Furthermore , proteins that function in the late Golgi are hypothesized to enter the prevacuolar compartment , and in wild - type cells , these proteins are recycled back to the Golgi . Vacuolar pro - teins , on the other hand , are transported from the class E compartment to the vacuole . In class E vps mutants , protein traffic from the prevacuolar endosome - like or - ganelle is restricted for most of these proteins . This leads to the accumulation of proteins in the prevacuolar com - partment and the morphological exaggeration of the or - ganelle itself . We cannot , at present , distinguish between these models . However , evidence has been presented that wild - type cells possess a distinct compartment along the endocytic pathway ( Singer and Riezman , 1990 ) . Two additional observations lead us to favor the in - terpretation that the class E compartment is a preva - cuolar endosome - like organelle . Antibodies directed against Vpslp , which is thought to associate with the yeast Golgi but does not appear to associate with vac - uolar membranes ( Raymond , 1990 ; Rothman et al . , 1990 ) , label the class E organelle ( Raymond and Stevens , unpublished observations ) . In addition , the a - factor re - ceptor , Ste3p , which is endocytosed from the cell surface and delivered to the vacuole in wild - type strains , ac - cumulates in the prevacuolar endosome - like organelle of the class E mutant vps2 ( Davis and Sprague , personal communication ) . The fact that there are 13 class E vps complementation groups indicates that a large number of components are required for conversion of the class E organelle into normal wild - type vacuoles . In summary , our work has shown that the large col - lection of vps mutants is composed of subclasses of mu - tant strains that share similar morphological phenotypes and CPY sorting defects . These data support a model Molecular Biology of the Cell 1400 Vacuolar Morphology in Yeast vps Mutants Wild - type A late Golgi Class E vps ALP flat Goli Ca vacuole L ~ ~ ~ ~ ( ALP ) late Golgi Class E compartment B Wild - type Class E vps Class E fl \ compartment II vacuol ~ e - Il vacuol AP . CPY ) ( AP late Golgi late Golgi Figure 9 . Two models for the formation of the new compartment in class E vps mutants . ( A ) Proteins bound for the vacuole in wild - type cells are normally packaged into at least two separate classes of transport vesicles that subsequently fuse with the vacuole . In class E mutants , these pathways fail to merge . In addition , late Golgi proteins such as A - ALP enter the pathway defined by CPY as a consequence of the class E vps mutation . ( B ) Proteins bound for the vacuole in wild - type cells normally pass through a prevacuolar endosome - like compartment . Late Golgi proteins are hypothesized to cycle between the late Golgi compartment and the prevacuole . In class E mutants , most protein traffic ( an exception being ALP ) from the putative en - dosome - like organelle either to the vacuole or back to the late Golgi is restricted , leading to morphological exaggeration of the organelle . The steady - state resident proteins for each compartment are shown in parenthesis . in which the different classes of mutants affect specific and discrete processes , pathways , or steps required for vacuole biogenesis . Similarly , mutants with indistin - guishable morphological phenotypes are likely to act along the same or similar vacuole assembly pathway . These observations should facilitate the choices of VPS genes that are subjected to further molecular charac - terization . Finally , we have discovered that a large number of class E vps mutants possess a novel organelle that contains proteins from the late Golgi , the vacuole and a protein endocytosed from the cell surface . These are the characteristics expected of a prevacuolar en - dosomal compartment , and they support previous ev - idence that wild - type yeast cells possess endosomes ( Singer and Riezman , 1990 ) .
