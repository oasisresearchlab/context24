Pathophysiological consequences of VEGF - induced vascular permeability Sara M . Weis 1 & David A . Cheresh 1 Although vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) induces angiogenesis , it also disrupts vascular barrier function in diseased tissues . Accordingly , VEGF expression in cancer and ischaemic disease has unexpected pathophysiological consequences . By uncoupling endothelial cell – cell junctions VEGF causes vascular permeability and oedema , resulting in extensive injury to ischaemic tissues after stroke or myocardial infarction . In cancer , VEGF - mediated disruption of the vascular barrier may potentiate tumour cell extravasation , leading to widespread metastatic disease . Therefore , by blocking the vascular permeability promoting effects of VEGF it may be feasible to reduce tissue injury after ischaemic disease and minimize the invasive properties of circulating tumour cells . T he VEGF family includes VEGF - A , placenta growth factor , VEGF - B , VEGF - C and VEGF - D . VEGF - A ( hereafter referred to as VEGF ) is a key regulator of normal and pathological blood vessel growth . VEGF was ﬁrst described as a vascular permeability factor ( VPF ) by Dvorak and colleagues 1 . In the ensuing 20 years , a large body of research has evolved characterizing the molecular pathways that mediate the distinct biological activities of VEGF once bound to its cell - surface receptors VEGFR1 ( also known as Flt - 1 ) , VEGFR2 ( also known as Flk - 1 / KDR ) and neuropilin - 1 / 2 ( NP1 / NP2 ) 2 . Previous studies 3 , 4 have shown that targeted deletion of VEGF in mice leads to abnormal vascular development and embryo - nic lethality , emphasizing the critical role for VEGF in blood vessel development . A recent review 5 portrays the history of VEGF - A / VPF and the discoveries leading to the development and clinical approval of the anti - VEGF antibody bevacizumab to target tumour angiogenesis . The VEGF family of growth factors is unique , as it comprises the only angiogenic factor that also potently induces vascular leak . Although VEGF - induced angiogenesis is often accompanied by a vascular permeability response , VEGF - induced vascular leak is not required for angiogenesis 6 . VEGF - mediated vascular permeability leads to accumulation of a ﬁbrin barrier around tumours and wounds 7 , which may limit the malignant properties of these tissues . However , it has become clear that the vascular permeability - produ - cing effects of VEGF may have profound negative consequences in ischaemic disease by augmenting the level of infarcted tissue 8 , 9 . Aside from the pathological effects of VEGF - mediated vascular per - meability , it is unclear how this process contributes to normal physiology after development . In addition , potential strategies to treat cancer and ischaemic disease may beneﬁt from a better under - standing of VEGF - induced vascular leak . Thus , it is important to understand the molecular mechanisms leading to VEGF - induced permeability in both physiological and pathological states . Although many studies have focused on the role that VEGF plays as an angiogenic factor , this review will primarily discuss the vascular permeability - promoting effects of VEGF and the effects of hyper - permeability on the pathophysiology of disease . VEGF induces vascular leak Deﬁning vascular permeability . Vascular permeabilitycan be simply deﬁned as the movement of ﬂuids and molecules between the vascular and extravascular compartments . Interestingly , vascular permeability can be regulated by VEGF as well as a wide array of inﬂammatory mediators . However , experimental evidence suggests that the vascular leak induced by VEGF and inﬂammatory mediators occurs via distinct molecular processes 10 . In any event , the process of vascular leak is quite complex , and depends on a number of variables ( see Fig . 1 ) , including the physical properties of the ﬂuid or molecule being transported ( size , charge , conﬁguration ) , gradients between compartments ( pressure or concentration ) and the mode of trans - port ( through channels or vesicles within an individual cell or through interendothelial junctions between adjacent cells ) . Very little macromolecular transport may occur despite high permeability if pressure gradients limit extravasation 11 . Molecules of various sizes may extravasate by distinct means , with different kinetics , and with varying degrees of clearance by lymphatics 12 . Mechanisms of vascular leak . Ultrastructural studies have offered insight into how endothelial cells respond to VEGF during the vascular permeability response . Endothelial cells exposed to VEGF allow passage of particles of different sizes by a variety of physical mechanisms ( Fig . 1 ) . Roberts and Palade 13 discovered that VEGF can induce the formation of fenestrations , or small pores , in the thin endothelial cell cytoplasm , allowing leak of small solutes . VEGF also induces formation of caveolae 14 , small plasmalemmal invaginations , which allow vesicular transport of small proteins through the cytoplasm of a single endothelial cell . Feng et al . 15 coined the term vesiculo - vacuolar organelles ( VVOs ) to describe the fusion of vesicles to form a channel through the endothelial cytoplasm . These mech - anisms may provide a physical pathway for very small solutes to pass through a single endothelial cell , but the leak of larger proteins probably occurs at the intercellular junctions between adjacent endothelial cells . One study investigated the functional limits of transvascular transport , and deﬁned pore cutoff sizes ranging from 200 nm to 1 . 2 m m in vessels associated with subcutaneous tumours 16 . Furthermore , the size and number of these junctional gaps and pores are affected by VEGF in a dose - dependent manner that varies between vascular beds , suggesting different dose thresholds for VEGF in different tissues or tumour types 17 . These studies suggest that precise levels of exogenous VEGF could be used to manipulate the vascular barrier and enhance delivery of anti - tumour agents .

Vol 437 | 22 September 2005 | doi : 10 . 1038 / nature03987 497 © 2005 Nature Publishing Group When endothelial cell – cell junctional integrity is disrupted in vivo , the consequence is leak of serum / plasma proteins and circulating cells from the blood vessels ( Fig . 2 ) . Oedema is the accumulation of ﬂuids in the extracellular space , and is associated with deleterious swelling and increased interstitial pressure . Sites of vascular leak where underlying basement membrane is exposed can attract plate - lets 9 or even tumour cells 18 to a potential site for adhesion or transendothelial migration . Platelets attracted to these sites of dis - ruption bind to von Willebrand factor , ﬁbronectin or underlying collagen , leading to their activation . These activated platelets often deposit high levels of VEGF 19 , thus creating more leak and attracting more platelets . The aggregating platelets attracted to the initial exposed gap between endothelial cells may quickly occlude a small vessel and cause localized ischaemia , which may further induce VEGF expression and endothelial gaps . Experimental evaluation of permeability . A number of methods have been used to evaluate the process of vascular permeability in response to a variety of permeability - inducing agents ( Table 1 ) . Each model has advantages and limitations , and ultimately yields an ‘indicator of permeability’ dependent upon the physical conﬁgur - ation of the experiment . The fundamental differences between the various in vitro assays are evident in their ability to detect the earliest signiﬁcant response to a particular permeability factor . For example , the vascular leak response to thrombin ranges from 5 min to 2 h ( refs20 , 21 ) , whereasVEGF is from 2to 6 h ( refs22 , 23 ) . These invitro models are limited by the fact that permeability is typically evaluated on a single cell type , in a non - physiological two - dimensional con - formation , without vascular ﬂow or pressure , and in the absence of circulating cells . In addition , endothelial cells isolated from different vascular beds exhibit varying levels of responsiveness to VEGF 24 . Nevertheless , these models provide an opportunity to study time - and dose - dependent permeability responses in cells subjected to pharmacological inhibitors , gene silencing , or expressing genetic mutations . The most commonly used in vivo assay to evaluate vascular permeability in vivo is the Miles assay 25 ( Table 1 ) , which is often used to quantify vascular leak in the skin or the ear , and more recently in the lung 26 . The Miles assay may be inappropriate to measure permeability changes in response to VEGF , because the measured solute ﬂux is inﬂuenced by diffusive permeability , surface area , hydraulic conductivity , capillary pressure and interstitial pressure 27 . Unfortunately , VEGF is likely to increase solute ﬂux by changing most of these parameters , possibly independently of its direct effect on permeability . Microscopy techniques have commonly been used to localize extravasation of macromolecular tracers of different sizes , which are labelled with heavy metals , radioisotopes , ﬂuorescence or horse - radish peroxidase . These techniques use intravital microscopy to monitor leak from single , isolated vessels or intact vascular beds from exteriorized thin tissues such as mesentery , or via window prep - arations such as the dorsal skin fold model . These methods have been used to illustrate vascular leak and oedema in the brain 10 , inﬂam - mation 28 and tumour - associated blood vessels 29 . In particular , trans - mission electron microscopy has been used to evaluate endothelial barrier properties and extravasation of ferritin in blood vessels after VEGF administration 15 . Similarly , we have observed extravasation of red blood cells from coronary capillaries after myocardial infarction or systemic VEGF administration 9 ( Fig . 2 ) . VEGF receptor - mediated signalling pathways Contribution of VEGF receptors . VEGF - mediated intracellular signals mediate the distinct activities of VEGF , including cell survival , proliferation , migration , vascular permeability and angiogenesis . Figure 1 | Structural determinantsof VEGF - induced leak . VEGF can induce leak of various - sized solutes via several routes through the endothelium , including by diffusion , interendothelial junctions , fenestrae , caveolae or VVOs . Hyperpermeability ultimately depends upon relative pressure gradients between the vascular and extravascular compartments , and thus a hyperpermeable vessel may not be ‘leaky’ if interstitial pressure is high relative to microvascular pressure . Normalization of hyperpermeable tumour - associated vessels ( with bevacizumab , for example ) is thought to improve drug delivery by facilitating a more homogeneous distribution of chemotherapy agents .

REVIEWS NATURE | Vol 437 | 22 September 2005 498 © 2005 Nature Publishing Group Although VEGF receptors were originally thought to be expressed solely on endothelial cells , the tissue distribution of VEGF receptors now includes vascular smooth muscle cells 30 , osteoblasts 31 , cardiac myocytes 32 , myoﬁbroblasts 33 , neurons 34 and various tumour cells 35 . In endothelial cells , VEGFR2 localization may determine speciﬁc signalling events after VEGF stimulation . For example , VEGFR2 associated with cadherins at cell – cell junctions 9 may facilitate the vascular permeability response , whereas VEGFR2 associated with a v integrins 36 ( a v b 3 and a v b 5 ) at the cell – matrix interface may inﬂu - ence permeability as well as angiogenesis ( Fig . 3 ) . Downstream signalling by VEGF is quite diverse , and includes transduction molecules such as phosphatidylinositol - 3 - OH kinase ( PI ( 3 ) K ) / Akt , Ras / Raf / MEK / Erk , Src and phospholipase C g ( PLC - g ) / endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) . A wide array of factors has been implicated in the VEGF - induced permeability response , some of which are discussed below and illustrated in Fig . 3 . Cooperation with a v integrins . Growth factor receptor signalling is known to coordinate with that of integrins . There is a growing body of evidence that VEGF receptors and integrins are physically and functionally linked and may inﬂuence communication between cells and their underlying extracellular matrix . VEGF signalling in vivo seems to depend on integrin a v b 5 , because anti - a v b 5 , and to a lesser extent anti - a v b 3 , blocks the angiogenic response induced by VEGF 37 . In contrast , anti - a v b 3 but not anti - a v b 5 blocks basic ﬁbroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) - mediated angiogenesis 37 . However , distinct downstream effects of VEGF may be differentially regulated by these integrins , as b 5 - null mice show little or no vascular leak in response to VEGF 38 , whereas b 3 - null mice show an increased vascular leak response 39 . Together , these ﬁndings emphasize that VEGF signalling depends on cooperation between growth factor receptors and par - ticular integrins , and highlights the speciﬁcity of these relationships in terms of downstream activities . There is biochemical evidence that the extracellular domain of a v b 3 integrin associates with VEGFR2 in cultured cells and inﬂuences cell migration and proliferation 40 . It is possible that the relationship between b 3 and VEGFR2 provides negative regulation of VEGF signalling . In fact , mice lacking b 3 integrin exhibit increased VEGFR2 expression and are more respon - sive to VEGF in terms of angiogenesis 41 and vascular leak 39 , which may explain the increased tumour growth and metastasis observed in these mice 36 . VEGF modulates cell – cell junctions . VEGF receptors may also have a critical role in cell – cell adhesion and communication through their direct interaction with cell – cell adhesion molecules ( Fig . 3 ) . In endothelial cells , VEGFR2 associates with vascular endothelial ( VE ) - cadherin and provides regulation of cell – cell junctional integ - rity 9 , and represents a mechanism for localized disruption by VEGF . In normal mouse cardiac blood vessels we have identiﬁed a pre - formed complex between VEGFR2 and VE - cadherin that rapidly and transiently dissociates in response to VEGF stimulation 9 . After ischaemic injury of the heart or brain , gaps can be seen between theendothelialcellsliningsmallbloodvesselsinthesetissues 9 ( Fig . 2 ) . The integrity of endothelial cell – cell junctions and vascular barrier function is regulated by a series of adhesion molecules that make up tight , gap and adherens junctions 42 ( Fig . 3 ) . These gaps must be large enough for the extravasation of red blood cells , and probably involve disruption of some or all of these junctional proteins . VEGF blocks gap junctional communication between adjacent endothelial cells by altering connexin - 43 phosphorylation via VEGFR2 and Src kinase activation 43 . VEGF also disrupts tight junctions by altering phos - phorylation of zonula occluden - 1 ( ZO - 1 ) and occludin 44 through a Src - dependent pathway 45 . Several adherens junction proteins ( VE - cadherin , b - catenin , g - catenin / plakoglobin and p120 - catenin ) become tyrosine phosphorylated downstream of VEGFR2 after VEGF stimulation 22 , leading to the loosening of cell – cell contacts between endothelial cells in vitro . In vivo , disruption of VE - cadherin with a function - blocking antibody leads to vascular leak and haem - orrhage 46 . We have recently demonstrated that Src or Yes kinase activity is required for VEGF - induced phosphorylation of these adherens junction proteins , which leads to vascular leak in vivo , as mice deﬁcient in either of these kinases show a complete loss of VEGF - mediated vascular permeability 9 . Previous in vitro studies have shown that pharmacological Src inhibition can block per - meability and VE - cadherin tyrosine phosphorylation induced by hydrogen peroxide 47 or TNF - a 48 . Recently , a role for Src - dependent VE - cadherin tyrosine phosphorylation downstream of VEGF in blood vessels and cultured endothelial cells has been conﬁrmed 49 . This requirement for Src activity may be a phenomenon shared by other growth factor – cadherin pairs , because N - cadherin – bFGF - R 50 and E - cadherin – epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) 51 rep - resent similar signalling complexes that transduce signals upon Table 1 | Methods to evaluate vascular permeability in vitro and in vivo Model type Description Advantages Limitations In vitro models Boyden chamber / Transwell assay Conﬂuent endothelial cell monolayer seeded onto porous ﬁlter in upper chamber .

A similar signalling pathway may regulate the epithelial – mesenchymal transition in tumour cells , in which EGF - R - mediated Src kinase activity initiates the dissociation of E - cadherin - mediated cell – cell adhesion 52 . This signalling mechanism might then allow migration of individual tumour cells from a primary tumour during local invasion or distant metastasis . Alteration of cadherin - mediated cell – cell adhesion is often corre - lated with changes in tyrosine phosphorylation of both cadherins and catenins , which alters barrier function bydisrupting the bridge of proteins linking adherens junctions to the actin cytoskeleton . Phos - phorylation of a single tyrosine residue in b - catenin ( Y654 ) 53 or p120 ( Y217 ) 54 regulates their interaction with E - cadherin . Classical cad - herins , including VE - cadherin , have several tyrosine phosphoryl - ation sites within their cytoplasmic domain . In the N - cadherin cytoplasmic tail , mutation of Y833 decreases phosphorylation of N - cadherin by Src 55 . The presence of protein tyrosine phosphatases ( PTPs ) at the adherens junction may also regulate phosphorylation status of cadherins and catenins ( Fig . 3 ) . Indeed , PTP1B 56 , PTP m 57 , VE - PTP 58 , DEP - 1 ( ref . 59 ) and SHP - 2 ( ref . 60 ) have been shown to inﬂuence cadherin – catenin interaction and intercellular adhesion . In fact , the latter two PTPs participate in signalling complexes with VEGFR2 ( refs 59 , 61 ) . A variety of other signalling pathways initiated by VEGF and VEGFR2 may contribute to vascular leak ( Fig . 3 ) . For example , inhibitors of eNOS , PLC - g , or protein kinase C can each block VEGF - induced permeability 62 . In addition , a sustained VEGF - induced permeability response is mediated by activation of the urokinase plasminogen activator and receptor system ( uPA / uPAR ) 63 . In the absence of VEGF ligand binding , VEGFR2 activation by shear stress is sufﬁcient to induce a permeability response that requires integrin signalling and results in rearrangement of adherens junction proteins 64 , 65 . VEGF activates p21 - activated kinase ( PAK ) , which locates to cell – cell junctions and is required for myosin light chain phosphorylation and cell contractility 66 . Even focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) , which has a critical role in integrin - mediated signal - ling , is required for VEGF - induced hyperpermeability 67 . Although signal transduction from kinases , phosphatases , cell – cell or cell – matrix adhesion molecules , and physical forces are each required to induce vascular leak from VEGF stimulation , it remains poorly understood how these apparently disparate signalling pathways converge to create hyperpermeability in response to VEGF . Effects of hyperpermeability in pathological states VEGF expression during ischaemic disease . VEGF is induced under a variety of circumstances in tissues . Hypoxic conditions result in the stimulation of hypoxia - inducible factors ( HIF ) , which translocate to the nucleus to bind hypoxia response elements ( HRE ) in target genes . Hypoxic stimuli during development appear to inﬂuence VEGF expression and thereby regulate vasculogenesis or angiogenesis . In embryonic tissues , hypoxia induces VEGF expression and endo - thelial cell proliferation and migration , whereas hyperoxia produces an opposite response 68 . During ischaemic injury in mature tissues , the induction of VEGF may occur through similar HIF - dependent pathways , and is associated with positive remodelling and re - vascu - larization of damaged tissues . In the brain after stroke , VEGF expression appears within 6 h in response to hypoxia along the ischaemic border zone 69 . Although it seems to be constructive in the long term—because the expression of VEGF , VEGFR2 and HIF - 1 in this hypoxic region correlates with the strong increase in the number of newly formed vessels 69 —this response may contribute to deleterious oedema formation during the acute stage 8 . The response to ischaemia is similar in the heart after myocardial infarction , as observed in the brain after stroke , wherein VEGF and Figure 3 | Signalling pathways implicated in VEGF - induced vascular permeability . Plasma or serum VEGF released from circulating cells can transmit signals from the luminal surface of the vascular endothelium . Alternatively , VEGF bound to the extracellular matrix or released from pericytes , stromal cells , or tumour cells from the abluminal surface can initiate signalling pathways , leading to vascular leak . VEGF - induced disruption of cell – cell adherens , tight and gap junctions often involves activation of Src family kinases and / or PTPs . VEGFR2 localization to these cell – cell junctions may facilitate a speciﬁc , localized response . VEGFR2 also interacts with a v integrins , which transmit cell – matrix signals and link focal adhesions to the actin cytoskeleton . REVIEWS NATURE | Vol 437 | 22 September 2005 500 © 2005 Nature Publishing Group VEGF receptor levels increase in the infarct border zone after the acute ischaemic event 70 ( Fig . 4 ) . VEGF - mediated vascular per - meability contributes to damaging oedema formation within several hours 9 , but also promotes re - vascularization and long - term cell survival . Ischaemic preconditioning preceding acute myocardial infarction is also associated with increased VEGF expression , and provides cardioprotection attributable to increased blood vessel density 71 and reduced endothelial cell apoptosis 72 . VEGF gene deliv - ery has been investigated as a therapeutic option to improve outcome after myocardial infarction . Intramyocardial injection of naked DNA encoding HIF - 1 a and VEGF 165 enhances angiogenesis and reduces infarct size in pre - clinical acute myocardial infarction models 73 . Endothelial progenitor cell mobilization or transplantation into ischaemic myocardium leads to increased VEGF expression and shows promise for enhanced cytoprotection and angiogenesis 74 . In addition , there is a synergistic effect of bone marrow mobilization and VEGFR2 gene therapy in myocardial ischaemia 75 . However , VEGF expression must be controlled as it could lead to haeman - gioma - like intravascular tumours 76 after myocardial infarction . Within hours after an acute myocardial infarction , VEGF induces gaps between adjacent endothelial cells lining the microvessels in the heart , allowing leak of serum , plasma proteins and red blood cells into the myocardium ( Fig . 2 ) , which exacerbates tissue injury and increases infarct size 9 . In fact , this leak response produces a localized tissue injury as seen in Fig . 2 . Blocking VEGF activity within the ﬁrst 6 h after ischaemic stroke reduces oedema and improves outcome 8 . VEGF - induced vascular permeability can be suppressed with block - ade of c - Src 9 , 71 , which we have shown to be necessary for VEGF signalling leading to vascular leak . Accordingly , genetic or pharma - cological Src blockade after either stroke or myocardial infarction prevents oedema , reduces infarct size and preserves ventricular function without affecting VEGF expression 9 , 10 . On the basis of this concept , a new inhibitor of VEGF - induced vascular leak is in phase I / II clinical trials for patients with acute myocardial infarction ( J . Doukas , personal communication ) . This therapeutic strategy is the ﬁrst to test whether blocking the early permeability - inducing effects of VEGF can preserve ischaemic tissue , ultimately leading to improved disease outcome and survival . VEGF expression in cancer . VEGF was originally discovered as a VPF , a protein secreted by tumour cells that potently stimulates ascites formation and vascular leak 1 . The phenomenon of vascular leak proximal to a tumour may promote extravasation of ﬁbrin and attract the cellular machinery and materials required to construct new blood vessels to feed the primary tumour . This vascular leak probably contributes to the elevated interstitial pressure common in solid tumours , which , along with the abnormal properties of tumour - associated vessels , can compromise drug delivery to the tumour 77 . In tumour - bearing animals 77 as well as rectal carcinoma patients 78 , blockade of VEGFR2 induces tumour - associated vessel ‘normalization’ , which improves outcome by decreasing the inter - stitial pressure and improving the function of the vascular network for delivery of cytotoxic therapies . Elevated levels of circulating VEGF provide a predictive measure of the progression of cancer and metastasis in certain cancers 79 , although inconsistencies exist with the collection and interpretation of circulating VEGF levels 80 . Dysregulated pathological angiogenesis and leaky blood vessels are common near tumours , and anti - VEGF treatment reduces tumour vascular permeability , vessel diameter , and can lead to tumour regression 81 . Recent clinical data suggest that although bevacizumab ( Avastin ) therapy alone has only modest effects on human tumours , it can signiﬁcantly increase survival of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer when combined with chemotherapy 82 . Emerging pre - clinical 77 , 83 and clinical 78 data indi - cate that the beneﬁt of combination therapy may be due to normal - ization of tumour vessels by anti - VEGF antibodies . This normalization effect includes a decrease in vascular permeability and concomitant decrease in interstitial pressure , resulting in increased drug delivery and oxygenation . In fact , VEGF blockade can also normalize pericyte and basement membrane coverage of tumour - associated blood vessels 83 . These apparent counter - intuitive ﬁndings and their cellular and molecular underpinnings are reviewed in a recent paper 84 . Tumour suppressor genes represent a natural defence against invasive tumour cells , which could be due , in part , to their regulation of VEGF production . For example , the tumour suppressor p53 downregulates VEGF , and its presence is sufﬁcient to prevent v - Src - induced increases in VEGF gene transcription 85 . Loss or mutation of the tumour suppressor gene von Hippel - Landau ( VHL ) is associated with increased VEGF and VEGF receptor expression and activity in some cancers 86 . Thus , strategies to target oncogenes and / or protect tumour suppressor genes may provide beneﬁt by limiting tumour - induced VEGF production . This would provide protection both by hindering tumour cell invasive properties as well as reducing the host angiogenic and permeability responses to the tumour cells . In fact , herceptin , which targets EGFR ( also known as Her2 or neu ) , has been shown to normalize and lower vascular permeability of tumour - associated vasculature 87 . We have recently shown that VEGF - expressing tumour cells in the circulation appear to extend protrusions towards endothelial cell junctions and disrupt cell – cell contact to enable their extravasation during the metastatic cascade 18 . Importantly , mice deﬁcient in Src or Yes show no vascular leak response to VEGF and consequently are resistant to tumour cell extravasation and metastasis 18 .

Consequences of vascular leak during disease . Breakdown of the vascular barrier probably has a critical role in cancer , as VEGF - induced platelet aggregates could certainly impede blood ﬂow in tumour - associated blood vessels . Alternatively , extensive high vas - cular pressure could couple vascular and interstitial compartments near a tumour , causing ﬂow stasis without complete vessel occlusion . Previous studies have examined the contribution of vascular leak , vessel compliance and interstitial ﬂuid pressure on pressure – ﬂow relationships in tumour vasculature 88 . These ﬁndings suggest that the microcirculation surrounding a tumour can be markedly affected by vascular compliance and leakiness , and that as these factors increase , blood is diverted away from the centre of a tumour towards its periphery . Thus , drug delivery to a tumour may be hindered by vascular leak , and therapeutic agents would probably accumulate in the periphery of a tumour without penetrating its core . The ability to modulate VEGF expression in a controlled micro - environment may provide a method to manipulate the vascular barrier . In some situations , increasing vascular permeability during drug delivery may allow for location - speciﬁc targeting of higher tolerated doses of compounds , which could be delivered via dermal patches or nasal spray . As discussed above , reducing tumour vessel leakiness might enhance tissue oxygenation and therapeutic drug delivery . In fact , the ability of VEGFR2 blockade to normalize tumour vasculature and improve drug delivery seems to involve decreased vascular leakiness along with increased pericyte coverage of tumour - associated blood vessels and a thickening of the vascular basement membrane 83 . In this case , VEGFR2 blockade may indirectly affect pericyte and extracellular matrix compartments via angiopoie - tin - 1 and MMP activation 83 . It should be emphasized that the host cells are critical in tumour - associated angiogenesis , as VEGF may be secreted from tumour and host cells to affect vascular hyperperme - ability in the local environment 89 . In addition to its beneﬁcial inﬂuence on ischaemic tissues , block - ing VEGF - induced vascular leak may be useful in the treatment of spinal cord injury 90 , pulmonary oedema due to acute lung injury or mechanical ventilation 91 , cerebral oedema associated with acute liver failure 92 , and retinal oedema associated with diabetes 93 . Oedema due to VEGF seems to be biochemically distinct from that induced by inﬂammation . This is based on the ﬁnding that Src - deﬁcient mice show no VEGF - mediated oedema , yet do show a normal oedema response to inﬂammatory mediators 6 . However , disruption of cell monolayer integrity or the vascular barrier in vivo can be attributed to a wide range of agents other than VEGF , including thrombin and histamine . It will be important to understand how the various permeability - inducing agents differ in their action , and what makes VEGF - induced permeability unique at the biochemical and molecular levels . In some circumstances , it may be preferable to block permeability induced by both VEGF and inﬂammatory pathways . To this end , recent studies suggest that blocking PI ( 3 ) K activity may interfere with both pathways of vascular leak and thereby provide signiﬁcant beneﬁt in models of myocardial infarction . Unexpected roles for VEGF . VEGF expression is linked to a growing collection of maladies and remedies . For example , nicotine is known to increase the risk of vascular disease , cancer and metastasis , and has recently been shown to cause a signiﬁcant increase in endothelial cell VEGF expression 94 . The carcinogenic effects of second - hand smoke are correlated with increased VEGF expression and plasma VEGF levels 95 . Some alternative remedies may provide their reputed beneﬁt by inadvertently inﬂuencing VEGF signalling pathways . For example , a compound derived from honeybee propolis reduces tumour cell expression of VEGF , thereby limiting tumour angiogenesis , invasion and metastasis 96 . Green tea catechins suppress VE - cadherin tyrosine phosphorylation and inhibit Akt activation during VEGF - induced angiogenesis 97 . Resveratrol , a phytoestrogen found in medicinal plants thought to provide some of the cardioprotective effects of red wine ( ‘the French paradox’ ) , reduces VEGF expression and angiogenesis in endothelial cells 98 and tumour cells 99 , and potently reduces tumour growth and metastasis in tumour - bearing mice 98 . In endothelial cells , resveratrol inhibits VEGF - induced angiogenesis by interrupting Src - dependent VE - cadherin and b - catenin tyrosine phosphorylation , retaining these adherens junction proteins at the cell – cell junctions and preserving endothelial barrier function 100 . Conclusions and future perspectives Clearly , VEGF - induced permeability did not evolve as a factor to exacerbate the deleterious effects of heart attacks or strokes , so what might its primary physiological function be ? VEGF - induced vascular leak at the site of infection could promote extravasation of proteins such as ﬁbrinogen , which polymerizes to form ﬁbrin in the extra - cellular space and provides an impenetrable barrier to contain an infection or the malignant growth of cells . Indeed , ﬁbrin is typically found surrounding tumours , areas of wound repair , or sites of infection 7 . However , during evolution , it would not have been possible to select against the negative aspects of VEGF - induced vascular leak during cancer or ischaemic injury , because these pathologies usually occur later in life after child - bearing years and are likely to be a function of a Western diet , environmental con - ditions and / or old age . Recent clinical efforts are underway to block VEGF - mediated leak pharmacologically in patients after acute myocardial infarction . Such efforts may have a signiﬁcant impact on reducing tissue injury and thereby minimizing the long - term consequences in this patient population . A similar therapeutic option may become available for stroke patients or individuals with retinal oedema . Blocking VEGF - mediated vascular leak may also have a profound effect in cancer patients by reducing the metastatic entry of tumour cells into or out of the vascular circulation . 1 . Senger , D .
