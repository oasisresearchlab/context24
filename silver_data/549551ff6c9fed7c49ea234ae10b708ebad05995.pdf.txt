ORIGINAL ARTICLE Ampli ﬁ ed Ras - MAPK signal states correlate with accelerated EGFR internalization , cytostasis and delayed HER2 tumor onset in Fer - de ﬁ cient model systems W Sangrar 1 , 2 , 3 , C Shi 1 , G Mullins 1 , 2 , D LeBrun 1 , 2 , B Ingalls 4 and PA Greer 1 , 2 The non - receptor tyrosine kinase Fer belongs to a distinct subfamily of F - BAR domain containing kinases implicated in vesicular traf ﬁ cking and signaling downstream of adhesion and growth factor receptors . Targeted inactivation of the fer gene in a transgenic mouse model of HER2 + , breast cancer was associated with delayed tumor onset and reduced proliferative rates in tumor cells . Fer de ﬁ ciency was associated with increased rates of epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) - induced epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) internalization and ampli ﬁ ed Ras - Raf - Mek - Erk ( Ras - MAPK ) signaling in primary mammary tumor epithelial cells , as well as increased cytotoxic and anti - proliferative sensitivity to the dual EGFR / HER2 inhibitor Lapatinib ( LPN ) . These observations suggest a model in which accelerated ligand - induced EGFR internalization in Fer - de ﬁ cient cells hypersensitizes the Ras - MAPK pathway to EGF , resulting in MAPK signal ampli ﬁ cation to levels that induce cytostasis , rather than proliferation . Thus , Ras - MAPK cytostatic signaling delays HER2 tumor initiation and increases LPN cytotoxicity in Fer - de ﬁ cient model systems . Taken together , these data suggest that targeting Fer alone , or in combination with LPN , may be of therapeutic bene ﬁ t in HER2 + breast cancer .

HER2 is overexpressed in about 30 % of primary mammary tumors and has been established as a relevant prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target in breast cancer . 2 , 3 EGFR and HER2 are coupled to the Ras - Raf - Mek - Erk ( Ras - MAPK ) pathway , which has a central role in the development and progression of cancer . 4 Activation of this pathway is detected in 30 % of all human cancers and its unregulated activity has been correlated with aberrant cell proliferation and survival . Inhibition of EGFR - Ras - MAPK signaling is a focal point of targeted anticancer strategies . Investigations of EGFR activation , traf ﬁ cking and signaling have contributed to a paradigmatic understanding of the mechanisms underlying oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinase signaling . Activated EGFR complexes recruit signal propagating SH2 - or PTB - domain containing adapter proteins , which are subsequently internalized by clathrin - dependent ( CD ) pathways . 1 These complexes continue to signal before they are inactivated in the endosome , recycled to the surface or targeted for lysosomal degradation . 5 EGFR internalized by CD routes is preferentially recycled , and this has been implicated in sustaining Ras - MAPK signaling . 6 A diverse range of extracellular ligands activate the ErbB receptor family by inducing multiple homo - and heterodimer pairings , allowing combinatorial generation of signal redundancy and diversity . 7 Stimulation of EGFR by EGF gives rise to EGFR homodimers , and EGFR - HER2 heterodimers . 8 , 9 HER2 itself has no known extracellular ligand and is thought to function as a non - autonomous signal ampli ﬁ er that potentiates mitogenic and survival signaling elicited by ligand activation of its heterodimeric partners . 7 Mutations in autophosphorylation sites in the cytoplas - mic domain of a HER2 / NEU oncoprotein encoded by an activated rodent neu transgene ( neu NT ) compromised its transforming potential and decreased tumor latency in mice . 10 These anti - tumor effects were correlated with Ras - dependent Erk and Akt activation in vivo , suggesting that signals from these pathways potentiate HER2 tumorigenesis . Fer , together with the paralogous Fps / Fes kinase , make up a distinct subclass of cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases . Fer is activated by both EGF and platelet - derived growth factor stimulation . 11 , 12 Fer directly interacts with both the EGFR and HER2 through its SH2 - domain . 13 Fer can also be activated by other cytokines , including erythropoietin and steel factor , and by integrin engagement . 14 – 16 These activities have been correlated with multifunctional cellular roles for Fer in adhesion , survival , proliferation and migration ; however , the molecular mechanisms by which Fer regulates these functions remain unknown . Fer harbors N - terminal sequences homologous to F - BAR domains . 17 , 18 F - BAR domains are implicated in membrane binding and bending events involved in receptor endocytosis and vesicular traf ﬁ cking . 19 , 20 This suggested a potential role for Fer in regulating EGFR signaling through effects on traf ﬁ cking . We present novel evidence that Fer inhibits the rate of EGFR internalization . In HER2 overexpression model systems , this inhibitory role for Fer effectively buffers Ras - MAPK signaling to optimal mitogenic levels 1 Division of Cancer Biology and Genetics , Queen ' s Cancer Research Institute , Kingston , Ontario , Canada ; 2 Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine , Queen ' s Cancer Research Institute , Queen ’ s University , Kingston , Ontario , Canada ; 3 Princess Margaret Cancer Centre , University Health Network , Toronto , Ontario , Canada and 4 Department of Applied Mathematics , University of Waterloo , Waterloo , Ontario , Canada .

RESULTS Accelerated EGFR internalization in Fer - de ﬁ cient mammary tumor epithelial cells correlates with enhanced Ras - MAPK signaling An F - BAR domain in Fer suggested a possible function for this kinase in regulating receptor internalization . EGF - induced EGFR internalization rates were therefore tested in primary mouse mammary tumor epithelial cells ( MTECs ) isolated from mouse mammary tumor virus - Neu ( neu NT ) transgenic mice with or without a targeted D743R fer mutation , that both abolishes kinase activity and destabilizes the protein ( fer DR / DR ) 12 ( Supplementary Figure S1A ) . EGFR internalization rates were elevated twofold in fer DR / DR MTECs relative to wild type ( fer + / + ) counterparts ( Figure 1a ) . Furthermore , the rate of EGF - induced receptor internalization was reduced by twofold in the human HER2 overexpressing breast cancer cell line SKBR3 upon ectopic expression of Fer ( Figure 1b , Supplementary Figure S1B ) . These data suggest that Fer negatively regulates the rate of EGFR internalization and raises the possibility that Fer regulates the ef ﬁ ciency of CD endocytosis . As the rate of CD endocytosis has been implicated in promoting downstream Ras - MAPK signaling , we next compared short - term EGF - induced effects on Ras - MAPK signaling in neu NT | fer + / + and neu NT | fer DR / DR MTECs . Erk activity or signal strength , as assessed by a phospho - speci ﬁ c antibody that recognizes the active state of Erk ( pErk ) , was used as a surrogate of Ras - MAPK signal output through this pathway . Remarkably , EGF - induced Mek and Erk signal strengths were enhanced in fer DR / DR MTECs relative to wild - type MTECs ( Figures 1c and d , respectively ; Supplementary Figure S2A ) . Conversely , EGF - induced Erk signaling was suppressed in SKBR3 cells ectopically expressing Fer ( Figure 1e ; Supplementary Figure S2B ) . We were also interested in how expression of a stable kinase - dead Fer protein ( mimicking effective pharmacologic inhibition ) would effect EGF - induced EGFR internalization and Ras - MAPK signaling . fer DR / DR MTEC variants expressing Myc epitope tagged wild type or kinase - dead Fer ( K592R mutation of the conserved ATP binding site ; 21 Supplementary Figure S1D ) displayed reduced or enhanced EGFR internalization ( Supplementary Figure S1E ) ; and this correlated with reduced or enhanced EGF - induced Erk activation , respec - tively ( Supplementary Figure S1F ) . These observations suggested that stronger EGF - induced signaling responses in the Fer - de ﬁ cient MTECs are associated with enhanced EGFR internalization through CD pathways . Enhanced steady - state Ras - MAPK activity in neu NT | fer DR / DR tumors correlates with reduced proliferative potential and delayed tumor onset Steady - state Ras - MAPK signaling in vivo may be driven by stable EGF input , which could be further potentiated by elevated HER2 expression in tumors . 7 , 22 , 23 This led us to hypothesize that the transiently observed increases in EGF - induced Ras - MAPK signal strength in fer DR / DR MTECs might re ﬂ ect enhanced steady - state 0 . 0 2 . 5 5 . 0 7 . 5 10 . 0 12 . 5 0 . 0 0 . 5 1 . 0 1 . 5 2 . 0 fer + / + fer DR / DR Time ( min ) I n t e r na li z ed / S u r f a c e ( A .

Immunohistochemical ( IHC ) analyses showed that active Erk staining was increased in murine neu NT - driven tumors relative to normal mammary glands ( Supplementary Figure S3A ) ; furthermore , active Erk staining was also apparent in human HER2 + breast tumor tissue ( Supplementary Figure S3A ) . Semiquantitative estimation of active Erk staining intensity in neu NT | fer + / + and neu NT | fer DR / DR tumor sections suggested that Ras - MAPK signals were more pronounced in Fer - de ﬁ cient tumors ( Figure 2a ) . This was apparent as early as 3 days post tumor detection , and became up to threefold higher by day 28 ( Figure 2a ) . Immunoblotting analyses of resected tumors con ﬁ rmed these observations , showing threefold increases in steady - state Erk activity in neu NT | fer DR / DR tumors ( Figure 2b ) . Increases in Ras - MAPK signaling have been classically associated with increased prolifera - tion . Unexpectedly , blind clinico - pathological evaluation suggested that mitotic and tumor progression indices were reduced in neu NT | fer DR / DR tumors compared with neu NT | fer + / + tumors ( Supplementary Figure S3B ) . Quanti ﬁ cation of nuclear proliferating antigen ( Ki67 ) staining intensity con ﬁ rmed reductions in fer DR / DR tumor prolifera - tion indices for up to 14 days post tumor - onset ( Figure 2c ; Supplementary Figure S3B ) . Additional experiments e x vivo , showed that fer DR / DR MTECs exhibited reduced proliferative capacity ( Figure 2d ) and reduced sensitivity to EGF - induced mitogenesis relative to fer + / + MTECs ( Figure 2f ) ; and this was associated with increased ( EGF - dependent ) steady - state Ras - MAPK activity ( Figure 2e ) .

Taken together , these data suggest a cell autonomous role for Fer in the development of neu NT tumors that is associated with enhanced EGF - dependent proliferation and sup - pressed EGF - induced Ras - MAPK signaling . Fer de ﬁ ciency is associated with hypersensitive cytotoxic responses to Lapatinib and enhanced Ras - MAPK responses to EGF To gain insight into the link between accelerated EGFR internalization and the anti - tumorigenic effect of Fer de ﬁ ciency , we compared the relative dependence of fer + / + and fer DR / DR MTECs on EGFR survival signaling . Pharmacological perturbation with the dual EGFR and HER2 inhibitor Lapatinib ( LPN ) , showed that fer DR / DR MTECs are an order - of - magnitude more sensitive to the cytotoxic effects of LPN than fer + / + MTECs ( Figure 3a ) . This difference could be rescued by ectopic expression of Fer in fer DR / DR MTECs ( Figure 3a , Supplementary Figure S1C ) . We next assessed the effect of LPN on Erk inhibition , which lies down - stream of EGFR and HER2 signaling . The EC 50 for cell death induction and Erk inhibition by LPN were nearly an order - of - magnitude apart in fer + / + or Fer - rescued fer DR / DR MTECs , but were nearly identical in fer DR / DR MTECs ( Figures 3b – d ) . This suggests a close link between neutralization of Ras - MAPK survival signaling and LPN - induced cytotoxicity in Fer - de ﬁ cient MTECs . The nature of this link was further explored by assessing the effect of LPN on EGF - induced Erk activity across a wide range of stimulatory and inhibitory concentrations . Ras - MAPK signal strength induced by a range of EGF inputs was greater in fer DR / DR MTECs relative to fer + / + MTECs ( Figure 4a with b ; compare arrows ) ; and this difference was reversed in Fer - rescued fer DR / DR MTECs ( Figure 4c ) . Increases in EGF - induced Ras - MAPK signal strength in fer DR / DR MTECs relative to fer + / + MTECs ( Figure 4d ) were linked to an increase in Ras - MAPK sensitivity to EGF in fer DR / DR MTECs ( Figure 4e ) . Further inspection of EGF - LPN - response pro ﬁ les in fer + / + MTECs showed that LPN - mediated Ras - MAPK signal inhibition is characterized by gently graded responses across all EGF concentrations ( Figure 4a ) . In contrast , Ras - MAPK signal inhibition by LPN in fer DR / DR MTECs is characterized by steeply graded , all - or - none - like responses at higher EGF concentration ranges ( Figure 4b ) . Quanti ﬁ cation of the pharmacological responsiveness ( n ) , which de ﬁ nes the steepness of MAPK signal decline in individual drug - response curves , showed that fer DR / DR MTECs are hyper responsive to LPN - mediated Erk inhibition at EGF concentrations exceeding 5 ng / ml ( Figure 4f ) . The enhanced potency and strength of Ras - MAPK signal induction in fer DR / DR MTECs demonstrates that these cells are hypersensitized to EGF input . Interestingly , this increase in sensitivity is associated with increased LPN responsiveness at elevated EGF concentrations . Enhanced LPN - mediated cytotoxicity in fer DR / DR MTECs is associated with compromised mitogenic responses and poor Ras - MAPK signal - inhibition durability We further investigated the association between LPN - induced cytotoxicity and Ras - MAPK signaling by sampling pErk activity and cell density over a 72 h course of LPN treatment . Growing fer + / + and fer DR / DR MTECs were dosed at 24 h intervals with fresh media containing EGF and varying concentrations of LPN ( Figure 5 ; arrows 1 – 3 ; Supplementary Figure S4 ) . This dosing approach was used to minimize effects associated with drug depletion . 24 fer DR / DR MTEC cell densities declined immediately after the ﬁ rst media change ( arrow 1 ) , but this does not appear to be due to LPN , because it is also apparent in the absence of drug ( Figure 5b ; Supplementary Figure S4 ) . Thereafter , cell densities stabilized until 8 h , after which they displayed a LPN dose - dependent decline until 24 h . In contrast , fer + / + MTECs were more resilient to the media change and drug challenge , displaying little if any loss of cell density for the ﬁ rst 8 h ( Figure 5a ; Supplementary Figure S4 ) . Cell density decreased in a drug dose - dependent manner from 8 to 24 h , but not to the same extent as seen in fer DR / DR MTECs . Media change at 24 h ( arrow 2 ) correlated with an increase in cell density for both fer + / + and fer DR / DR cells , even in the presence of LPN .

These observations suggest the presence of subpopula - tions of surviving MTECs that are mitogenically responsive to EGF , even in the face of potent cytotoxic insult . Media replacement at 48 h produced a third minor proliferative burst , which was more resistant to LPN in fer + / + MTECs ( arrow 3 ) . These observations were reproducible at higher cell densities , suggesting that the weaker mitogenic responses in fer DR / DR MTECs are independent of contact inhibition effects ( Supplementary Figure S5 ) . Concomitant Ras - MAPK signal monitoring showed that LPN transiently inhibited Ras - MAPK signaling in both lines at the ﬁ rst and second LPN challenges ( Figures 5c and d ; arrows 1 and 2 ) ; but interestingly , signal recovery was more apparent in the fer DR / DR cells . Indeed , after the 48 h media change , Ras - MAPK signaling in fer DR / DR cells appeared resistant to LPN challenge ( Figures 5c and d ; arrow 3 ) . These data suggested that signal - inhibition durability is compro - mised in fer DR / DR MTECs and that signal strengths recover quickly , often to levels exceeding pre - treatment . Similar phenomenon were observed in the context of inhibition of Akt ( Supplementary Figures S4 and S6 ) . Taken together , these data suggested that enhanced cytotoxic sensitivity to LPN in fer DR / DR MTECs is associated with reduced capacity of these cells to compensate mitogenically for drug - induced cell death , and with decreased durability of Ras - MAPK and PI3K - Akt signal inhibition by LPN . DISCUSSION Fer - dependent deceleration of EGFR internalization correlates with suppressed MAPK signaling We show here that Fer de ﬁ ciency is associated with enhanced EGF - induced EGFR internalization and increased Ras - MAPK signaling ( Figure 1 ) . Interestingly , while this phenotype is reversed by ectopic expression of wild - type Fer , we observed an enhance - ment of these effects when a kinase - dead variant of Fer is overexpressed ( Supplementary Figures S1D – F ) . This suggests that pharmacologic inhibition of Fer may achieve the same effect in vivo . Current views suggest that MAPK signaling is sustained by internalization of EGFR complexes . Studies have shown that Ras - MAPK signaling is speci ﬁ cally suppressed by perturbations that disrupt CD endocytosis , including clathrin / AP - 2 knockdown , dominant - negative dynamin mutants and monodansylcadaverine treatment . 6 , 25 , 26 This view however , has been recently contested by a report in which disruption of CD endocytosis by conditional dynamin depletion failed to correlate with reduced MAPK stimulation . 27 Although our data support the view that Ras - MAPK signaling is potentiated by EGFR internalization , we have not directly shown that the reduced EGFR internalization rates in Fer - de ﬁ cient systems involves CD routes . Recent progress has shown that in addition to CD internalization , receptors can also be endocytosed through clathrin - independent routes , which prefer - entially direct EGFR to degradation through canonical endosomal routes . 28 , 29 The EGF concentrations used in our study can elicit both CD and clathrin - independent internalization pathways ; 6 thus , the suppression of EGFR routing by Fer through either CD or clathrin - independent pathways may be linked with regulation of MAPK signaling . Mechanisms underlying inhibition of the rate of EGFR internalization by Fer It remains unclear where along the endocytic process Fer affects EGFR internalization ; however , previous studies suggest that several hypothetical mechanisms are plausible . Fer and its paralogue Fes co - localize with peripheral microtubules and phosphorylate tubulin at sites of microtubule formation . 30 , 31 Co - localization was dependent upon F - BAR domains and kinase activity , suggesting that Fer may suppress transport of surface signaling complexes through regulation of microtubule - dependent vesicle transport . Other studies suggest that Fer could in ﬂ uence actin dynamics underlying receptor traf ﬁ cking by phosphorylation of the actin - modeling protein cortactin ; 15 1 10 100 1 2 3 4 fer + / + fer DR / DR Rescue [ EGF ] ng / ml p E r k r e s pon s i v ne ss t o Lapa t i n i b i nh i b i t i on ( n ) Rescue * 2 4 6 * * * 0 10 20 30 40 50 * * * * * p E r k ( A .

Phosphatidic acid was shown to bind a putative FX domain of Fer and potentiate its kinase activity . 37 Localized EGF - induced phospholipase D activation at vesicle necks accelerates EGFR endocytosis and transiently elevates levels of the phospholipase D product phosphatidic acid . 23 As phosphatidic acid generation at this locale is rate limiting for endocytosis , phosphatidic acid - dependent activation of Fer may have a regulatory role in this endocytic rate - limiting process . In summary , although the mechanism by which Fer regulates EGFR internalization and downstream signaling remains unclear , there are several potential avenues for future studies to explore this question . Inhibition of EGFR internalization by Fer is associated with suppressed EGF - induced Ras - MAPK signaling , enhanced proliferation and accelerated tumor onset Our data show that augmented Ras - MAPK signal strength and sensitivity to EGF correlates with impaired EGF - dependent proliferation in fer DR / DR systems . Although counter - intuitive from the general view that MAPK signaling is inherently mitogenic , these results are less paradoxical than they would seem . Numerous early reports showed that EGF and EGFR exhibit biphasic effects on proliferation as threshold - exceeding receptor activity or ligand levels are growth inhibitory . 38 – 40 More recent reports continue to support this biphasic behavior showing that excessive growth factor - induced Ras - MAPK signaling can induce hypermitogenic ( non - G 0 ) arrest , primarily through induction of cyclin - dependent - kinase inhibitors . 41 Our data suggest that such biphasic responses could re ﬂ ect alterations in sensitivity to EGF imparted by the internalization signaling circuitry . This in turn , could modulate quantitative features of downstream Ras - MAPK signaling implicated in cell response speci ﬁ city ( that is , prolifera - tion , quiescence or differentiation ) . 42 , 43 Thus , EGF input buffering by the internalization machinery could have a role in setting the upper and lower bounds of Ras - MAPK signal strengths appro - priate for normal cell proliferation . However , in malignancy , EGFR may be exposed to high levels of EGF , making the system prone to stimulation beyond upper proliferative - response thresholds ; 44 and this could be exacerbated by neu NT / HER2 overexpression . Fer may buffer the response of the system to EGF and promote HER2 tumorigenesis by reducing otherwise cytostatic Ras - MAPK signal strengths to levels conducive for proliferation ( Supplementary Figure S7B ) . We propose that such a mechanism may underlie the pro - tumorigenic effect of Fer observed in neu NT mice ( Figure 6 ; Supplementary Figure S7B ) . Indeed , meta - analysis of transcrip - tome data predicts that elevated Fer expression is associated with decreased survival in HER2 breast cancer 45 ( Supplementary Figure S8 ) .

Fer promotes HER2 tumorigenesis W Sangrar et al 4114 Oncogene ( 2015 ) 4109 – 4117 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited conferring a pro - proliferation ﬁ tness bene ﬁ t under conditions of elevated ( cytostatic ) EGFR - HER2 - Ras - MAPK signaling . Recently , it was shown that cytostatic Ras - MAPK signal strengths conferred an anti - proliferative ﬁ tness de ﬁ cit to vemurafenib - resistant BRafV600E melanomas , which could be turned into a pro - proliferative ﬁ tness bene ﬁ t through vemurafenib - mediated reduc - tion of Ras - MAPK to optimal proliferation ranges . 46 This highlights the importance of Ras - MAPK signal quantity in proliferative responses , and supports a model in which Fer inhibitors could induce cytostatic Ras - MAPK signal strengths through promoting receptor internalization ( Supplementary Figure S7B ) . Fer inhibition could promote the cytotoxic effects of LPN Increased sensitivity to LPN - induced cytotoxicity in fer DR / DR MTECs closely correlated with Ras - MAPK signal neutralization ( Figure 3 ) ; and increases in cell density in response to periodic challenges with EGF and LPN were more pronounced in fer + / + MTECs than in fer DR / DR MTECs ( Figures 5a and b ) . These data suggest that EGF induces proliferative bursts in fer + / + MTECs with greater ef ﬁ ciency than in fer DR / DR MTECs ; further supporting a role for Fer in ﬁ ne - tuning the proliferative response . This is consistent with observations of hypo - proliferative steady - state tumor cell indices ( Figures 2c and d ) , enhanced Ras - MAPK signal strength and sensitivity to EGF ( Figures 4d and e ; Supplementary Figure S7A ) , and reduced mitogenicity in Fer - de ﬁ cient systems ( Figure 2f ) . Thus , enhanced LPN cytotoxicity in fer DR / DR MTECs may be caused by inef ﬁ cient proliferative compensation for cell death as a result of ampli ﬁ ed Ras - MAPK signaling states . We propose that Fer inhibition could antagonize this resistance mechanism by inducing cytostatic effects in these populations through hyper - induction of Ras - MAPK signaling . MATERIALS AND METHODS Reagents Antibodies against phospho ( p ) S217 / pS221 Mek1 / 2 ( pMek ) , pT202 / pY204 Erk1 / 2 ( pErk ) , Mek and Erk were obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies ( Danvers , MA , USA ) . Tubulin and Ki67 ( clone K - 2 ) antibodies were purchased from Sigma - Aldrich ( Oakville , ON , Canada ) and Ventana ( Tuscon , AZ , USA ) , respectively . Biotin - EGF and EGF were obtained from Invitrogen ( Carlsbad , CA , USA ) and R & D systems ( Minneapolis , MN , USA ) , respectively . LPN was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals ( North York , ON , Canada ) . Fluorescein isothiocyanate - Mouse anti - Bromodeoxyuridine ( Brdu ) staining kit was obtained from Bd Pharmingen ( San Diego , Ca , Usa ) . Mice Mice targeted with a knock - in kinase - inactivating mutation at the fer locus ( fer DR / DR mice ) were previously reported . 12 Brie ﬂ y , the targeted germline missense mutation in fer results in a D743R substitution that both eliminates Fer kinase activity and destabilizes the protein , resulting in a null - like phenotype in fer DR / DR mice . neu NT transgenic mice ( strain TG . NK ) , expressing the activated rat neu oncogenic Her2 allele in mammary epithelial cells under the control of the mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat , were obtained from Jackson Labs . neu NT female mice develop mammary tumors with 100 % penetrance . 47 Female progeny hemizygous for the neu NT transgene were derived from fer + / DR x neu NT ; fer + / DR crosses and palpated to detect nascent tumors twice a week . 48 Mice were housed at the Animal Care Facility at Queen ’ s University . Cell lines MTECs were isolated from tumor bearing neu NT | fer DR / DR and neu NT | fer + / + mice as described , 49 and cultured in improved minimum essential medium supplemented with 2 % fetal bovine serum , 15 ng / ml of EGF , 10 μ g / ml insulin , 1 μ g / ml hydrocortisone and 20 n M estrogen ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . SKBR3 cells were obtained from ATCC ( Manassas , VA , USA ) and cultured in Dulbecco ’ s modi ﬁ ed Eagle ’ s medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum . EGFR internalization The rate of EGF - induced EGFR internalization was estimated using biotin - EGF as a surrogate marker of receptor internalization kinetics in fer + / + and fer DR / DR MTECs . The procedure has been described previously and was adopted for biotin - EGF - based microtitre assays . 50 – 52 Brie ﬂ y , cells were serum starved for 12 – 16 h and pulsed with 100 ng / ml biotin - EGF for 0 – 10 min at 37 °C in serum - free medium in the presence or absence of 100 - fold molar excess unlabeled EGF . EGFR internalization was assessed by tracking surface and internalized levels of biotin - EGF over time using immunocytochemistry . 53 Surface biotin - EGF levels were assessed in a parallel set of experiments by ﬁ xing cells in 3 % paraformaldehyde , 0 . 25 % glutaraldehyde for 30 min at 37 °C . Internalized biotin - EGF was assessed by acid - stripping receptor - bound EGF followed by membrane permeabiliza - tion and ﬁ xation . Surface and internalized biotin - EGF were measured chromogenically at 450 nm with a streptavidin - peroxidase conjugate in a Spectramax M5e spectrophotometer ( Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA , USA ) . EGFR internalization rates were estimated from the slope of a straight line ﬁ tted to data representing changes in the ratios of internalized to surface EGF over time . 52 At high biotin - EGF concentrations ( 20 – 100 ng / ml ) approximately 60 % of EGFR is internalized by CD and 40 % by clathrin - independent . 6 Ras - MAPK signaling Ras - MAPK signal activation pro ﬁ les were assessed by serum starving cells for 12 – 16 h prior to stimulation with 50 ng / ml EGF for 0 – 60 min . Cells were lysed in radio - immunoprecipitation assay buffer and Mek and Erk activity were assayed by immunoblotting or pErk was assayed using in - cell immunocytochemistry .

Fer - dependent inhibition of EGFR internalization promotes HER2 tumorigenesis by minimizing rate - limiting cytostasis induced by ampli ﬁ ed Ras - MAPK signaling . We propose that internalization serves to maintain physiologically appropriate dynamical and quantitative relationships between input stimulus and Ras - MAPK signal output . Internalization rates speci ﬁ cally in ﬂ uence the cou - pling strength between ligand input and signal output . Fer - mediated inhibition of internalization decreases this coupling strength by buffering Ras - MAPK responses to EGF input . Input buffering could protect against overstimulation and down modulate Ras - MAPK signal strength to levels optimal for eliciting appropriate proliferation during physiological homeostasis . This same buffering effect may promote tumor development by tempering EGF / HER2 - driven increases in Ras - MAPK signaling that would otherwise be cytostatic . Fer promotes HER2 tumorigenesis W Sangrar et al 4115 © 2015 Macmillan Publishers Limited Oncogene ( 2015 ) 4109 – 4117 cells were pretreated with varying concentrations of LPN ( 0 – 20 μ M ) for 30 min prior to treatment with varying concentrations of EGF ( 0 – 100 ng / ml ) for 5 min . Erk activity was assessed by in cell immuno - cytochemistry using anti - pErk antibodies as a surrogate measure for Ras - MAPK signal output . For long - term drug - signal interaction experiments , MTECs were cultured under standard conditions in 96 - well plates , and treated with constant EGF ( 50 ng / ml ) and varying LPN ( 0 – 100 μ M ) every 24 h . Cell density , Erk and Akt activity were assessed at the indicated times by crystal violet staining and in cell immunocytochemistry , respectively . Immunohistochemical and biochemical analysis Tumors were resected at 3 , 14 or 28 days post onset from fer + / + and fer DR / DR mice and embedded in paraf ﬁ n for IHC ( 3 , 14 and 28 days ) or frozen in liquid nitrogen for biochemical studies ( 14 days ) . Freshly sectioned paraf ﬁ n - embedded samples were immunostained for Ki67 antigen or active Erk using the Ventana Discovery XT automated system . Ki67 and pErk staining intensities were estimated using the Aperio Image Analysis Software ( Vista , CA , USA ) . Tumor and tissues were homogenized in radio - immunoprecipitation assay buffer and assayed by western blotting with pErk and Erk antibodies . B and intensities were quanti ﬁ ed using ImageJ software ( NIH , Bethesda , MD , USA ) . Proliferation and cytotoxicity assays For proliferation experiments , fer + / + and fer DR / DR MTECs were plated at low density in 6 - well ( 150 000 – 225 000 cells per well ) or 96 - well plates ( 5000 – 7500 cells per well ) and allowed to grow for 24 – 48 h . For EGF - induced DNA - synthesis experiments , serum - starved cells were pretreated with BrdU and stimulated with increasing concentrations of EGF for 24 h . Fluorescent intensity was detected with an anti - Fluorescein isothiocyanate - BrdU antibody . For cytotoxicity assays , fer + / + and fer DR / DR MTECs cell were plated at high density in 96 - well plates ( 20 000 – 25 000 cells per well ) in the presence of varying concentrations of LPN for 72 h . Cell viability was assessed by tetrazolium salt reduction ( Cell Counting Kit - 8 ; Dojindo Technologies , MD , USA ) . Statistics EC 50 and drug responsiveness ( n ) were estimated by non - linear regression analyses to four parameter sigmoidal functions . Total Ras - MAPK signal strength was estimated as the total area under dose - response curves . Analysis of variances and t - tests were determined using EXCEL ( Microsoft Inc . , Seattle , WA , USA ) and PRISM ( GraphPad Software , La Jolla , CA , USA ) .
