Our previous study indicated that mechanical stretch altered the proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts , associated with insulin growth factor 1 ( IGF - 1 ) - mediated phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) / Akt ( also known as protein kinase B ) and mitogen - activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) pathways through IGF - 1 receptor ( IGF - 1R ) . The purpose of this study was to explore the same stretches on the proliferation of L6 myoblasts and its association with IGF - 1 - regulated PI3K / Akt and MAPK activations . L6 myoblasts were divided into three groups : control , 15 % stretch , and 20 % stretch . Stretches were achieved using FlexCell Strain Unit . Cell proliferation and IGF - 1 concentration were detected by CCK8 and ELISA , respectively . IGF - 1R expression , and expressions and activities of PI3K , Akt , and MAPKs ( including extracellular signal - regulated kinases 1 and 2 ( ERK1 / 2 ) and p38 ) were determined by Western blot . We found that 15 % stretch promoted , while 20 % stretch inhibited L6 myoblast proliferation . A 15 % stretch increased IGF - 1R level , although had no effect on IGF - 1 secretion of L6 myoblasts , and PI3K / Akt and ERK1 / 2 ( not p38 ) inhibitors attenuated 15 % stretch - induced pro - proliferation . Exogenous IGF - 1 reversed 20 % stretch - induced anti - proliferation , accompanied with increases in IGF - 1R level as well as PI3K / Akt and MAPK ( ERK1 / 2 and p38 ) activations . In conclusion , stretch regulated L6 myoblasts proliferation , which may be mediated by the changes in PI3K / Akt and MAPK activations regulated by IGF - 1R , despite no detectable IGF - 1 from stretched L6 myoblasts .

Introduction Appropriate exercise increases [ 1 – 3 ] , while excessive exercise or overtraining decreases the skeletal muscle mass and strength in animals and human [ 4 , 5 ] . Appropriate exercise leads to satellite cell activation and transformation to myoblasts , and promotes proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts , as well as fusion into multinucleated myotubes in vivo , thus inducing skeletal muscle hypertrophy [ 6 , 7 ] . However , the underlying mechanisms of appropriate exercise - induced muscle hypertrophy have not been fully elucidated , let alone the mechanisms of excessive exercise on the decrease of muscle mass . Mechanical stretches on skeletal muscles play an important role in exercise - regulated skeletal muscle hypertrophy and injury / remodeling , so exogenous mechanical stretch was used to mimic exercise stimulation in vitro . For the crucial effects of skeletal muscle satellite cells and myoblasts on Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2018 , 19 , 1649 ; doi : 10 . 3390 / ijms19061649 www . mdpi . com / journal / ijms Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2018 , 19 , 1649 2 of 12 muscle hypertrophy , repair and regeneration [ 8 ] , these cells , such as primary satellite cells and mouse C2C12 myoblasts receiving different mechanical stretches are good models to clarify the molecular mechanisms of myogenesis responses to exercise in vitro . Mounting evidence , including our previous work , demonstrated that appropriate cyclic mechanical stretches with multiple deformations ( 10 % , 15 % , and 17 % ) , frequency ( 0 . 25 , 0 . 5 , and 1 Hz ) , and durations ( 1 h , 2 h ) promoted the proliferation of primary satellite cells and C2C12 myoblasts [ 9 , 10 ] , and inhibited their differentiation into myotubes . However , few studies reported the inﬂuence of overstretch on cell proliferation and differentiation , and despite its important signiﬁcance in regulating excessive exercise - induced muscular adaptation , the limited literature has reported that when the magnitude of cyclic mechanical stretch increased up to 20 % , the proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts [ 9 ] and rat aortic smooth muscle cells [ 11 ] were inhibited , and even induced apoptosis in myoblasts [ 12 ] . However , studies about stretching on another myoblast cell line - rat L6 myoblasts are rare , and the effects of mechanical stretch on the proliferation and differentiation of L6 myoblasts remain unknown . Phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) / Akt activation fulﬁls crucial roles in regulating cell proliferation and protein synthesis . Mechanical stretch - induced vascular remodeling process was through PI3K / Akt activation [ 13 ] . In C2C12 myoblasts , the pro - proliferation of 15 % mechanical stretch was also through PI3K / Akt activation [ 9 ] , furthermore , PI3K inhibitor LY294002 inhibited the proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts [ 9 ] and adult bovine myoblasts [ 14 ] . Three subsets of mitogen - activated protein kinases ( MAPKs ) , extracellular signal - regulated kinases 1 and 2 ( ERK1 / 2 ) , p38 MAPK ( p38 ) , and c - Jun N - terminal kinase ( JNK ) , are vital pathways that transfer extracellular signals into cells , and are closely associated with the proliferation and differentiation of cells [ 15 , 16 ] . Growing evidence points to the important role of MAPKs in mechanical stretch regulated proliferation , differentiation , and protein synthesis of skeletal muscle cells . For example , 10 % of cyclic mechanical stretch stimulated the proliferation and inhibited the differentiation of bovine satellite cells via activation of ERK1 / 2 and of C2C12 myoblasts via activations of p38 and ERK1 / 2 [ 9 ] ; cyclic stretch promoted the protein synthesis of C2C12 by increasing the activities of p38 and ERK1 / 2 , and JNK responsive to 30 min of 5 % or 15 % stretch [ 17 ] , and by activating ERK1 / 2 and p38 responsive to 24 h of 5 % stretch [ 18 ] . It is well established that the most common upstream signal molecule of PI3K / Akt is insulin - like growth factor ( IGF - 1 ) , which plays an important role in both the proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts . Exogenous IGF - 1 not only induced myoblast proliferation in vitro in a dose - dependent manner , but also increased satellite cell number in the skeletal muscle of embryonic chickens [ 19 ] . The primary effects of IGF - 1 , including activating PI3K / Akt pathway , are mediated by binding to the IGF - 1 receptor ( IGF - 1R ) , a widely expressed cell surface heterotetramer . Mechanical stretch enhanced the proliferation of venous smooth muscle cells [ 20 ] , and primary cardiac ﬁbroblasts via activation of IGF - 1R / PI3K / Akt pathway . As for the association of MAPK with IGF - 1 and IGF - 1R , it has been reported that IGF - 1 and IGF - 1R affected cell proliferation and differentiation via ERK1 / 2 and p38 in human dental pulp stem cells [ 21 ] and via ERK1 / 2 in perivascular adipocyte [ 22 ] . Our previous work indicated that the pro - proliferation of 15 % stretch and anti - proliferation of 20 % stretch on C2C12 myoblasts were mediated by upregulating and downregulating IGF - 1 - induced activations of PI3K / Akt and MAPKs ( p38 and ERK1 / 2 ) , respectively . Therefore , the purpose of the present study is to clarify whether 15 % and 20 % cyclic mechanical stretches modulate the proliferation of rat L6 myoblasts , and whether the effects of stretches are related to the expressions and activities of PI3K / Akt and MAPKs ( p38 and ERK1 / 2 ) regulated by IGF - 1 / IGF - 1R .

Effects of Cyclic Mechanical Stretch on the Proliferation of L6 Myoblasts Effects of 15 % and 20 % cyclic mechanical stretches on the proliferation of rat L6 myoblasts were detected , and we found that the proliferation of L6 myoblasts was significantly increased by 15 % stretch for 6 h , while decreased by 20 % stretch for 6 h compared with relative control ( CON ) , respectively ( Figure 1 ) . Figure 1 . Effects of cyclic mechanical stretch on the proliferation of L6 myoblasts . L6 myoblasts were seeded onto flexible - bottomed 6 - well plates coated with type I collagen at 1 × 10 5 / mL and incubated for 24 h , then the cells were subjected to 15 % or 20 % cyclic mechanical stretch at 0 . 5 Hz for 6 h . At 24 h after stretch finished , the proliferation of L6 myoblasts was detected by CCK8 .

Effects of Cyclic Mechanical Stretch on the Expressions and Activities of PI3K / Akt and MAPKs ( p38 and ERK1 / 2 ) in L6 Myoblasts Both 15 % and 20 % stretch did not change the protein levels of PI3K ( PI3K / glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) ) and Akt ( Akt / GAPDH ) in L6 myoblasts compared with unstretched control ( CON ) . However , the activities of PI3K ( ratio of p - PI3K / PI3K ) and Akt ( ratio of p - Akt / Akt ) were significantly increased in 15 % stretched L6 myoblasts , while significantly decreased by 20 % stretch ( Figure 2A ) . As shown in Figure 2B , neither 15 % nor 20 % stretch had an effect on the protein levels of p38 and ERK1 / 2 compared with CON , but ERK1 / 2 activity ( ratio of p - ERK1 / 2 / ERK1 / 2 ) was significantly increased in 15 % stretched L6 myoblasts , while it was decreased in 20 % stretched cells . For p38 activity ( ratio of p - p38 / p38 ) , it was unaltered by 15 % stretch , but significantly declined by 20 % stretch . Figure 1 .

Effects of Cyclic Mechanical Stretch on the Expressions and Activities of PI3K / Akt and MAPKs ( p38 and ERK1 / 2 ) in L6 Myoblasts Both 15 % and 20 % stretch did not change the protein levels of PI3K ( PI3K / glyceraldehyde - 3 - phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH ) ) and Akt ( Akt / GAPDH ) in L6 myoblasts compared with unstretched control ( CON ) . However , the activities of PI3K ( ratio of p - PI3K / PI3K ) and Akt ( ratio of p - Akt / Akt ) were signiﬁcantly increased in 15 % stretched L6 myoblasts , while signiﬁcantly decreased by 20 % stretch ( Figure 2A ) . As shown in Figure 2B , neither 15 % nor 20 % stretch had an effect on the protein levels of p38 and ERK1 / 2 compared with CON , but ERK1 / 2 activity ( ratio of p - ERK1 / 2 / ERK1 / 2 ) was signiﬁcantly increased in 15 % stretched L6 myoblasts , while it was decreased in 20 % stretched cells . For p38 activity ( ratio of p - p38 / p38 ) , it was unaltered by 15 % stretch , but signiﬁcantly declined by 20 % stretch . Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2018 , 19 , 1649 4 of 12 Int . J . Mol .

Discussion Cellular responses to mechanical stimulus vary not only with parameters of applied mechanical stretch , such as magnitude , frequency , and duration , but also depending on the type of cells being stretched , so on the basis of pro - proliferation of 15 % mechanical stretch ( 6 h at 0 . 5 Hz ) and anti - proliferation of 20 % stretches ( 6 h at 0 . 5 Hz ) on mouse C2C12 myoblasts from our previous study [ 9 ] , one purpose of the present study was to detect the influence of similar stretches on rat L6 myoblasts . We found that 15 % and 20 % mechanical stretches lasting for 6 h at 0 . 5 Hz promoted and inhibited the proliferation of rat L6 myoblasts respectively , similar to C2C12 myoblasts , which suggested the universality of stretch - induced proliferation changes in myoblasts . To our knowledge , this is the first report about the effects of mechanical stretch on the proliferation of L6 myoblasts . PI3K / Akt and MAPKs ( p38 and ERK1 / 2 ) exert considerable roles on exercise - regulated skeletal muscle mass by regulating cell cycle progression . It has been reported that PI3K / Akt , a master cascade signal in satellite cells or myoblasts , regulated G1 / S cell cycle progression by altering the levels and activities of cell cycle regulators [ 14 , 19 ] . Similarly , ERK1 / 2 activation by low frequency pulsed electromagnetic field was also shown to be crucial for the transition from G1 to S phase in C2C12 myoblasts [ 23 ] , and the inhibition of p38 activation hindered satellite cells entering the cell cycle . By regulating cell cycle progression , the activated PI3K / Akt , p38 , and ERK1 / 2 fulfilled the Figure 5 . IGF - 1 recombinant peptide alleviated 20 % stretch - induced proliferation inhibition of L6 myoblasts ( A ) , accompanied with the increase of IGF - 1R protein level ( B ) as well as enhancements of PI3K / Akt ( C ) and MAPKs ( p38 and ERK1 / 2 ) ( D ) activities . L6 myoblasts were treated with different concentrations ( 26 , 66 , or 132 mM ) of IGF - 1 recombinant peptide 1 h prior to 20 % cyclic mechanical stretch . Culture medium was replaced with fresh medium immediately after stretch ﬁnished and cultured for a further 24 h , then the proliferation of L6 myoblasts was determined by CCK8 ( Figure 5A ) , and the protein level of IGF - 1R ( Figure 5B ) , as well as the expressions and activities of PI3K / Akt ( ( Figure 5C ) and MAPKs ( p38 , ERK1 / 2 ) ( Figure 5D ) were detected by Western blot . All experiments were repeated three times ( mean ± SD , n = 3 ) . The OD results of three independent experiments were compared , and are shown in Figure 5A . The results of Western blot were representative of at least three independent experiments , as shown in Figure 5B – D . The values are expressed as fold of CON and represent means ± SD . * p < 0 . 05 vs . CON ; # p < 0 . 05 vs . 20 % stretch .

Discussion Cellular responses to mechanical stimulus vary not only with parameters of applied mechanical stretch , such as magnitude , frequency , and duration , but also depending on the type of cells being stretched , so on the basis of pro - proliferation of 15 % mechanical stretch ( 6 h at 0 . 5 Hz ) and anti - proliferation of 20 % stretches ( 6 h at 0 . 5 Hz ) on mouse C2C12 myoblasts from our previous study [ 9 ] , one purpose of the present study was to detect the inﬂuence of similar stretches on rat L6 myoblasts . We found that 15 % and 20 % mechanical stretches lasting for 6 h at 0 . 5 Hz promoted and inhibited the proliferation of rat L6 myoblasts respectively , similar to C2C12 myoblasts , which suggested the universality of stretch - induced proliferation changes in myoblasts . To our knowledge , this is the ﬁrst report about the effects of mechanical stretch on the proliferation of L6 myoblasts . PI3K / Akt and MAPKs ( p38 and ERK1 / 2 ) exert considerable roles on exercise - regulated skeletal muscle mass by regulating cell cycle progression . It has been reported that PI3K / Akt , a master cascade signal in satellite cells or myoblasts , regulated G1 / S cell cycle progression by altering the levels and activities of cell cycle regulators [ 14 , 19 ] . Similarly , ERK1 / 2 activation by low frequency pulsed electromagnetic ﬁeld was also shown to be crucial for the transition from G1 to S phase in Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2018 , 19 , 1649 8 of 12 C2C12 myoblasts [ 23 ] , and the inhibition of p38 activation hindered satellite cells entering the cell cycle . By regulating cell cycle progression , the activated PI3K / Akt , p38 , and ERK1 / 2 fulﬁlled the pro - proliferation of appropriate stretch on stretched cells . For example , 5 % stretch at 0 . 1 Hz induced a remarkable increase of proliferative activity in smooth muscle cells via PI3K [ 24 ] ; 18 % mechanical stretch for 6 h also activates PI3K / Akt in aortic smooth muscle cells [ 13 ] ; and 10 % stretch cyclic mechanical stretch stimulated C2C12 myoblasts proliferation via prolonged activation of p38 MAPK while stimulating bovine satellite cell proliferation through activation of ERK1 / 2 . Our previous study demonstrated the pro - proliferative effect of 15 % stretch at 0 . 5 Hz was mediated by the activations of PI3K / Akt , p38 , and ERK1 / 2 in C2C12 myoblasts [ 9 ] . In the present study , we found that 15 % cyclic mechanical stretch promoted the proliferation of L6 myoblasts , accompanied with PI3K / Akt and ERK1 / 2 activations , but not p38 activation , furthermore , PI3K and ERK1 / 2 inhibitors , instead of p38 inhibitor , attenuated 15 % stretch - induced pro - proliferation of L6 myoblasts , which indicated the pro - proliferation of 15 % stretch on L6 myoblasts was mediated by PI3K / Akt and ERK1 / 2 activations , rather than p38 activation . These results were not totally the same as those of C2C12 in p38 activation , which might be associated with the different cell type . Similarly , the difference between C2C12 and L6 myoblasts was also found in response to extracellular stimuli , such as small molecule pharmacology and hormone [ 25 ] . As mentioned in the introduction , IGF - 1 / IGF - 1R signaling pathway plays a key role in regulating skeletal muscle mass . Resistance training , the most useful treatment for the loss of muscle mass and strength in aging people , was determined to upregulate IGF - 1 and IGF - 1R expression levels [ 26 ] , and skeletal muscle - speciﬁc IGF - 1 overexpression promoted myoﬁber hyperplasia [ 27 ] . It is worth mention that IGF - 1 is upstream of PI3K / Akt and MAPKs ( p38 and ERK1 / 2 ) in regulating cell proliferation , for example , ERK1 / 2 and PI3K / AKT pathways both mediate the stimulatory effect of IGF - 1 on myoblast proliferation [ 14 ] , and IGF - 1 prevents simvastatin - induced myotoxicity in C2C12 myotubes through IGF - 1R - Akt [ 28 ] , and IGF - I induced proliferation of L6 myoblasts via the mediation of IGF - 1R regulated activations of PI3K / Akt and ERK1 / 2 pathways [ 29 ] . Moreover , addition of PI3K ( LY294002 ) , Akt ( KP372 - 1 ) , and ERK1 / 2 ( PD98059 ) speciﬁc inhibitors completely blockaded the pro - proliferative effect of IGF - 1 [ 14 , 19 ] . Our previous study also demonstrated that 15 % mechanical stretch induced C2C12 myoblasts to secrete IGF - 1 , then increased PI3K / Akt and MAPK ( p38 and ERK1 / 2 ) activities through the mediation of IGF - 1R , and thus promoted the proliferation of C2C12 myoblasts [ 9 ] . In the present study , it was surprising to ﬁnd that 15 % stretch had no effect on inducing IGF - 1 secretion of L6 myoblasts , which is totally different from C2C12 myoblasts . In addition , 15 % stretch on L6 myoblasts enhanced the protein level of IGF - 1R , similar to C2C12 myoblasts . Considering the important role of IGF - 1R on IGF - 1 signal , we speculated that 15 % stretch - induced increases of PI3K / Akt and ERK1 / 2 activities in L6 myoblasts were mediated by IGF - 1R , despite no detectable IGF - 1 secretion . Further study is needed to thoroughly clarify the effect of IGF - 1R on PI3K / Akt and ERK1 / 2 activations using IGF - 1R speciﬁc inhibitor ( such as picropodophyllin ) . However , excessive stretch or overstretch inhibited cell proliferation . The only report about the anti - proliferation of overstretch was our previous study , which indicated that anti - proliferation of 20 % stretch on C2C12 myoblasts was likely to be mediated by attenuated activations of PI3K / Akt , p38 , and ERK1 / 2 [ 9 ] . In the present study , the same result was achieved , and indicated that anti - proliferation of 20 % stretch on L6 myoblasts might be mediated by decreased activations of PI3K / Akt , p38 , and ERK1 / 2 , and no cell difference between L6 and C2C12 myoblasts . Furthermore , treatment with IGF - 1 recombinant peptide reversed the proliferation inhibition of L6 myoblasts , accompanied with the increase of IGF - 1R protein level , as well as the enhancements of PI3K / Akt , p38 , and ERK1 / 2 activities , which indicated that 20 % stretch - induced proliferation inhibition of L6 myoblast might be associated with the inhibitions of PI3K / Akt , p38 , and ERK1 / 2 activities resulting from the decline of IGF - 1R . There are some strengths and limitations of our study . Some new discoveries were reported : ( 1 ) it is the ﬁrst report about the cyclic mechanical stretch on the proliferation of L6 myoblasts ; ( 2 ) 15 % Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2018 , 19 , 1649 9 of 12 stretch has no effect on the IGF - 1 secretion of L6 myoblast and the pro - proliferation of 15 % stretch is unrelated to p38 pathway , which are totally different from that observed in C2C12 myoblasts ; ( 3 ) the stretch - induced proliferation alterations of L6 myoblast may be mediated by alterations in PI3K / Akt and MAPK activations regulated by IGF - 1R , despite no detectable IGF - 1 from stretched L6 myoblasts . The limitation of the study was short of the results about the inﬂuence of IGF - 1R speciﬁc inhibitor on the activations of PI3K / Akt and MAPKs in 15 % stretched L6 myoblast , so we failed to thoroughly verify the mediation of IGF - 1R in 15 % stretch - induced activations of PI3K / Akt and MAPKs . In conclusion , 15 % cyclic mechanical stretch promoted , while 20 % stretch inhibited the proliferation of L6 myoblasts . The stretch - modulated proliferation was likely to be attributed to the changes of PI3K / Akt and MAPKs activations regulated by IGF - 1R , despite no detectable IGF - 1 from stretched L6 myoblasts . These results provide theoretical support for stretch - induced increase in skeletal muscle mass and overstretch - induced decrease in skeletal muscle mass . 4 . Materials and Methods 4 . 1 . Cell Culture Rat L6 myoblasts were purchased from Chinese Academy of Sciences ( Shanghai , China ) , and were maintained in Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium ( DMEM ) ( Gibco , Grand Island , NY , USA ) , containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( Gibco , USA ) , and 100 U / mL penicillin and 100 µ g / mL streptomycin , at 37 ◦ C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere containing 5 % CO 2 . L6 cells at low passages ( P3 to P8 ) were used in all the experiments . 4 . 2 . Cyclic Mechanical Stretch The stretch model of L6 myoblasts in vitro was established using computer - controlled cell stretching equipment ( Flexcell FX - 5000TM Tension System , FlexCell International Corporation , Burlington , NC , USA ) . Brieﬂy , L6 cells were seeded onto ﬂexible - bottom six - well plates coated with type - I collagen ( BioFlex , FlexCell International Corporation , USA ) at a density of 1 × 10 5 cells / mL in culture medium and incubated for 24 h . The cells were then subjected to cyclic strain ( 15 % or 20 % deformation ) at 0 . 5 Hz ( 1 s of stretch , 1 s of relax ) for 6 h . Cells cultured under the same conditions without any mechanical cyclic were considered as control . 4 . 3 . Detection of Cell Proliferation After stretch ﬁnished , culture medium was replaced with fresh medium and incubated for 24 h , then Cell Counting Kit - 8 reagents ( Dojindo Laboratories , Kumamoto , Japan ) were added into the medium in proportion , followed by further incubation for 2 h . The optical density ( OD ) values were detected at 450 nm using a microplate reader ( Biotek , Winooski , VT , USA ) . 4 . 4 . Determination of IGF - 1 Concentration in Cell Culture Supernatant After stretch ﬁnished , culture medium was immediately replaced using DMEM with or without fetal bovine serum , and incubated for 24 h , then the culture medium was collected and centrifuged at 12 , 000 rmp for 5 min at 4 ◦ C . IGF - 1 concentration of the supernatant was detected by IGF - 1 ELISA Kit ( Mouse / Rat IGF - 1 Quantikine ELISA Kit , MG100 , R & D Systems Inc . , Minneapolis , MN , USA ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . 4 . 5 . Treatments of L6 Myoblasts with IGF - 1 Recombinant Peptide , and Speciﬁc Inhibitors of PI3K , p38 , and ERK1 / 2 To verify the role of PI3K , p38 , and ERK1 / 2 in L6 myoblasts proliferation induced by cyclic mechanical stretch , different concentration ( 20 , 40 , or 60 µ M ) of speciﬁc inhibitors of PI3K ( LY294002 ) , p38 ( 203580 ) , and ERK1 / 2 ( U0126 ) were added into the culture medium and incubated for 2 h prior to 15 % cyclic mechanical stretch . In order to testify the role of IGF - 1 in the proliferation of L6 myoblasts Int . J . Mol . Sci . 2018 , 19 , 1649 10 of 12 regulated by cyclic mechanical stretch and its associations with PI3K / Akt and MAPKs protein levels and activities , IGF - 1 recombinant peptide ( 26 , 66 , or 132 mM ) was added into the medium before cells were subjected to 15 % or 20 % cyclic mechanical stretch . 4 . 6 . Western Blot Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer ( Beyotime Biotechnology , Shanghai , China ) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors ( Beyotime Biotechnology , Shanghai , China ) at 24 h after stretch ﬁnished , and centrifuged at 12 , 000 rpm for 20 min at 4 ◦ C , then the protein concentration was determined using enhanced bicinchoninic acid assay kit ( Beyotime Biotechnology , China ) . Protein loading buffer ( 5 × ; Sangon Biotech , Shanghai , Shanghai , China ) was added into the lysates prior to denaturation on bath incubator for 10 min . A total of 50 µ g protein was electrophoresed on 10 % SDS - PAGE gels , then transferred to polyvinylidene ﬂuoride ( PVDF ) membrane and blocked in 5 % non - fat milk for 2 h at room temperature , then incubated at 4 ◦ C overnight with primary antibody , such as IGF - 1R ( AF - 305 , 1 : 500 ) ( R & D Systems Inc . ) , PI3K ( 4257P , 1 : 1000 ) , p - PI3K ( p85 ( Tyr 458 ) / p55 ( Tyr 199 ) , 4228S , 1 : 1000 ) , Akt ( 4691P , 1 : 1000 ) , p - Akt ( Ser 473 , 4060S , 1 : 1000 ) , p38 ( 8690P , 1 : 1000 ) , p - p38 MAPK ( Thr 180 / Tyr 182 , 4511S , 1 : 1000 ) , p44 / 42 MAPK ( 4695P , 1 : 1000 ) , or p - p44 / 42 MAPK ( Thr 202 / Tyr 204 , 4370P , 1 : 1000 ) ( Cell Signaling Technology , Danvers , MA , USA ) . Then , the PVDF membranes were rinsed three times with TBST ( 5 min / wash ) and incubated with horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) - conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature , and subsequently , the membranes were rinsed three times as described above , prior to visualization by automatic chemiluminescence apparatus ( Tanon Biotechnology , Shanghai , China ) , and the densities of bands were analyzed by Image J software . 4 . 7 . Statistical Analyses All the experiments were repeated at least three times , the data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) . Statistical analyses were performed using one - way ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc comparing by SPSS 21 . 0 ( IBM Corporation , Armonk , NY , USA ) , and p < 0 . 05 was considered as a signiﬁcant difference .
