Abstract The GTPase dynamin is essential for CME ( clathrin - mediated endocytosis ) , but its exact function and mechanism of action have been controversial . Here , we review ﬁndings that have led to the current models for dynamin function , either as a mechanochemical enzyme driving membrane ﬁssion or as a regulatory GTPase monitoring rate - limiting steps in CME . However , these models are not mutually exclusive and subsequent studies have provided evidence for both dynamin functions . Recent evidence derived from divergent in vivo and in vitro approaches suggests that dynamin plays a dual role in CME , functioning at early stages as a ﬁdelity monitor to regulate clathrin - coated pit maturation and at later stages to directly catalyse membrane ﬁssion and clathrin - coated vesicle formation . Introduction The GTPase dynamin controls several distinct endocytic pathways , with CME ( clathrin - mediated endocytosis ) being the best studied . These dynamin - mediated endocytic pathways function critically in many aspects of cell and organismal physiology , including nutrient uptake , immune presentation , regulation of signal transduction pathways , synaptic vesicle recycling and regulation of surface transporters to control serum homoeostasis [ 1 ] . Dynamin is a 96 kDa multidomain GTPase ( Figure 1 ) that is composed of an N - terminal catalytic GTPase domain , a middle domain involved in assembly [ 2 ] and intracellular targeting [ 3 ] , a PH ( pleckstrin homology ) domain that binds to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and other phosphatidylinositol lipids [ 4 ] , a GED ( GTPase effector domain ) required for self - assembly and assembly - stimulated GTPase activity [ 5 ] and a C - terminal PRD ( proline / arginine - rich domain ) that binds to several SH3 domain ( Src homology 3 domain ) - containing protein partners [ 6 ] . Dynamin is an atypical GTPase that binds GTP with low affinity and hydrolyses GTP at a robust basal rate of ∼ 1 min − 1 [ 7 ] . Dynamin’s GTPase activity can be stimulated > 100 - fold upon self - assembly into helical arrays on lipid templates [ 8 ] . Despite dynamin’s clear importance in CME andextensiveresearchoverthepast15 years , aclearconsensus regarding its exact role and mechanism of action is yet to emerge .

Dynamin was ﬁrst identiﬁed as an MT ( microtubule ) - based motor protein ‘Dynamin’ ( derived from ‘dynamic’ ) was named to reflect its molecular motor - like properties [ 9 ] . Indeed , it was first isolated as an MT - binding protein that was released in the presence of ATP and exhibited MT - dependent ATPase activity . Dynamin bundled MTs and upon addition of ATP caused them to slide past each other [ 9 ] , although this latter activity required the presence of a side fraction later suspected to harbour nucleoside diphosphokinase activity , as well as other motor contaminants [ 10 ] . Two surprises followed this initial study . Cloning and sequencing of dynamin revealed it to be a member of the GTPase superfamily , and not an ATP - dependent motor protein as originally thought [ 11 ] . Subsequently , dynamin was found to be 70 % identical with shibire [ 12 , 13 ] , a Drosophila gene product linked to synaptic vesicle recycling and endocytosis . As MTs are not present in the synapse , a requirement for an MT - based motor in synaptic vesicle endocytosis was unexpected . To determine whether mammalian dynamin was indeed required for endocytosis and whether its function was related to potential MT motor activities , we cloned human dynamin and generated and characterized the effects of overexpression of the now widely used dyn ( K44A ) mutant [ 14 ] . We chose this mutation because Lys 44 is present in the active site P - loop conserved in both GTPases and ATP - dependent motor pro - teins : lysine → alanine mutations decrease nucleotide binding and generate dominant - negative mutants of both classes of proteins . In the case of motor proteins , such as kinesin , the protein is locked in the ‘rigor’ state and binds tightly to MTs when expressed in vivo [ 15 ] . Our analyses of stable cell lines expressing dyn ( K44A ) under the inducible tetracycline - expression system revealed that dynamin was selectively requiredforCMEandnotforgeneralfluid - phaseuptake [ 16 ] . Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that endogenous dy - namin was localized to CCPs ( clathrin - coated pits ) on the cell C (cid:4) The Authors Journal compilation C (cid:4) 2009 Biochemical Society Biochem . Soc . Trans .

Dynamin exists in solution as a tetramer . surface . Importantly , we found no effect on MT structure and no association of dyn ( K44A ) with MTs in these cells , suggest - ing that this in vitro interaction may not be relevant in vivo . Two models for dynamin function in endocytosis Having firmly established dynamin’s role in CME , we and others have since endeavoured to understand its mechanism of action . The discovery that purified recombinant dynamin self - assembles into rings and helical stacks of rings [ 17 ] and the localization of dynamin to collar - like structures that accumulate on membranes of permeabilized synaptosomes treated with the non - hydrolysable GTP analogue , GTP [ S ] ( guanosine 5 (cid:5) - [ γ - thio ] triphosphate ) [ 18 ] , led us to propose a model ( Figure 2A ) in which dynamin , triggered by GTP binding , assembles at the necks of invaginated coated pits , causing constriction . We proposed that subsequent assembly - stimulated GTP hydrolysis causes a concerted conforma - tional change to generate force required for membrane fission [ 17 , 19 ] . Thismodelwasconsistentwithpreviousfindingsthat non - hydrolysable GTP analogues supported the formation of constricted coated pits in perforated cells , and that GTP hydrolysis was required for vesicle formation [ 20 ] . In a series of studies to test this hypothesis and further explore the mechanism of dynamin function , we showed that dynamin self - assembly in solution indeed stimulates its GTPase activity , that self - assembly is regulated by GTP binding and hydrolysis and that guanine nucleotides regulate the distribution of dynamin on CCPs [ 21 – 23 ] . Through limited proteolysis , we identified a distal domain of dynamin , termed the GED , that was required for self - assembly and assembly - stimulated GTPase activity [ 24 ] and showed that isolated recombinant GED could stimulate dynamin’s GT - Pase activity [ 5 ] . Using this Escherichia coli - expressed GED as a facile platform for mutagenesis , we were able to identify two GED mutants ( K694A and R725A ) that selectively impaired self - assembly , and hence dynamin’s assembly - stimulated GTPase activity , without affecting GTP binding or dynamin’s basal rate of GTP hydrolysis [ 5 ] . The assembly - dependent activation of GED provided a mechanism by which self - assembly could be coupled with GTP hydrolysis to generate the mechanochemical force we had hypothesized was required for membrane fission . However , we were once Figure 2 Two models for dynamin function in CME ( A ) Model 1 : dynamin functions as a mechanochemical GTPase . GTP binding triggers dynamin assembly into collars and co - ordinated , assembly - stimulated GTP hydrolysis triggers a concerted conformation change to mediate ﬁssion . ( B ) Model 2 : dynamin functions as a regulatory GTPase . GTP - bound dynamin controls effectors that mediate vesicle formation . Self - assembly activates an internal GAP domain ( GED ) that negatively regulates dynamin function and terminates dynamin – effector interactions . again surprised to find that overexpression of these GED mutants ( DynK694A and DynR725A ) stimulated rather than inhibited CME [ 5 , 25 ] . These findings strongly suggested that dynamin , like most other GTPase superfamily members , was negatively regulated by self - assembly and GED - accelerated GTP hydrolysis . Based on these unexpected findings , we proposed a second model in which dynamin functions as a regulatory GTPase ( Figure 2B ) . Asoriginallyformulated , thesetwomodelswereseemingly incompatible and consequently there has been much debate regarding their respective merits [ 26 – 30 ] . However , these models are not mutually exclusive . Indeed , considerable evidence has now accumulated to support both aspects of dynamin function . Experimental evidence supporting dynamin’s role in membrane ﬁssion In support of a mechanochemical function in fission , the Hinshaw and the De Camilli groups showed that dynamin binds to liposomes , causes tubulation and undergoes force - generating conformational changes upon GTP binding and hydrolysis [ 31 , 32 ] . The nature of the conformational change observed , however , was dependent on the assay conditions . Hence , when bound either to phosphatidylserine liposomes [ 31 ] or to liposomes composed of brain polar lipids supplemented with PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , assembled dynamin underwent a constriction that apparently resulted in vesiculation of the dynamin - coated tubules as detected by changes in light scattering and electron microscopy [ 31 , 33 ] . However , later studies showed that the vesiculation observed C (cid:4) The Authors Journal compilation C (cid:4) 2009 Biochemical Society 1024 Biochemical Society Transactions ( 2009 ) Volume 37 , part 5 after electron microscopy analysis may have been an artefact duetoconstrainingthetubulesonanadherentsurface [ 34 , 35 ] , and that the changes in light scattering may have reflected GTP - dependent dissociation of dynamin from the membrane tubules [ 35a ] . A distinct global conformation change was observed when dynamin was assembled on to more rigid PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing lipid nanotubules . In this case , GTP hydrolysis caused an increase in helical pitch suggested to cause vesicle release [ 8 ] . Finally , a third mechanochemical activity of dynamin was observed in which GTP hydrolysis caused assembled dynamin molecules to undergo a rotation around coated membrane tubules . This twisting action was proposed to drive fission of the underlying membrane [ 35 ] , but only if external tension was applied to hold the membrane tubule taut . Despite their differences , a clear consensus emerged from these studies that dynamin is a mechanochemical enzyme , but that this mechanochemical activity on its own was insufficient to drive membrane fission . Each of these nucleotide - driven conformational changes were observed on addition of GTP after preassembling long dynamin spirals on lipid templates . Using fluorescence - based assays to study the dynamic interaction of dynamin with liposomes , we found that GTP triggered the rapid disassembly of preassembled dynamin [ 35a ] . Under more physiological conditions , in the constant presence of GTP , dynamin undergoes continuous cycles of assembly , GTP hydrolysis and disassembly . To examine dynamin’s potential role in membrane fission , we developed a versatile new assay usingSUPER ( supportedlipidbilayerswithexcessmembrane reservoir ) templates on 5 μ m silica beads . These templates enable us to both visualize dynamin’s effects on the adsorbed lipid bilayer and to quantitatively measure membrane fission by the release of fluorescently labelled lipids into the supernatant of a low - speed spin . We found that when dynamin was added to SUPER templates in the constant presence of GTP - mirroring physiological conditions , it catalysed multiple rounds of fission and the release of small vesicles ( 70 – 90 nm in diameter ) into the supernatant . By contrast , if we incubated dynamin with SUPER templates in the absence of nucleotides , dynamin generated long membrane tubules that remained attached to the beads . Addition of GTP led to the rapid dissociation of dynamin and retraction of the tubules without fission , unless they were tethered and hence ruptured on retraction [ 36 ] . Dynamin could be visualized during fission events and it was seen to form short collar - like structures at the necks of budding vesicles prior to fission . Complementary electrophysiological studies using membrane tubules drawn from a lipid reservoir and theoretical analyses confirmed that preassembled dynamin was unable to mediate fission and that dynamin - catalysed membrane fission occurred stochastically during cycles of squeezing and relaxation of short dynamin collars [ 36a ] . Together , these studies establish a direct role for dynamin in catalysing membrane fission . It is likely that other factors , such as coat proteins and potentially curvature - generating and / or - stabilizing BAR - domain - containing ac - cessory factors , function together with dynamin to regulate membrane fission and to enhance its efficiency . Experimental evidence supporting a role for dynamin in regulating CME CME requires dynamin’s GTPase activity and its ability to undergo GTP - dependent conformational changes [ 37 – 39 ] . It has been argued that these requirements support a mechanochemical role for dynamin in CME [ 39 ] ; however , all GTPases , including signalling GTPases such as Ras and G α , require these properties for correct cellular function . What distinguishes signalling GTPases from mechanochemical enzymes is that their activities are negatively regulated by accelerated GTP hydrolysis . Thus the strongest evidence for a regulatory role for dynamin in endocytosis derives from genetic studies in Drosophila . In a screen for suppressors of the shi ts2 allele , Ramaswami et al . [ 40 ] isolated four Sushi ( suppressor of shibire ) mutants that mapped to the shibire allele [ 40 ] . The original shi ts2 mutation corresponds to G146S in the conserved switch 2 region of the GTPase domain that , for other GTPases , is involved in nucleotide - dependent interactions with effectors and / or GAPs ( GTPase - activating proteins ) . Strikingly , two second - site Sushi mutations that fully rescue dynamin function in vivo mapped to dynamin’s GED [ 41 ] . Biochemical analysis of purified dynamin bearing the single ts2 GTPase domain mutant revealed a temperature - sensitive defect in GTP binding that correlated with the temperature - sensitive loss of function in vivo [ 41 ] . As expec - ted , neither of the second - site Sushi mutations in GED ( i . e . G146S / A738T or G146S / T749I ) corrected the GTP binding defect ; instead these mutations impaired dynamin’s basal and assembly - stimulated GTPase activities without altering dynamin’s ability to self - assemble . The finding that reduced GTPase activity restores the function of a GTP - binding - impaired mutant protein suggests , as for other regulatory GTPases , that accelerated GTP hydrolysis , which is depend - ent on GED function , negatively regulates dynamin function in vivo . Dynamin’s function in regulating early stages of endocyt - osis has also been directly detected using quantitative live cell TIRF ( total internal reflection fluorescence ) microscopy to monitor CCP maturation and CCV ( clathrin - coated vesicle ) formation . Using new particle tracking and gap - closing algorithms [ 42 ] , we were able to establish an unbiased and complete inventory of CCP trajectories visible by TIRF mi - croscopy [ 43 ] . Statistical analyses of the lifetime distributions identified three dynamically distinct CCP subpopulations : two short - lived subpopulations corresponding to aborted in - termediates and one longer - lived productive subpopulation . The proportion of productive CCPs increased on overex - pression of transferrin receptor , a model cargo molecule , at the expense of abortive species and in a manner dependent on AP2 ( adaptor protein 2 ) concentration . Partial knockdown of dynamin - 2 prolonged the lifetime of productive CCPs , consistent with previous findings showing that dynamin controlled rate - limiting steps in CME [ 25 ] . Interestingly , C (cid:4) The Authors Journal compilation C (cid:4) 2009 Biochemical Society The Dynamic Cell 1025 Figure 3 Dynamin plays a dual role in clathrin - mediated function ( A ) We propose a new reconciliatory model for dynamin function and suggest that dynamin plays a dual role in CME with sequential function . Dynamin functions in early , rate - limiting stages of CCP maturation as a regulatory GTPase / ﬁdelity monitor that receives input from SH3 domain - containing partners that monitor coat assembly , cargo concentration and curvature generation . Subsequently , dynamin functions as a self - limited , assembly - stimulated GTPase collar that catalyses membrane ﬁssion . ( B ) We propose that self - assembly ( the ‘switch’ between dynamin functional states ) is regulated by SH3 domain - containing dynamin partners that sense critical events in CCV maturation . Through other partners , dynamin might also trigger late events in CME such as actin polymerization or uncoating . dynamin knockdown also prolonged the lifetime of abortive CCPsandreconstitutionwithwild - typeandmutantdynamin molecules increased or decreased the turnover of abortive CCPs in a manner dependent on basal GTP binding and hydrolysis properties . From these results , we have inferred the existence of an endocytic ‘restriction - ’ or ‘check - point’ that monitors and gates CCP maturation and governs the rate of CME [ 43 ] . In the course of CCV formation , dynamin interacts with numerous SH3 domain - containing proteins , whose other domains interact with coat proteins [ e . g . amphiphysin and SNX9 ( sorting nexin 9 ) ] , cargo molecules [ e . g . Grb2 ( growth - factor - receptor - bound protein 2 ) and SNX9 ] and / or sense and generate membrane curvature ( e . g . amphiphysin , endophilin , SNX9 and syndapin ) . Thus we propose that these binding partners function as sensors that respond to upstream molecular events and determine progression beyond the dynamin - governed restriction point . A dual role for dynamin in endocytic CCV formation To reconcile these collective findings , we propose a model in which dynamin plays a dual role in CME ( Figure 3 ) . We suggest that early , rate - limiting steps of endocytosis are controlled by unassembled dynamin , which is targeted to coated pits and functions either as a timer , a fidelity monitor and / or to ensure vectoriality over the processes of coat assembly , cargo capture and membrane curvature formation . This early function of unassembled dynamin depends on its basal rate of GTP hydrolysis and is negatively regulated by GED . At late stages of CCV formation , dynamin self - assembles into a short , transient collar around the neck of deeply invaginated , fully mature coated pits and catalyses membrane fission . Implicit in this model is that the ‘switch’ of dynamin from one functional state to another corresponds not to GDP dissociation , GTP binding and hydrolysis , as for classical GTPases , but to an acute transition from the unas - sembled to the assembled state . This assembly switch should be tightly regulated and further work is necessary to identify factors , which presumably include dynamin’s SH3 domain - containing partners , that impinge on this critical transition .
