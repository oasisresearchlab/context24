SWELL1 ( LRRC8a ) ablation 39 impairs adipose and skeletal muscle insulin - pAKT2 signaling , b - cell insulin secretion and glycemic 40 control - suggesting that SWELL1 - LRRC8 complex dysfunction contributes to T2D pathogenesis . 41 Here , we show that I Cl , SWELL and SWELL1 protein are reduced in adipose and b - cells in murine 42 and human T2D . Combining cryo - electron microscopy , molecular docking , medicinal chemistry , 43 and functional studies , we define a structure activity relationship to rationally - designed active 44 derivatives ( SN - 40X ) of a SWELL1 channel inhibitor ( DCPIB / SN - 401 ) , that bind the SWELL1 - 45 LRRC8 hexameric complex , restore SWELL1 - LRRC8 protein , plasma membrane trafficking , 46 signaling and islet insulin secretion via SWELL1 - dependent mechanisms . In vivo , SN - 401 and 47 active SN - 40X compounds restore glycemic control and prevents NAFLD by improving insulin - 48 sensitivity and insulin secretion in murine T2D . These findings demonstrate that small molecule 49 SWELL1 modulators restore SWELL1 - dependent insulin - sensitivity and insulin secretion in T2D 50 and may represent a first - in - class therapeutic approach for T2D and NAFLD . 51 52 53 54 Introduction 55 Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2D ) is a globally ubiquitous metabolic disease characterized by 56 hyperglycemia that is caused by reduced insulin sensitivity in target tissues and impaired insulin 57 secretion from pancreatic β - cells 1 - 3 . T2D accounts for 90 - 95 % of all diabetes mellitus in the US , 58 or about 24 M people 4 . It is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease , renal 59 disease , liver disease , cancer , and infection and a hazard ratio for all - cause mortality of 1 . 80 60 compared to patients without T2D 5 , 6 . The cost of medical care for patients with diabetes is 2 . 3 - 61 fold the cost in non - diabetics . In 2017 , the direct medical cost of diabetes in the US was $ 237B 7 . 62 63 There are at least ten distinct classes of medications approved to treat T2D : sulfonylureas , 64 meglitinides , amylin mimetics , biguanides , alpha - glucosidase inhibitors , thiazolidinediones , 65 glucagon - like peptide - 1 analogs ( GLP - 1a ) , dipeptidyl peptidase - 4 inhibitors ( DPPi ) , sodium - 66 glucose co - transporter ( SGLT ) - 2 inhibitors ( SGLT2i ) , and insulin . Despite this diverse array of 67 T2D medications , there are several reasons why new medications for T2D are needed . First , 68 cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) is the leading cause of death in diabetics 8 , 9 , and although newer 69 T2D medications like SGLT2i and GLP - 1a effect a reduction in CVD mortality , significant residual 70 CVD mortality remains 10 , which presents a therapeutic opportunity for T2D medications with novel 71 mechanisms of action . Second , 25 - 33 % of T2D patients have inadequate glycemic control , with 72 HbA1c levels above guideline recommendations 6 , 11 - 14 . This poor glucose control is associated 73 with increasing risk of death from vascular causes , non - vascular causes and cancer 8 . Third , T2D 74 medication - induced hypoglycemia remains a significant problem for patients with T2D , especially 75 with patients on multiple T2D medications 4 15 , 16 . For all these reasons , there remains sustained 76 interest in developing new T2D and metabolic syndrome therapeutics , especially with novel 77 mechanisms of action 17 . 78 79 SWELL1 or LRRC8a ( Leucine - Rich Repeat Containing Protein 8a ) encodes a transmembrane 80 protein first described in 2003 as the site of a balanced translocation in an immunodeficient child 81 with agammaglobulinemia and absent B - cells 18 , 19 . Subsequent work revealed that this condition 82 was caused by impaired SWELL1 - dependent GRB2 - PI3K - AKT signaling in lymphocytes , 83 resulting in a developmental block in lymphocyte differentiation 20 . So , for about a decade , 84 SWELL1 was considered a membrane protein that regulates PI3K - AKT mediated lymphocyte 85 function 18 , 19 , and it was not until 2014 that SWELL1 / LRRC8a was discovered to also form an 86 essential component of the volume - regulated anion channel ( VRAC ) 21 , 22 , forming hetero - 87 hexamers with LRRC8b - e 22 , 23 . Therefore , historically , the SWELL1 - LRRC8 complex was first 88 described as a membrane protein that participated in non - ion channel mediated protein - protein 89 signaling ( non - conductive signaling ) and then later found to form an ion channel complex with ion 90 conductive signaling properties . Indeed , prior work highlights each of these modes of SWELL1 - 91 LRRC8 channel complex signaling . We showed previously SWELL1 to mediate insulin - PI3K - AKT 92 signaling in adipocytes and skeletal muscle via non - conductive signaling mechanisms , and 93 thereby regulates insulin - sensitivity , by modulating GRB2 signaling 24 - 26 . Also , we and others 94 showed SWELL1 - LRRC8 channel activity ( conductive signaling ) in the pancreatic b - cell is 95 required for normal insulin secretion 27 , 28 . Thus , SWELL1 - LRRC8 loss - of - function both down - 96 regulates insulin signaling in target tissues 24 , 29 and insulin secretion from the pancreatic b - cell 27 , 28 97 inducing a state of glucose intolerance 24 , 27 , 29 . Since Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) is characterized by 98 both a loss of insulin sensitivity of target tissues ( fat , skeletal muscle , liver ) and ultimately , 99 impaired insulin secretion from the pancreatic b - cell 1 - 3 , these data raised the question : could 100 impaired SWELL1 - mediated signaling contribute to T2D pathogenesis , and if so , could this be 101 corrected pharmacologically to improve systemic glycemia ? 102 103 In this study , we provide evidence that SWELL1 - mediated currents and SWELL1 protein are 104 reduced in murine and human adipocytes and pancreatic β - cells in the setting of T2D and 105 hyperglycemia suggesting that dysfunctional SWELL1 - mediated signaling could contribute to T2D 106 pathogenesis by impairing insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion . Next , we identify a small 107 molecule modulator , DCPIB ( renamed SN - 401 ) , as a tool compound that binds the SWELL1 - 108 LRRC8 complex 30 , and potentially functions as a chemical chaperone to augment SWELL1 109 expression and plasma membrane trafficking at concentrations > 90 % lower than its IC 50 of ~ 5 110 µM for I Cl , SWELL31 . In vivo , SN - 401 normalizes glucose tolerance by increasing insulin sensitivity 111 and secretion in insulin - resistant T2D mouse models , while augmenting tissue glucose uptake , 112 suppressing hepatic glucose production , and greatly reducing hepatic steatosis and hepatocyte 113 damage ( ballooning ) in obese T2D mice . Importantly , while SN - 401 normalizes glycemia in 114 diabetic mice , it has very mild glucose - lowering effects on non - obese euglycemic mice – 115 indicating a low risk of hypoglycemic events associated with other commonly used anti - diabetic 116 therapies , including sulfonylureas and insulin . Combining cryo - EM structure data of SN - 401 117 bound to its target SWELL1 / LRRC8a 30 with molecular docking simulations , and novel cryo - EM 118 structure data of an active SN - 40X congener bound to SWELL1 hexameric channels in lipid 119 nanodiscs , we validate a structure - activity relationship ( SAR ) based approach to generate novel 120 SN - 401 congeners with subtle molecular changes to either enhance or delete on - target activity , 121 both in vitro and in vivo . This approach allows us to attribute the cellular and systemic SN - 40X 122 effects to drug - target binding , while controlling for off - target effects . We propose small molecule 123 SWELL1 modulators may represent a first - in - class therapeutic approach to treat metabolic 124 syndrome and associated diseases by restoring SWELL1 signaling across multiple organ systems 125 that are dysfunctional in T2D . 126 127 128 Results 129 130 131 I Cl , SWELL and SWELL1 protein are reduced in T2D β - cells and adipocytes 132 SWELL1 / LRRC8a ablation impairs insulin signaling in target tissues 24 , 29 and insulin secretion 133 from the pancreatic b - cell 27 , 28 , inducing a pre - diabetic state of glucose intolerance 24 , 27 , 29 . These 134 recent findings suggest that reductions in SWELL1 may contribute to Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) . To 135 determine if SWELL1 - mediated currents are altered in T2D we measured I Cl , SWELL in pancreatic 136 β - cells freshly isolated from T2D mice raised on HFD for 5 - 7 months ( Fig . 1a & c ) and from T2D 137 patients ( Fig . 1b & d , Supplementary Table S1 ) compared to non - T2D controls . In both mouse 138 and human T2D β - cells , the maximum I Cl , SWELL current density ( measured at + 100 mV ) upon 139 stimulation with hypotonic swelling is significantly reduced ( 90 % in murine ; 63 % in human , Fig . 140 1c & d ) compared to non - T2D controls , similar to reductions observed in SWELL1 knock - out 141 ( KO ) and knock - down ( KD ) murine and human β - cells 27 , respectively . As SWELL1 / LRRC8a is a 142 critical component of I Cl , SWELL / VRAC 21 , 22 in both adipose tissue 24 , 29 and β - cells 27 , 28 , we asked 143 whether these reductions in I Cl , SWELL in the setting of T2D 32 are associated with reductions in 144 SWELL1 protein expression . Total SWELL1 protein in diabetic human cadaveric islets 145 ( representing numerous islet cell types ) also shows a trend toward being reduced 50 % 146 compared to islets from non - diabetics ( Fig . 1e , Supplementary Table S2 ) , suggesting that 147 reduced SWELL1 protein may underlie these reductions in I Cl , SWELL currents . 148 149 Curiously , reductions in β - cell I Cl , SWELL observed in the setting of T2D ( Fig . 1a - d ) are consistent 150 with previous measurements of VRAC / I Cl , SWELL in the adipocytes of the murine KKA y T2D 151 model 32 , which are reduced by 60 % in T2D KKA y mice compared to KKA a controls 32 ( Fig . 1f , 152 data plotted from Inoue et al , 2010 32 ) . Similarly , SWELL1 - mediated I Cl , SWELL measured in 153 isolated human adipocytes from an obese T2D patient ( BMI = 52 . 3 , HgbA1c = 6 . 9 % ; Fasting 154 Glucose = 148 - 151 mg / dl ) show a trend toward being reduced 48 % compared to obese , non - 155 T2D patients that we reported previously 24 , and not different from I Cl , SWELL in adipocytes from 156 lean patients ( Fig . 1g , Supplementary Table S3 ) . Consistent with reductions observed in 157 I Cl , SWELL , SWELL1 protein is also reduced ( 38 % ) in adipose tissue of T2D KKA y mice as 158 compared to parental control KKA a mice ( Fig . 1h ) . Similarly , SWELL1 protein is 50 % lower in 159 adipose tissue from obese T2D patients ( HgbA1c > 6 . 0 % ) compared to adipose tissue from 160 normoglycemic obese patients ( HgbA1c < 6 . 0 % Fig . 1i , Supplementary Table S4 ) . Taken 161 together , these findings suggest reduced SWELL1 activity in adipocytes and b - cells ( and 162 possibly other tissues ) may underlie insulin - resistance and impaired insulin secretion associated 163 with T2D . Moreover , SWELL1 protein expression increases in both adipose tissue and liver in 164 the setting of early euglycemic obesity 29 and shRNA - mediated suppression of this SWELL1 165 induction exacerbates insulin - resistance and glucose intolerance 29 . Therefore , we speculate that 166 maintenance or induction of SWELL1 expression / signaling in peripheral tissues may support 167 insulin sensitivity and secretion to preserve systemic glycemia in the setting of T2D . 168 169 SWELL1 protein expression regulates insulin - stimulated PI3K - AKT2 - AS160 signaling 170 To test whether SWELL1 regulates insulin signaling , we re - expressed Flag - tagged SWELL1 171 ( SWELL1 O / E ) in SWELL1 KO 3T3 - F442A adipocytes and measured insulin - stimulated 172 phosphorylated AKT2 ( pAKT2 ) and phosphorylated AS160 ( pAS160 ) as a readout of insulin - 173 signaling ( Fig . 2a & b ) . SWELL1 KO 3T3 - F442A adipocytes exhibit significantly blunted insulin - 174 mediated pAKT2 and pAS160 signaling compared to WT adipocytes , similar to described 175 previously 24 , 26 , and this is fully rescued by re - expression of SWELL1 in SWELL1 KO adipocytes 176 ( KO + SWELL1 O / E , Fig . 2a & b ) 26 . SWELL1 re - expression also recapitulates SWELL1 - mediated 177 I Cl , SWELL in in SWELL1 KO cells in response to hypotonic stimulation ( Fig . 2c and 178 Supplementary Fig . S1a - c ) , which is consistent with restoration of SWELL1 - LRRC8a signaling 179 complexes at the plasma membrane . Notably , the reductions in total AKT2 protein expression 180 observed in SWELL1 KO adipocytes is not rescued by SWELL1 re - expression , indicating that 181 transient changes in SWELL1 protein expression in adipocytes regulates pAKT2 signaling , as 182 opposed to total AKT2 protein expression . We confirmed FLAG - tagged SWELL1 traffics 183 normally to the plasma membrane when expressed in both WT and SWELL1 KO adipocytes 184 visualized by immunofluorescence ( IF ) using anti - FLAG and SWELL1 KO - validated anti - 185 SWELL1 antibodies , respectively ( Supplementary Fig . S1d & e ) . FLAG - tagged SWELL1 186 overexpressed in WT and SWELL1 KO adipocytes assumes a punctate pattern at the cell 187 periphery , similar to endogenous SWELL1 in WT adipocytes . Overall , these data indicate that 188 SWELL1 expression levels regulate insulin - PI3K - AKT2 - AS160 signaling in adipocytes - 189 potentially by modulating GRB2 signaling 20 , 24 - 26 . Furthermore , these data imply that 190 pharmacological SWELL1 induction in peripheral tissues in the setting of T2D may enhance 191 insulin signaling and improve systemic insulin - sensitivity and glycemic control . 192 193 A small molecule binds SWELL1 - LRRC8 channel complexes , increases adipocyte 194 SWELL1 protein expression and SWELL1 - dependent insulin signaling 195 The small molecule 4 - [ ( 2 - Butyl - 6 , 7 - dichloro - 2 - cyclopentyl - 2 , 3 - dihydro - 1 - oxo - 1 H - inden - 5 - 196 yl ) oxy ] butanoic acid ( DCPIB , Fig . 2d ) is among a series of structurally diverse 197 ( acylaryloxy ) acetic acid derivatives , that were synthesized and studied for diuretic properties in 198 the late 1970s 33 , 34 and evaluated in the 1980s as potential treatments for brain edema 35 , 36 . 199 While DCPIB was derived from the FDA - approved diuretic ethacrynic acid , it has minimal 200 diuretic activity 37 , and has instead been used as a selective VRAC / I Cl , SWELL inhibitor 24 , 27 , 31 ( Fig . 201 2e ) , binding at a constriction point within the SWELL1 - LRRC8 hexamer 30 , 38 - 40 . Having 202 demonstrated that SWELL1 is regulates insulin - AKT2 signaling in multiple cell types , including 203 adipocytes 24 , 25 , 29 , skeletal muscle 26 , and endothelium 41 , we anticipated pharmacological 204 inhibition of VRAC / I Cl , SWELL with DCPIB , which we here re - name SN - 401 , would decrease insulin 205 signaling . Unexpectedly , SN - 401 increased SWELL1 protein expression in 3T3 - F442A 206 preadipocytes ( 3 - fold control expression ; Fig . 2f & g ) and adipocytes ( 1 . 5 - fold control expression ; 207 Fig . 2h ) when applied for 96 hours , and was associated with enhanced insulin - stimulated levels 208 of pAKT2 ( Fig . 2f - g & i - j ) , and insulin - stimulated levels of pAS160 ( Fig . 2i & j ) . These SN - 401 - 209 mediated effects on insulin - AKT2 - AS160 signaling are absent in SWELL1 KO 3T3 - F442A 210 adipocytes , consistent with an on - target SWELL1 - mediated mechanism of action for SN - 401 211 ( Fig . 2i & j ) . The SN - 401 - mediated increases in SWELL1 protein expression are not associated 212 with increases in SWELL1 mRNA , nor in the mRNA for other LRRC8 subunits : LRRC8b , 213 LRRC8c , LRRC8d or LRRC8e that form the SWELL1 channel complex ( Supplementary Fig . 214 S2a - c ) , implicating post - transcriptional mechanisms for increased SWELL1 expression and 215 SWELL1 - LRRC8 associated signaling . 216 217 SN - 401 increases SWELL1 and improves systemic glucose homeostasis in murine T2D 218 models by enhancing insulin sensitivity and secretion 219 To determine if SN - 401 improves insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis in vivo we treated 220 two T2D mouse models : obese , HFD - fed mice and the polygenic T2D KKA y mouse model with 221 SN - 401 ( 5 mg / kg i . p . for 4 - 10 days ) . In vivo , SN - 401 augments SWELL1 expression 2 . 3 - fold in 222 adipose tissue of HFD - fed T2D mice ( Fig . 3a ) . Similarly , SN - 401 increases SWELL1 expression 223 in adipose tissue of T2D KKA y mice to levels comparable to both non - T2D C57 / B6 mice and to 224 the parental KKA a parental strain ( Fig . 3b ) . This restoration of SWELL1 expression is 225 associated with normalized fasting blood glucose ( FG ) , glucose tolerance ( GTT ) , and markedly 226 improved insulin - tolerance ( ITT ) in both HFD - induced T2D mice ( Fig . 3c ) and in the polygenic 227 T2D KKAy model ( Fig . 3d - f ) , without significant reductions in body weight ( Supplementary 228 Table S5 ) . Remarkably , treating the control KKA a parental strain with SN - 401 at the same 229 treatment dose ( 5 mg / kg x 4 - 10 days ) does not cause hypoglycemia , nor does it alter glucose 230 and insulin tolerance ( Fig . 3d - f ) . Similarly , lean , non - T2D , glucose - tolerant mice treated with 231 SN - 401 have similar FG , GTT and ITT compared to vehicle - treated mice ( Fig . 3g & h and 232 Supplementary Fig . S3a - c ) . However , when made insulin - resistant and diabetic after 16 weeks 233 of HFD feeding , these same mice ( from Fig . 3g & h ) treated with SN - 401 show marked 234 improvements in FG ( Fig . 3i ) , GTT and ITT ( Fig . 3j ) as compared to vehicle . These data show 235 that SN - 401 restores glucose homeostasis in the setting of T2D , but has little effect on glucose 236 homeostasis in non - T2D mice . Importantly , this portends a low risk for inducing hypoglycemia . 237 SN - 401 was well - tolerated during chronic i . p . injection protocols , with no overt signs of toxicity 238 with daily i . p . injections for up to 8 weeks , despite striking effects on glucose tolerance 239 ( Supplementary Fig . S3d ) . 240 241 To examine the possible contribution of SN - 401 - mediated enhancements in insulin secretion 242 from pancreatic β - cells , we next measured glucose - stimulated insulin secretion ( GSIS ) in SN - 243 401 treated mice subjected to 21 weeks of HFD . We found that the impairments in GSIS 244 commonly observed with long - term HFD ( 21 weeks HFD ) are significantly improved in SN - 401 - 245 treated HFD mice based on serum insulin measurements ( Fig . 3k ) and perifusion GSIS from 246 isolated islets ( Fig . 3l ) , consistent with the predicted effect of SWELL1 induction in pancreatic β - 247 cells 27 , 28 . Similar results are obtained in perfusion assays performed in SN - 401 compared to 248 vehicle treated T2D KKA y mice ( Fig . 3m ) . Collectively , these data suggest that SN - 401 - 249 mediated improvements in systemic glycemia in T2D occur via augmentation of both peripheral 250 insulin sensitivity and β - cell insulin secretion – the inverse phenotype to in vivo loss - of - function 251 studies 24 , 27 - 29 . 252 253 SN - 401 improves systemic insulin sensitivity , tissue glucose uptake , and nonalcoholic 254 fatty liver disease in murine T2D models . 255 To more rigorously evaluate SN - 401 effects on insulin sensitization and glucose metabolism in 256 T2D mice we performed euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps traced with 3 H - glucose and 14 C - 257 deoxyglucose in T2D KKA y mice treated with SN - 401 or vehicle . SN - 401 treated T2D KKA y mice 258 require a higher glucose - infusion rate ( GIR ) to maintain euglycemia compared to vehicle , 259 consistent with enhanced systemic insulin - sensitivity ( Fig . 4a ) . The rate of glucose appearance 260 ( R a ) , which reflects hepatic glucose production from gluconeogenesis and / or glycogenolysis , 261 was reduced 40 % in SN - 401 - treated T2D KKA y mice at baseline ( Basal , Fig . 4b ) , and further 262 suppressed 75 % during glucose / insulin infusion ( Clamp , Fig . 4b ) , revealing SN - 401 increases 263 hepatic insulin sensitivity – similar to thiazolidinediones ( TZD ) 42 . 264 As the SN - 401 - mediated increase in SWELL1 is expected to enhance insulin - pAKT2 - pAS160 265 signaling , GLUT4 plasma membrane translocation , and tissue glucose uptake 24 , we next 266 measured the effect of SN - 401 on glucose uptake in adipose , myocardium and skeletal muscle 267 using 2 - deoxyglucose ( 2 - DG ) . SN - 401 enhanced insulin - stimulated 2 - DG uptake into inguinal 268 white adipose tissue ( iWAT ) , gonadal white adipose tissue ( gWAT ) , and myocardium ( Fig . 4c ) . 269 As SWELL1 ablation markedly reduces insulin - pAKT2 - pGSK3β signaling 24 , 26 , 41 and cellular 270 glycogen content 24 , we asked whether the SN - 401 - mediated increase in SWELL1 would 271 increase glucose incorporation into tissue glycogen in the setting of T2D . Indeed , liver , adipose , 272 and skeletal muscle glucose incorporation into glycogen is markedly increased in SN - 401 - 273 treated mice ( Fig . 4d ) , consistent with a SWELL1 - mediated insulin - pAKT2 - pGSK3β - glycogen 274 synthase gain - of - function . 275 276 Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) , like T2D , is associated with insulin resistance 43 . 277 NASH is an advanced form of nonalcoholic liver disease defined by three histological features : 278 hepatic steatosis , hepatic lobular inflammation , hepatocyte damage ( ballooning ) and can be 279 present with or without fibrosis . NAFLD and T2D likely share at least some pathophysiologic 280 mechanisms because more than one - third of patients ( 37 % ) with T2D have NASH 44 and almost 281 one - half of patients with NASH ( 44 % ) have T2D 45 . To evaluate the effect of SN - 401 on the 282 genesis of NAFLD , mice were raised on HFD for 16 weeks followed by intermittent dosing with 283 SN - 401 over the course of 5 weeks ( Fig . 4e ) . These mice had grossly smaller livers ( Fig . 4f ) , 284 lower hepatic triglyceride concentrations ( Fig . 4g ) and experienced a mild 14 % reduction in 285 body weight compared to vehicle - treated mice ( Fig . 4f ) . Histologic evaluation revealed 286 significant reductions in hepatic steatosis and hepatocyte damage compared to vehicle - treated 287 mice ( Fig . 4h & i , Supplemental Fig . S4 ) . The NAFLD activity score ( NAS ) , which integrates 288 histologic scoring of hepatic steatosis , lobular inflammation , and hepatocyte ballooning 46 ( Fig . 289 4i ) , also improved > 2 points in SN - 401 - treated mice compared to vehicle - treated mice . These 290 SN - 401 mediated reductions in hepatic steatosis and hepatocyte damage are consistent with 291 the observed increases in hepatic insulin sensitivity and consequent reductions in hepatic 292 glucose production via gluconeogenesis available for hepatic de novo lipogenesis , as observed 293 with other insulin sensitizers , such as metformin and TZDs 47 . Taken together , these data reveal 294 that SN - 401 augments SWELL1 protein and SWELL1 - mediated signaling to concomitantly 295 enhance both systemic insulin sensitivity and pancreatic β - cell insulin secretion , thereby 296 normalizing glycemic control in T2D mouse models . This improved metabolic state can reduce 297 ectopic lipid deposition , hepatocyte damage , and NAFLD that is associated with obesity and 298 T2D . 299 300 Chemical synthesis , molecular docking and cryo - EM reveal specific SN - 401 - SWELL1 301 interactions required for on - target activity 302 To confirm that SN - 401 - induced increases in SWELL1 protein and signaling are mediated by 303 direct binding to the SWELL1 - LRRC8 channel complex , as opposed to off - target effects , we 304 designed and synthesized novel SN - 401 congeners ( Fig . 5a ) with subtle structural changes that 305 either enhanced ( SN - 403 , SN - 406 , SN - 407 ) , or entirely eliminated ( Inactive1 , Inactive2 ) SN - 401 306 inhibition of I Cl , SWELL ( Fig . 5b & c ; Supplementary Fig . S5a - c ) . The cryo - EM structure of SN - 307 401 / DCPIB bound within the SWELL1 homo - hexamer revealed that SN - 401 binds at a 308 constriction point in the pore wherein the electronegative SN - 401 carboxylate group interacts 309 electrostatically with the R103 residue in one or more of the SWELL1 monomers 30 . Moreover , 310 SN - 401 appeared to stabilize the pore region of the SWELL1 hexamer in lipid - nanodiscs 30 . To 311 characterize the structural features of SN - 401 responsible for binding to SWELL1 - LRRC8 , we 312 performed molecular docking simulations of SN - 401 and its analogs into the SWELL1 homo - 313 hexamer ( PDB : 6NZZ ) , and identified two molecular determinants predicted to be critical for SN - 314 401 - SWELL1 - LRRC8 binding ( Fig . 5d ) : ( 1 ) the length of the carbon chain leading to the anionic 315 carboxylate group predicted to electrostatically interact with one or more R103 guanidine groups 316 ( found in SWELL1 / LRRC8a and LRRC8b ; Fig . 5d - solid circles ) ; and ( 2 ) proper orientation of 317 the hydrophobic cyclopentyl group that slides into a hydrophobic cleft at the interface of LRRC8 318 monomers ( conserved among all LRRC8 subunit interfaces ; Fig . 5d - broken circles ) . Docking 319 simulations predicted shortening the carbon chain leading to the carboxylate by 2 carbons 320 would yield a molecule , Inactive 1 , that could either interact with R103 through the carboxylate 321 group ( Supplementary Fig . S5d ( i ) ) , or have the cyclopentyl ring occupy the hydrophobic cleft 322 ( Supplementary Fig . S5d ( ii ) ) , but unable to simultaneously participate in both interactions 323 ( Supplementary Fig . S5d ) . Similarly , docking simulations predicted removing the butyl group of 324 SN - 401 would yield a molecule , Inactive 2 , unable to orient the cyclopentyl group into a position 325 favorable for interaction with the hydrophobic cleft without introducing structural strain in the 326 molecule ( Supplementary Fig . S5e , black arrow ) . Both of these structural modifications , 327 predicted to abrogate either carboxylate - R103 electrostatic binding ( Inactive 1 ) or cyclopentyl - 328 hydrophobic pocket binding ( Inactive 2 ) were sufficient to eliminate I Cl , SWELL inhibitory activity in 329 vitro ( Fig . 5b & c ) . Conversely , lengthening the carbon chain attached to the carboxylate group of 330 SN - 401 by 1 - 3 carbons ( SN - 403 ; 1 carbon , SN - 406 : 2 carbons , and SN407 : 3 carbons ) was 331 predicted to enhance the R103 electrostatic interactions ( Fig . 5e ; Supplementary Fig . S5f & g , 332 black solid circle ) , and better orient the cyclopentyl group to bind within the hydrophobic cleft 333 ( Fig . 5e , Supplementary Fig . S5f & g , broken circle ) . Additional binding interactions for SN - 334 403 , SN - 406 and SN - 407 are also predicted along the channel , due to the longer carbon chains 335 affording additional hydrophobic interactions with side chain carbons of the R103 residues ( Fig . 336 5e ; Supplementary Fig . S5f & g , purple dashes ) . As anticipated , SN - 403 , SN - 406 , and SN - 407 337 had increased I Cl , SWELL inhibitory activity as compared to SN - 401 ( Fig . 5b & c ; Supplementary 338 Fig . S5a - c ) . 339 340 To test the predictions of our molecular docking simulations , we used cryo - EM to determine the 341 structure of the SWELL1 homohexamer in lipid nanodiscs in the presence of SN - 407 ( Fig . 5f , 342 Supplementary Figs . S6 - 8 ) . In initial maps using six - fold symmetry , SN - 407 density was less 343 apparent than for DCPIB / SN - 401 30 , potentially due to a reduction in SN - 407 occupancy that is a 344 consequence of lower compound solubility or the presence of multiple drug poses in different 345 particles ( Supplementary Fig . S7 ) . Therefore , we utilized six - fold symmetry expansion and 346 symmetry relaxation 48 and were able to resolve two distinct poses for SN - 407 with similar 347 occupancy . Pose - 1 shows the drug oriented vertically in the channel’s selectivity filter in a 348 manner that is similar to that observed for DCPIB / SN - 401 , but with the lengthened carboxylate 349 chain coiling to maintain its interaction with R103 ( Fig . 5f ( i ) ) . In Pose - 2 , SN - 407 is tilted off the 350 SWELL1 central axis , positioning its cyclopentyl group closer to the hydrophobic cleft between 351 SWELL1 subunits ( Fig . 5f ( ii ) ) . These data confirm lengthening the carboxylate chain in SN - 407 352 preserves electrostatic interactions with R103 and enables additional contacts between the 353 carboxylate chain and upper hydrophobic moieties in distinct binding poses , consistent with the 354 results of our docking simulations . Collectively , these molecular docking , cryo - EM and functional 355 experiments indicate that SN - 401 and SWELL1 - active congeners ( SN - 403 / 406 / 407 ) bind to 356 SWELL1 - LRRC8 hexamers at both R103 ( via carboxylate end ) and at the interface between 357 adjacent LRRC8 monomers ( via hydrophobic end ) , to potentially stabilize the closed state of the 358 channel , and thereby inhibit I Cl , SWELL activity . Indeed , SN - 401 / SN - 407 cryo - EM data , and 359 molecular docking simulations likely reflects the closed state of the SWELL1 homomer . This 360 raises the possibility that SN - 401 and active SN - 40X compounds bind with higher affinity to 361 SWELL1 - LRRC8 complexes in the closed state most commonly encountered under native , 362 physiological conditions , as compared to the open state . Moreover , we hypothesize these SN - 363 40X compounds may function as molecular tethers to stabilize assembly of the SWELL1 - 364 LRRC8 hexamer by binding between R103 and adjacent LRRC8 monomers , potentially 365 reducing SWELL1 - LRRC8 complex disassembly , subsequent proteasomal degradation , and 366 thereby augment translocation from ER to plasma membrane signaling domains , akin to 367 pharmacological chaperones 49 , 50 , 51 , 52 , 53 368 369 SN - 401 and SWELL1 - active congener SN - 406 inhibit I Cl , SWELL and promote SWELL1 370 dependent signaling at sub - micromolar concentrations 371 To test this hypothesis , we compared the potency of SN - 401 / SN - 406 to block I Cl , SWELL when 372 applied to closed as compared to open SWELL1 - LRRC8 channels . SN - 401 / SN - 406 373 concentrations of 7 - 10 µ M are required to effectively block channels when first opened by 374 hypotonic activation ( Fig . 5b & c ) 31 . In contrast , application of 1 µ M of SN - 401 or SN - 406 to 375 SWELL1 - LRRC8 channels in the closed state ( i . e . for 30 min prior to hypotonic activation ) 376 markedly suppressed and delayed subsequent hypotonic activation of I Cl , SWELL , compared to 377 either vehicle alone , or Inactive compounds ( Fig . 6a & b ) . SN - 401 and SN - 406 at concentrations 378 as low as 250 nM had a similar effect ( Fig . 6c & d ) . These data support the notion that SN - 40X 379 compounds bind with higher affinity to SWELL1 - LRRC8 channels in the closed / resting state 380 than the open / activated state , and stabilize the closed conformation at less than one - tenth the 381 concentration required to inhibit activated SWELL1 - LRRC8 channels . 382 383 Next , we applied SWELL1 - active ( SN - 401 , SN - 406 ) , and Inactive ( Inactive1 , Inactive 2 ) 384 compounds to differentiated 3T3 - F442A adipocytes under basal culture conditions for 4 days 385 and then measured SWELL1 protein after 6 h of serum starving . At both 10 and 1 µ M , SN - 401 386 and SN - 406 markedly augment SWELL1 protein to levels 1 . 5 - 2 . 1 - fold greater than vehicle - 387 treated controls , while SWELL1 - inactive congeners Inactive 1 and Inactive 2 do not significantly 388 increase SWELL1 protein levels ( Fig . 6e - h ) . SN - 401 and SN - 406 also enhanced plasma 389 membrane ( PM ) localization of endogenous SWELL1 in preadipocytes compared to vehicle - or 390 Inactive1 ( Fig . 6i & j ; Supplementary Fig . S9a ) , consistent with increased endoplasmic 391 reticulum ( ER ) to plasma membrane trafficking of SWELL1 . Notably , SN - 401 and SN - 406 are 392 capable of augmenting both SWELL1 protein and trafficking at concentrations as low as 1 µ M 393 ( Fig . 6g - j ; Supplementary Fig . S9a ) , or an order of magnitude below the ~ 10 µ M concentration 394 required for inhibiting activated SWELL1 - LRRC8 ( upon hypotonic stimulation ) . These findings 395 are consistent with the results of SN - 401 / SN - 406 I Cl , SWELL inhibition when pre - applied to closed 396 SWELL1 - LRRC8 channels ( Fig . 6a - d ) and also with our observations that 500 nM SN - 401 is 397 sufficient to augment SWELL1 dependent insulin - AKT2 - AS160 signaling in 3T3 - F442A 398 adipocytes ( Fig . 2i & j ) . Similarly , SN - 401 applied at 500 nM to human umbilical vein endothelial 399 cells ( HUVECs ) increases eNOS phosphorylation , a downstream AKT target , and this effect is 400 abrogated by small interfering / short hairpin mediated SWELL1 knockdown in HUVECs , 401 supporting a SWELL1 dependent mechanism ( Supplementary Fig . S9b - d ) . Furthermore , SN - 402 406 applied to HUVECs at 100 nM is sufficient to induce SWELL1 1 . 5 - fold , basal pAKT2 2 . 8 - 403 fold , and downstream p - eNOS 5 . 5 - fold as compared to vehicle ( Fig . 6k & l ) , while Inactive 1 has 404 no effect at 500 nM ( Fig . 6m & n ) . Indeed , SN - 401 exhibits dose - dependent induction p - eNOS in 405 HUVECs with an EC 50 of 21 nM ( Fig . 6o & p ) . 406 407 SWELL1 - active compounds prevent reductions in SWELL1 protein and rescue SWELL1 408 dependent islet insulin secretion under glucolipotoxic conditions 409 We next asked whether endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) stress associated with glucolipotoxicity in 410 metabolic syndrome may promote SWELL1 protein degradation , and thereby reduce I Cl , SWELL 411 and SWELL1 protein in T2D ( Fig . 1 ) . In this context , we hypothesized that SN - 401 and SN - 406 412 might assist with SWELL1 - LRRC8 assembly and rescue SWELL1 - LRRC8 from degradation . To 413 test this concept in vitro , we first treated 3T3 - F442A adipocytes with either vehicle , SN - 401 , SN - 414 406 or Inactive 2 , and then subjected these cells to 1 mM palmitate + 25 mM glucose to induce 415 to glucolipotoxic stress ( Fig . 7a & b ) . We found that SWELL1 protein was reduced by 50 % upon 416 palmitate / glucose treatment , consistent with ER stress - mediated SWELL1 degradation , and this 417 reduction was entirely prevented by both SWELL1 - active SN - 401 and SN - 406 , but not by 418 SWELL1 - inactive 2 ( Fig . 7a & b ) . These data are consistent with the notion that SN - 401 and 419 SWELL1 - active congeners are functioning to stabilize SWELL1 - LRRC8 assembly and signaling 420 under glucolipotoxic conditions associated with T2D and metabolic syndrome . 421 422 To examine whether these protective effects of SN - 401 under glucolipotoxic conditions is also 423 capable of rescuing islet insulin secretion , and whether this effect occurs via target engagement , 424 we measured dynamic glucose - stimulated insulin secretion ( GSIS ) by perifusion in human and 425 murine islets + / - palmitate + / - SN - 401 and + / - SWELL1 as outlined in Fig . 7c . In both human 426 and murine islets , we found that 16 hours of 1mM palmitate treatment reduces GSIS compared 427 to baseline ( Fig . 7d - g , Supplementary Table . S2 ) . However , when islets are treated with SN - 428 401 ( 10 µM ) for 4 days prior to palmitate treatment , then maintained during palmitate treatment , 429 and subsequently SN - 401 / palmitate washed off during GSIS , insulin secretion is normalized 430 ( Fig . 7d - g , Supplementary Table . S2 ) . Importantly , this SN - 401 mediated GSIS normalization 431 under glucolipotoxic conditions is SWELL1 dependent , since this rescue is completely 432 abrogated in SWELL1 KD human islets ( Fig . 7d & e , Supplementary Table . S2 ) and β - cell 433 targeted SWELL1 KO murine islets ( Fig . 7f & g ) . 434 435 SWELL1 - active SN - 401 congeners improve glycemic control in murine T2D 436 To determine if the effects of SN - 401 observed in vivo in T2D mice are attributable to SWELL1 - 437 LRRC8 binding , as opposed to off - target effects , we next measured fasting blood glucose and 438 glucose tolerance in HFD T2D mice treated with either SWELL1 - active SN - 403 or SN - 406 as 439 compared to SWELL1 - inactive Inactive 1 ( all at 5 mg / kg / day x 4 days ) . In mice treated with HFD 440 for 8 weeks , SN - 403 significantly reduced fasting blood glucose and improved glucose tolerance 441 compared to Inactive 1 ( Fig . 8a ) . In cohorts of mice raised on HFD for 12 - 18 weeks , with more 442 severe obesity - induced T2D , SN - 406 also markedly reduced fasting blood glucose and 443 improved glucose tolerance ( Fig . 8b ) . Similarly , in a separate experiment , SN - 406 significantly 444 improved glucose tolerance in HFD T2D mice , compared to Inactive 1 ( Fig . 8c ) , and this is 445 associated with a trend toward improved insulin sensitivity based on the Homeostatic Model 446 Assessment of Insulin Resistance ( HOMA - IR ) 54 ( Fig . 8d ) , and significantly augmented insulin 447 secretion in perifusion GSIS ( Fig . 8e ) . Finally , based on the GTT AUC , SN - 407 also improved 448 glucose tolerance in T2D KKA y mice , compared to Inactive 1 ( Fig . 8f ) and increased GSIS ( Fig . 449 8g ) . These data reveal the in vivo anti - hyperglycemic action of SN - 401 and its bioactive 450 congeners require SWELL1 - LRRC8 binding and thus supports the notion of SWELL1 on - target 451 activity in vivo . 452 453 An important feature of the hypothesized mechanism of action of SN - 40X is that these active 454 compounds bind to SWELL1 - LRRC8 channel complexes in vivo in the ~ 100 - 500 nM range to 455 augment SWELL1 - dependent signaling ( Fig 2i & j ; Fig . 6k - p ; Supplementary Fig . S9b - d ) 456 without achieving the serum concentrations necessary for open channel SWELL1 current 457 inhibition ( ~ 5 - 10 uM ) 31 , followed by unbinding . As such , SWELL1 function may be rescued 458 without significant SWELL1 - LRRC8 or VRAC inhibition . Consistent with this hypothesis , in vivo 459 pharmacokinetics ( PK ) of SN - 401 and SN - 406 in mice following i . p . or p . o . administration of 5 460 mg / kg of SN - 401 or SN - 406 reveal plasma concentrations that either transiently approach 461 ( Supplementary Fig . S10a , i . p . dosing ) , or remain well below I Cl , SWELL inhibitory concentrations 462 ( Supplementary Fig . S10b , p . o . dosing ) while exceeding concentrations sufficient for induction 463 of SWELL1 signaling activity ( > ~ 100 nM ) for 8 - 12 hours . Importantly , SN - 401 PK in a target 464 tissue , adipose , also closely tracks serum concentrations via both i . p . and p . o . administration 465 ( Supplementary Fig . S10c ) . Finally , these in vivo PK studies demonstrate that SN - 401 has 466 high oral bioavailability ( AUC p . o . / AUC i . v . = 79 % , Supplementary Table S7 ) , and when 467 administered via oral gavage to HFD - fed T2D C57 mice at 5 mg / kg / day SN - 401 fully retains in 468 vivo therapeutic efficacy ( Supplementary Fig . S10d ) . Collectively , these PK data reveal that 469 appropriate SN - 401 concentrations are attained to achieve the observed therapeutic effect , 470 while remaining insufficient to inhibit activated VRAC . 471 472 Discussion 473 Our current working model is that the transition from compensated obesity ( pre - diabetes , 474 normoglycemia ) to decompensated obesity ( T2D , hyperglycemia ) reflects , among other things , 475 a relative reduction in SWELL1 protein expression and signaling in peripheral insulin - sensitive 476 tissues 29 , 32 and in pancreatic β - cells 55 , 56 – metabolically phenocopying SWELL1 - loss - of - function 477 models 24 , 27 - 29 . This contributes to the combined insulin resistance and impaired insulin - secretion 478 associated with poorly - controlled T2D and hyperglycemia . SWELL1 forms a macromolecular 479 signaling complex that includes heterohexamers of SWELL1 and LRRC8b - e 22 , 23 , with 480 stoichiometries that likely vary from tissue to tissue . We propose SWELL1 - LRRC8 signaling 481 complexes are inherently unstable , and thus a proportion of complexes succumb to disassembly 482 and degradation . Glucolipotoxicity and ensuing ER stress associated with T2D states 57 - 59 483 provide an unfavorable environment for SWELL1 - LRRC8 complex assembly , contributing to 484 SWELL1 degradation and reductions in SWELL1 protein and SWELL1 - mediated I Cl , SWELL 485 observed in T2D . We speculate that small molecules SN - 401 and active congeners ( SN - 40X ) 486 serve as pharmacological chaperones 49 to stabilize formation of the SWELL1 - LRRC8 complex . 487 This reduces SWELL1 degradation , and enhances the passage of SWELL1 - LRRC8 heteromers 488 through the ER and Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane – thereby rectifying the SWELL1 - 489 deficient state in multiple metabolically important tissues in the setting of metabolic syndrome to 490 improve glycemic control via both insulin sensitization 24 , 25 , 29 and secretion 27 , 28 mechanisms . 491 Indeed , the concept of small molecule inhibitors acting as therapeutic molecular chaperones 49 to 492 support the folding , assembly and trafficking of proteins ( including ion channels ) has been 493 demonstrated for Niemann - Pick C disease 50 , 51 and congenital hyperinsulinism ( SUR1 - K ATP 494 channel mutants ) 60 - 62 . Similarly , in the case of congenital hyperinsulinism , the SUR1 - K ATP 495 chemical chaperones are also themselves , paradoxically , K ATP channel inhibitors 60 - 62 . Also , this 496 therapeutic mechanism is analogous to small molecule correctors for another chloride channel , 497 CFTR ( VX - 659 / VX - 445 , Vertex Pharmaceuticals ) 52 , 53 , which is proving to be a breakthrough 498 therapeutic approach 63 , 64 for cystic fibrosis . In vivo , we hypothesize SN - 40X compounds bind to 499 SWELL1 - LRRC8 complexes in the closed state , within the concentration range between C max 500 and ~ 100 nM . This shifts the balance toward maintaining stable SWELL1 - LRRC8 complexes to 501 preserve normal levels and localization ( trafficking ) within the T2D glucolipotoxic milieu . SN - 40X 502 may then unbind from the SWELL1 - LRRC8 complex , thereby restoring insulin signaling in target 503 tissues , and permitting SWELL1 - mediated β - cell insulin secretion . This seemingly paradoxical 504 mechanism may rely on the phasic SN - 40X concentrations observed in vivo ( see in vivo PK 505 data ) to allow for SN - 401 binding , resultant chaperone - mediated rescue , followed by unbinding ; 506 as opposed to tonic SN - 40X - SWELL1 binding . Another prediction of this model is that lower - 507 affinity SN - 40X compounds may be preferable to very high - affinity congeners , to provide the 508 appropriate pharmacodynamics required for unbinding , and optimal therapeutic efficacy . Indeed , 509 this mechanism is reminiscent of the paradoxical use of insulin secretagogue sulfonylurea 510 receptor inhibitors as pharmacological chaperones to rescue KATP mutants in congenital 511 hyperinsulinism by binding ( and inhibiting ) these mutant KATP channels 60 - 62 , and then 512 unbinding , thereby favoring lower affinity inhibitors : tolbutamide and carbamazepine , over 513 glibenclamide . 514 515 Through structure activity relationship ( SAR ) , in silico molecular docking studies and cryo - EM 516 studies , we identified hotspots on opposing ends of the SN - 401 molecule that interact with 517 separate regions of the SWELL1 - LRRC8 complex : the carboxylate group with R103 in multiple 518 LRRC8 subunits at a constriction in the pore , and the cyclopentyl group within the hydrophobic 519 cleft formed by adjacent LRRC8 monomers ; functioning like a molecular staple or tether to bind 520 loosely associated SWELL1 - LRRC8 monomers ( especially in the setting of T2D ) into a more 521 stable hexameric structure . Indeed , the cryo - EM structure obtained in lipid nanodiscs of SN - 522 401 30 and novel derivative SN - 407 supports hypothesized binding models of SN - 40X with 523 SWELL1 homomer . 524 Another advantage provided by SAR studies was identification and synthesis of SN - 401 525 congeners that removed ( Inactive 1 and 2 ) or enhanced ( SN - 403 / 406 / 407 ) SWELL1 - binding , as 526 these provided powerful tools to query SWELL1 - on target activity directly in vitro and in vivo , 527 and also validated the proof - of - concept for developing novel SN - 401 congeners with enhanced 528 efficacy . Indeed , this approach was necessary to prove SWELL1 - LRRC8 on - target activity of 529 the SN - 40X series in vivo , because SWELL1 - LRRC8 is expressed broadly in numerous insulin - 530 sensitive tissues and in islet cells . As the global SWELL1 / LRRC8a KO mouse is essentially 531 embryonically lethal 20 testing SN - 40X compounds in global SWELL1 - / - mice is not possible , and 532 generating multi - tissue ( adipose , liver , skeletal muscle , β - cell ) SWELL1 KO mice is outside the 533 scope of the current study . Therefore , using the SAR to generate SWELL1 - LRRC8 inactive 534 compounds ( Inactive 1 and 2 ) as a negative control provided an alternative approach to prove in 535 vivo on - target activity on a broadly expressed signaling molecule . In addition to this medicinal 536 chemistry approach employed both in vitro and in vivo to test on target activity , we found that 537 SN - 40X mediated induction of AKT - AS160 and AKT - eNOS signaling requires SWELL1 in 538 cultured adipocytes and HUVECs , respectively . Moreover , SN - 401 mediated rescue of islet 539 insulin secretion under gluco - lipotoxic conditions in vitro also requires SWELL1 . Finally , it is 540 important to note that the studies demonstrating promiscuity of SN - 401 / DCPIB with other ion 541 channel targets all applied DCPIB at ~ 10 - 200 µM 65 - 70 . This is 100 - 200 - fold higher than the 542 concentrations required to potentiate SWELL1 - dependent signaling in vitro ( Fig . 2i & j ; Fig . 6k - p ; 543 Supplementary Fig . S9b - d ) , and similarly higher than SN - 401 and SN - 406 concentrations 544 predominantly attained in vivo ( Supplementary Fig . S10a - c ) to achieve a therapeutic effect 545 ( Fig . 3 & 8 ) . Accordingly , these studies are not applicable with respect to putative off - target 546 mechanisms for the therapeutic effects observed from SN - 40X compounds . 547 548 SWELL1 - LRRC8 complexes are broadly expressed in multiple tissues , and consist of unknown 549 combinations of SWELL1 , LRRC8b , LRRC8c , LRRC8d and LRRC8e , indicating SWELL1 550 complexes may be enormously heterogenous . However , SWELL1 - LRRC8 stabilizers like SN - 551 401 may be designed to target many , if not all , possible channel complexes since all will contain 552 the elements necessary for SN - 401 binding : at least one R103 ( from the requisite SWELL1 553 monomer : carboxyl group binding site ) , and the nature of the hydrophobic cleft ( cyclopentyl 554 binding site ) , which is conserved among all LRRC8 monomers . Indeed , traced glucose clamps 555 did reveal insulin sensitization effects in multiple tissues , including adipose , skeletal muscle , 556 liver and heart . The increased glucose - uptake in heart is particularly interesting , since this may 557 provide salutary effects on cardiac energetics that could favorably impact both systolic ( HFrEF ) 558 and diastolic ( HFpEF ) function in diabetic cardiomyopathy , and thereby potentially improve 559 cardiac outcomes in T2D , as observed with SGLT2 inhibitors 71 - 76 . 560 561 The current study provides an initial proof - of - concept for pharmacological induction of SWELL1 562 signaling using SWELL1 modulators ( SN - 40X ) to treat metabolic diseases at multiple 563 homeostatic nodes , including adipose , skeletal muscle , liver , and pancreatic β - cell , whereby 564 SN - 40X compounds function to restore both insulin - sensitivity and insulin secretion . Hence , SN - 565 401 may represent a tool compound from which a novel drug class may be derived to treat T2D , 566 NASH , and other metabolic diseases . 567 568 569 570 571 Methods 572 573 574 Patients 575 Human islets ( Integrated Islet Distribution Program , Prodo Laboratories and Alberta Diabetes 576 Institute Islet Core ) and adipocytes were obtained and cultured as described previously 24 , 27 . The 577 patients involved in the study were anonymous and information such as gender , age , HbA1c , 578 glucose levels and BMI only were available to the research team . The study was approved and 579 carried out as per the guidelines of the University of Iowa and Washington University Institutional 580 Review Board ( IRB ) . 581 582 Animals 583 All experimental procedures involving mice were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and 584 Use Committee of the University of Iowa and Washington University at St . Louis . All C57BL / 6 585 mice involved in this study were purchased from Charles River Labs . Both KK . Cg - Ay / J ( KKA y ) 586 and KK . Cg - Aa / J ( KKA a ) mice involved in study were gender and age - matched mice obtained from 587 Jackson Labs ( Stock No : 002468 ) and bred up for experiments . The mice were fed ad libitum with 588 either regular chow ( RC ) or high - fat diet ( Research Diets , Inc . , 60 kcal % fat ) with free access to 589 water and housed in a light - , temperature - and humidity - controlled room . For high - fat diet ( HFD ) 590 studies , only male mice were used and were started on HFD regimen at the age of 6 - 9 weeks . 591 For all experiments involving KKA y and KKA a mice , both males and females were used at 592 approximately 50 / 50 ratio . In all experiments involving mice , investigators were kept blinded both 593 during the experiments and subsequent analysis . 594 595 Small molecule treatment 596 All compounds were dissolved in Kolliphor® EL ( Sigma , # C5135 ) . Either vehicle ( Kolliphor® EL ) , 597 SN - 401 ( DCPIB , 5 mg / kg of body weight / day , Tocris , D1540 ) , SN - 403 , SN - 406 , SN - 407 or 598 Inactive 1 were administered i . p . as indicated using 1cc syringe / 26G X 1 / 2 inch needle daily for 599 4 - 10 days , and in one experiment , SN - 401 was administered daily for 8 weeks . SN - 401 , 600 formulated as above , was also administered by oral gavage at 5 mg / kg / day for 5 days using a 601 20G x 1 . 5 inch reusable metal gavage needle . 602 603 Adenovirus 604 Human adenoviruses type 5 with hLRRC8A / SWELL1 - shRNA ( Ad5 - mCherry - U6 - 605 hLRRC8A / SWELL1 - shRNA , 2 . 2 X 10 10 PFU / ml ) , a scrambled non - targeting control ( Ad5 - U6 - 606 scramble - mCherry , 1 X 10 10 PFU / ml ) , Ad5 - CAG - LoxP - stop - LoxP - 3XFlag - SWELL1 ( 1X 10 10 607 PFU / ml ) , β - cell - targeted adenovirus type 5 with Ad5 - RIP2 - GFP ( 4 . 1 X 10 10 PFU / ml ) , GCaMP6s 608 ( Ad5 - RIP1 - GCaMP6s , 4 . 9 X 10 10 PFU / ml ) , and GCaMP6s - 2A - iCre ( Ad5 - GCaMP6s - RFP - 2A - Cre , 609 5 . 8 X 10 10 PFU / ml ) were obtained from Vector Biolabs . Adenovirus type 5 with Ad5 - CMV - Cre - 610 eGFP ( 8 X 10 10 PFU / ml ) and Ad5 - CMV - Cre - mCherry ( 3 X 10 10 PFU / ml ) were obtained from the 611 University of Iowa Viral Vector Core . 612 613 Cell culture 614 Wildtype ( WT ) and SWELL1 knockout ( KO ) 3T3 - F442A ( Sigma - Aldrich ) cells were cultured and 615 differentiated as described previously 24 . Preadipocytes were maintained in 90 % DMEM ( 25 mM 616 D - Glucose and 4 mM L - Glutamine ) containing 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) and 100 IU penicillin 617 and 100 µg / ml streptomycin on collagen - coated ( rat tail type - I collagen , Corning ) plates at 37°C 618 and 5 % CO 2 . Upon reaching confluency , the cells were differentiated in the above - mentioned 619 media supplemented with 5 µg / ml insulin ( Cell Applications ) and replenished every other day with 620 the differentiation media . For insulin signaling studies on WT and KO adipocytes with or without 621 SWELL1 overexpression ( O / E ) , the cells were differentiated for 10 days and transduced with Ad5 - 622 CAG - LoxP - stop - LoxP - SWELL1 - 3XFlag virus ( MOI 12 ) on day 11 in 2 % FBS containing 623 differentiation medium . To induce the overexpression , Ad5 - CMV - Cre - eGFP ( or mcherry ) ( MOI 624 12 ) was added on day 13 in 2 % FBS containing differentiation medium . The cells were then 625 switched to 10 % FBS containing differentiation medium from day 15 to 17 .

The cell lysate was further sonicated in 10 sec cycle intervals for 2 - 3 times and 901 centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C and repeated one more time to remove the excess 902 fat . The supernatant was collected and further estimated for protein concentration using DC 903 protein assay kit ( Bio - Rad ) . Fat tissues were homogenized and suspended in RIPA buffer with 904 inhibitors and further processed in similar fashion as described above . HUVECs were also 905 prepared in a similarly except the lysates were spun only once to remove the cells debris and 906 obtain the clear supernatant . Human islets were washed twice with phosphate buffer saline ( PBS ) 907 and lysed using RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors . The lysate was 908 further clariﬁed by freezing in liquid nitrogen for about 10 s for three cycles . The supernatant was 909 collected from the whole lysate centrifuged at 12 , 000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C . Protein samples 910 were further prepared by boiling in 4X laemmli buffer . Approximately 10 - 50 µg of total protein was 911 loaded in 4 - 15 % gradient gel ( Bio - Rad ) for separation and protein transfer was carried out onto 912 the PVDF membranes ( Bio - Rad ) . Membranes were blocked in 5 % BSA ( or 5 % milk for SWELL1 ) 913 in TBST buffer ( 0 . 2 M Tris , 1 . 37 M NaCl , 0 . 2 % Tween - 20 , pH 7 . 4 ) for 1 h and incubated with 914 appropriate primary antibodies ( 5 % BSA or milk ) overnight at 4°C . The membranes were further 915 washed in TBST buffer before adding secondary antibody ( Bio - Rad , Goat - anti - rabbit , # 170 - 6515 ) 916 in 1 % BSA ( or 1 % milk for SWELL1 ) in TBST buffer for 1 h at RT . The signals were developed by 917 chemiluminescence ( Pierce ) and visualized using a Chemidoc imaging system ( Biorad ) .

In the case of SWELL1 membrane trafficking , the 928 3T3 - F442A preadipocytes were incubated in the presence of vehicle ( or SN - 401 , SN - 406 and 929 Inactive 1 ) at either 1 or 10 µM for 48h and further processed . The cells were fixed in ice - cold 930 acetone for 15 min at - 20°C and then washed four times with 1X PBS and permeabilized with 931 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 in 1X PBS for 5 min at RT and subsequently blocked with 5 % normal goat 932 serum for 1 h at RT . Either anti - SWELL1 ( 1 : 400 ) or anti - Flag ( 1 : 1500 , Sigma # F3165 ) antibody 933 were added to the cells and incubated overnight at 4°C . The cells were then washed three times 934 ( 1X PBS ) prior and after addition of 1 : 1000 Alexa Fluor 488 / 568 secondary antibody ( anti - rabbit , 935 # A11034 or anti - mouse , # A11004 ) for 1 h at RT . Cells were counterstained with nuclear TO - PRO - 936 3 ( Life Technologies , # T3605 ) or DAPI ( Invitrogen , # D1306 ) staining ( 1 µM ) for 20 min followed 937 by three washes with 1X PBS . Coverslips were further mounted on slides with ProLong Diamond 938 anti - fading media . All images were captured using Zeiss LSM700 / LSM510 confocal microscope 939 with 63X objective ( NA 1 . 4 ) . SWELL1 membrane localization was quantified by stacking all the z - 940 images and converting it into a binary image where the cytoplasmic intensity per unit area was 941 subtracted from the total cell intensity per unit area using ImageJ software . 942 943 944 Metabolic phenotyping 945 Mice were fasted for 6 h prior to glucose tolerance tests ( GTT ) . Baseline glucose levels at 0 min 946 timepoint ( fasting glucose , FG ) were measured from blood sample collected from tail snipping 947 using glucometer ( Bayer Healthcare LLC ) . Either 1 g or 0 . 75 g D - Glucose / kg body weight were 948 injected ( i . p . ) for lean or HFD mice , respectively and glucose levels were measured at 7 , 15 , 30 , 949 60 , 90 and 120 min timepoints after injection . For insulin tolerance tests ( ITTs ) , the mice were 950 fasted for 4 h . Similar to GTTs , the baseline blood glucose levels were measured at 0 min 951 timepoint and 15 , 30 , 60 , 90 and 120 min timepoints post - injection ( i . p . ) of insulin ( HumulinR , 952 1U / kg body weight for lean mice or 1 . 25 U / kg body weight for HFD mice ) . GTTs or ITTs with 953 vehicle ( or SN - 401 , SN - 403 , SN - 406 , SN - 407 and Inactive 1 ) treated groups were performed 954 approximately 24 hours after the last injection . For measuring serum insulin levels , the vehicle ( or 955 SN - 401 , SN - 406 and Inactive 1 ) treated HFD mice were fasted for 6 h and injected ( i . p . ) with 0 . 75 956 g D - Glucose / kg body weight and blood samples collected at 0 , 7 , 15 and 30 min time points in 957 microvette capillary tubes ( SARSTEDT , # 16 . 444 ) and centrifuged at 2000Xg for 20 min at 4°C . 958 The collected plasma was then measured for insulin content by using Ultra - Sensitive Mouse 959 Insulin ELISA Kit ( Crystal Chem , # 90080 ) . All mouse studies were performed in a blinded fashion . 960 Body weights for all the mice are listed in Supplementary Table . S5 . 961 962 Murine islet isolation and perifusion assay 963 For patch - clamp studies involving primary mouse β - cells , mice were anesthesized by injecting 964 Avertin ( 0 . 0125 g / ml in H 2 O ) followed by cervical dislocation . HFD or polygenic KKAy mice treated 965 with either vehicle or SN - 401 , SN - 406 , SN - 407 and Inactive 1 were anesthesized with 1 - 4 % 966 isoflurane followed by cervical dislocation . Islets were further isolated as described previously 27 . 967 Human islets were cultured in RPMI media with 2 % FBS overnight . The next day either scramble 968 or shSWELL1 adenoviral transduction was carried out ( ﬁnal concentration of 5 × 10 ^ 7 PFU / ml ) 969 and the islets were incubated for 12 h . The islets were then washed with PBS three times and 970 cultured in RPMI medium with 10 % FBS for 4 – 5 days . For SN - 401 / Palmitate experiments , human 971 islets were either transduced with adenoviral short hairpin for control ( shScramble ) or SWELL1 972 knockdown ( shSWELL1 ) and murine islets isolated from floxed - SWELL1 mouse ( SWELL1 fl / fl ) 973 were either transduced with adenoviral control ( Ad - RIP1 - GCaMP6s ) or Cre - recombinase ( Ad - 974 RIP1 - GCaMP6s - 2A - Cre ) virus for 12 hours respectively in 2 % FBS containing RPMI media . The 975 islets were then washed in 1XPBS for three times and treated with either vehicle or SN - 401 ( 10 976 µM ) for 96 hours followed by treatment with 1 : 3 palmitate : BSA with or without SN - 401 in 10 % 977 FBS containing RPMI media for 16 h ( Fig . 7c ) . The GSIS perifusion assay for islets were 978 performed using a PERI4 - 02 from Biorep Technologies . For each experiment , around 50 freshly 979 isolated islets ( all from the same isolation batch ) were handpicked to match size of islets across 980 the samples and loaded into the polycarbonate perifusion chamber between two layers of 981 polyacrylamide - microbead slurry ( Bio - Gel P - 4 , BioRad ) by the same experienced operator . 982 Perifusion buffer contained ( in mM ) : 120 NaCl , 24 NaHCO 3 , 4 . 8 KCl , 2 . 5 CaCl 2 , 1 . 2 MgSO 4 , 10 983 HEPES , 2 . 8 glucose , 27 . 2 mannitol , 0 . 25 % w / v bovine serum albumin , pH 7 . 4 with NaOH ( 300 984 mOsm / kg ) . Perifusion buffer kept at 37°C was circulated at 120 μl / min . After 48 min of washing 985 with 2 . 8 mM glucose solution for stabilization , islets were stimulated with the following sequence : 986 16 min of 16 . 7 mM glucose , 40 min of 2 . 8 mM glucose , 10 min of 30 mM KCl , and 12 min of 2 . 8 987 mM glucose . Osmolarity was matched by adjusting mannitol concentration when preparing 988 solution containing 16 . 7 mM glucose . Serial samples were collected either every 1 or 2 min into 989 96 wells kept at 4°C . Insulin concentrations were further determined using commercially available 990 ELISA kit ( Mercodia ) . The area under the curve ( AUC ) for the high - glucose induced insulin 991 release was calculated for time points between 50 to 74 / 84 min . At the completion of the 992 experiments , islets were further lysed by addition of RIPA buffer and the amount of insulin was 993 detected by ELISA . 994 995 996 Drug pharmacokinetics 997 The pharmacokinetic studies for SN - 401 and SN - 406 were performed at Charles River Laboratory 998 as outlined below . Male C57 / BL6 mice were used in the study and assessed for a single dose ( 5 999 mg / kg ) administration . The compounds were prepared in Cremaphor for i . p . and p . o dose routes 1000 and in 5 % ethanol , 10 % Tween - 20 and water mix for i . v . route at a final concentration of 1 mg / mL . 1001 Terminal blood samples were collected via cardiac venipuncture under anesthesia at time points 1002 0 . 08 , 0 . 5 , 2 , 8 h post dose for i . v and at timepoints 0 . 25 , 2 , 8 , 24 h post dose for i . p . and p . o . 1003 groups respectively with a sample size of 3 mice per timepoint . The blood samples were collected 1004 in tubes with K2 EDTA anticoagulant and further processed to collect plasma by centrifugation at 1005 3500 rpm at 5 °C for 10 min . Samples were further processed in LC / MS to determine the 1006 concentration of the compounds . Non - compartmental analysis was performed to obtain the PK 1007 parameters using the PKPlus software package ( Simulation Plus ) . The area under the plasma 1008 concentration - time curve ( AUC inf ) is calculated from time 0 to infinity where the C max is the maximal 1009 concentration achieved in plasma and t 1 / 2 is the terminal elimination half - life . Oral bioavailability 1010 was calculated as AUC Oral / AUC IV * 100 . 1011 1012 Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamps 1013 Sterile silicone catheters ( Dow - Corning ) were placed into the jugular vein of mice under isoflurane 1014 anesthesia . Placed catheter was flushed with 200 U / mL heparin in saline and the free end of the 1015 catheter was directed subcutaneously via a blunted 14 - gauge sterile needle and connected to a 1016 small tubing device that exited through the back of the animal . Mice were allowed to recover from 1017 surgery for 3 days , then received IP injections of vehicle or SN - 401 ( 5 mg / kg ) for 4 days . 1018 Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps were performed on day 8 post - surgery on unrestrained , 1019 conscious mice as described elsewhere 79 , 80 , with some modifications . Mice were fasted for 6 h at 1020 which time insulin and glucose infusion were initiated ( time 0 ) . At 80 min prior to time 0 basal 1021 sampling was conducted , where whole - body glucose flux was traced by infusion of 0 . 05 μCi / min 1022 D - [ 3 - 3 H ] - glucose ( Perkin Elmer ) , after a priming 5 μCi bolus for 1 minute . After the basal period , 1023 starting at time 0 D - [ 3 - 3 H ] - glucose was continuously infused at the 0 . 2 μCi / min rate and the 1024 infusion of insulin ( Humulin , Eli Lilly ) was initiated with a bolus of 80 mU / kg / min ( 10 µl volume for 1025 1 min ) then followed by continuous infusion of insulin at the dose of 8 mU / kg / min throughout the 1026 assay . Fifty percent dextrose ( Hospira ) was infused at a variable rates ( GIR ) starting at the same 1027 time as the initiation of insulin infusion to maintain euglycemia at the targeted level of 150 mg / dL 1028 ( 8 . 3 mM ) . Blood glucose ( BG ) measurements were taken every ten minutes via tail vein sampling 1029 using Contour glucometer ( Bayer ) . After mouse reached stable BG and GIR ( typically , after 75 1030 minutes since starting the insulin infusion ; for some mice , a longer time was required to achieve 1031 steady state ) a single bolus of 12 μCi of [ 1 - 14 C ] - 2 - deoxy - D - glucose ( Perkin Elmer ) in 96 μl of 1032 saline was administered . Plasma samples ( collected from centrifuged blood ) for determination of 1033 tracers enrichment , glucose level and insulin concentration were obtained at times - 80 , - 20 , - 10 , 1034 0 , and every 10 min starting at 80 min post - insulin ( 5 min . after [ 1 - 14 C ] - 2 - deoxy - D - glucose bolus 1035 was administered ) until the conclusion of the assay at 140 min . Tissue samples were then 1036 collected from mice under isofluorane anesthesia from organs of interest ( e . g . , liver , heart , kidney , 1037 white adipose tissue , brown adipose tissue , gastrocnemius , soleus etc . ) for determination of 1 - 1038 14 C ] - 2 - deoxy - D - glucose tracer uptake . Plasma and tissue samples were processed as described 1039 previously 79 . Briefly , plasma samples were deproteinized with Ba ( OH ) 2 and ZnSO 4 and dried to 1040 eliminate tritiated water . The glucose turnover rate ( mg / kg - min ) was calculated as the rate of 1041 tracer infusion ( dpm / min ) divided by the corrected plasma glucose specific activity ( dpm / mg ) per 1042 kg body weight of the mouse . Fluctuations from steady state were accounted for by use of Steele ' s 1043 model . Plasma glucose was measured using Analox GMD9 system ( Analox Technologies ) . 1044 1045 Tissue samples ( ~ 30 mg each ) were homogenized in 750 µl of 0 . 5 % perchloric acid , neutralized 1046 with 10 M KOH and centrifuged . The supernatant was then used for first measuring the 1047 abundance of total [ 1 - 14 C ] signal ( derived from both 1 - 14 C - 2 - deoxy - D - glucose , 1 - 14 C - 2 - deoxy - D - 1048 glucose 6 phosphate ) and , following a precipitation step with 0 . 3 N Ba ( OH ) 3 and 0 . 3 N ZnSO 4 , for 1049 the measuring of non - phosphorylated 1 - 14 C - 2 - deoxy - D - glucose . Glycogen was isolated by 1050 ethanol precipitation from 30 % KOH tissue lysates , as described 81 . Insulin level in plasma at T0 1051 and T140 were measured using a Stellux ELISA rodent insulin kit ( Alpco ) . 1052 1053 Protein purification and nanodisc formation 1054 SWELL1 was purified as described previously 30 . Freshly purified SWELL1 from gel filtration in 1055 Buffer 1 ( 20 mM HEPES , 150 mM KCl , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 025 % DDM , pH 7 . 4 ) was reconstituted into 1056 MSP1E3D1 with a lipid mix ( 2 : 1 : 1 weight ratio of DOPE : POPC : POPS lipids ( Avanti , Alabaster , 1057 Alabama ) ) at a final molar ratio of 1 : 2 . 5 : 200 ( Monomer Ratio : SWELL1 , MSP1E3D1 , Lipid Mix ) . 1058 First , solubilized lipid in Column Buffer ( 20 mM HEPES , 150 mM KCl , 1 mM EDTA pH 7 . 4 ) was 1059 mixed with additional DDM detergent , Column Buffer , and SWELL1 . This solution was mixed at 1060 4°C for 30 min before addition of purified MSP1E3D1 . This addition brought the final 1061 concentrations to approximately 10 µM SWELL1 , 25 µM MSP1E3D1 , 2 mM lipid mix , and 3 . 3 mM 1062 DDM in Column Buffer ( 1 mL reaction ) . The solution with MSP1E3D1 was mixed at 4°C for 10 1063 min before addition of 130 mg of Biobeads SM2 ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) . Biobeads ( washed into 1064 methanol , water , and then Column Buffer ) were weighed with liquid removed by P1000 tip ( Damp 1065 weight ) . This mix was incubated at 4°C for 30 min before addition of another 130 mg of Biobeads 1066 ( final 260 mg of Biobeads per mL ) . This final mixture was then mixed at 4°C overnight ( ~ 14 hr ) . 1067 Supernatant was cleared of beads by letting large beads settle and carefully removing 1068 supernatant with a pipet . Sample was spun for 5 min at 21 , 000 x g before loading onto a Superose 1069 6 column in Column Buffer without EDTA . Peak fractions corresponding to SWELL1 in 1070 MSP1E3D1 were collected , 100 kDa cutoff spin concentrated , and then re - run on the Superose 1071 6 . The fractions corresponding to the center of the peak were then pooled and concentrated prior 1072 to grid preparation . 1073 1074 Grid preparation 1075 SN - 407 in DMSO ( Stock 10 mM ) was added to SWELL1 - Msp1E3D1 sample to give a final 1076 concentration of 1 mg / mL SWELL1 - MSP1E3D1 and 100 µM SN - 407 . The drug was allowed to 1077 equilibrate and bind complex on ice for ~ 1 hour prior to freezing grids . Sample with drug was 1078 cleared by a 5 min 21 , 000 x g spin prior to grid making . For freezing grids , a 2 µl drop of protein 1079 was applied to freshly glow discharged Holey Carbon , 300 mesh R 1 . 2 / 1 . 3 gold grids ( Quantifoil , 1080 Großlöbichau , Germany ) . A Vitrobot Mark IV ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) was 1081 utilized with 22°C , 100 % humidity , one blot force , and a 3 s blot time , before plunge freezing in 1082 liquid ethane . Grids were then clipped in autoloader cartridges for collection . 1083 1084 Data collection 1085 SWELL1 - MSP1E3D1 with SN - 407 grids were transferred to a Talos Arctica cryo - electron 1086 microscope ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) operated at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV . Images 1087 were recorded in an automated fashion with SerialEM 82 using image shift with a target defocus 1088 range of −0 . 7 ~ −2 . 2 µm over 5 . 493 s as 50 subframes with a K3 direct electron detector ( Gatan , 1089 Pleasanton , CA ) in super - resolution mode with a super - resolution pixel size of 0 . 5685 Å 83 . The 1090 electron dose was 9 . 392 e - / Å / s ( 1 . 0318 e - / Å2 / frame ) at the detector level and total accumulated 1091 dose was 51 . 59 e - / Å2 . 1092 1093 Cryo - EM data processing 1094 A total of 3576 movie stacks were collected , motion - corrected and binned to 1 . 137 Å / pixel using 1095 MotionCor2 in RELION3 . 1 84 , and CTF - corrected using Ctffind 4 . 1 . 13 85 ( See Supplemental Fig . 1096 7 ) . Micrographs with a Ctffind reported resolution estimate worse than 5 Å were discarded . A 1097 particle set generated from manual picking and template - based autopicking in RELION3 . 1 was 1098 cleaned and processed to 60 , 803 particles representing diverse views of the SWELL1 particle . 1099 These particles were then used to train Topaz 86 to pick a set of 936 , 282 particles . This set was 1100 cleaned with 2D classification and heterogeneous refinement in cryoSPARCv2 . We then 1101 generated a refinement in cryoSPARCv2 and then RELION3 . 1 using C6 symmetry and utilized 1102 this map to perform Bayesian Polishing . Polished particles were then refined in RELION3 . 1 with 1103 C6 symmetry with a mask for the extracellular domain ( ECD ) , transmembrane , and linker domains 1104 of SWELL1 to 3 . 05 Å . This map did not show clear evidence of drug density in the ECD , which 1105 we hypothesized could be due to a combination of partial drug occupancy and asymmetric drug 1106 density ( off the symmetry axis of SWELL1 ) . To test this hypothesis we performed symmetry 1107 expansion ( in C6 ) followed by sequential 3D classification with C1 symmetry in RELION3 . 1 using 1108 an increasingly tightened mask on the ECD . We noted and selected classes with putative drug 1109 density in the ECD . We then used C1 refinement with C6 symmetry relaxation 48 in RELION3 . 1 to 1110 further refine the density . These refinement angles were used for one additional 3D classification 1111 job to generate 2 classes : one with vertical density ( 85 , 831 particles ) and one with tilted density 1112 ( 78 , 324 particles ) . The particles in each of these classes were then refined an additional time with 1113 symmetry relaxation and local angular sampling . Finally , these angles were used in a refinement 1114 in C1 with masking for the ECD , transmembrane , and linker domain to generate the final maps . 1115 1116 Modeling and refinement 1117 Maps from refinement for the vertical and tilted drug density were used for modeling in Coot 87 . 1118 First , the model from 30 ( PDB : 6NZW ) was docked in the map density . As the lipid mix used in this 1119 study contained a majority of DOPE lipid , the lipid acyl chains between LRRC8A subunits were 1120 modeled as DOPE . The model and restraints for Smod7 were generated using Phenix . elbow 88 1121 and then SN - 407 was placed and refined in the putative drug density for each map . Real space 1122 refinement of each model was carried out using Phenix . real _ space _ refine . Molprobity 89 was used 1123 to evaluate the stereochemistry and geometry of the structure for subsequent rounds of manual 1124 adjustment in Coot and refinement in Phenix . Phenix . mtriage was then used map and model 1125 validation . Figures were prepared using Chimera 90 , ChimeraX 91 , Prism , and Adobe Photoshop 1126 and Illustrator software . 1127 1128 Quantitative RT - PCR 1129 3T3 - F442A preadipocytes cells treated with either vehicle ( DMSO ) or 10 µM SN - 401 for 96 h were 1130 solubilized in TRIzol and the total RNA was isolated using PureLink RNA kit ( Life Technologies ) . 1131 For differentiated adipocytes , vehicle or 10 µM SN - 401 were added during 7 - 11 days of 1132 differentiation for 96 h and then serum starved ( + DMSO / SN - 401 ) for 6 h and stimulated with 0 1133 and 10 nM insulin / serum containing media ( + DMSO or SN - 40X ) for 15 min and processed for 1134 RNA as described above . The cDNA synthesis , qRT - PCR reaction and quantification were carried 1135 out as described previously 24 . 1136 1137 Liver isolation , triglycerides and histology 1138 HFD mice treated with either vehicle or SN - 401 were anesthetized with 1 - 4 % isoflurane followed 1139 by cervical dislocation . Gross liver weights were measured and identical sections from right 1140 medial lobe of liver were dissected for further examinations . Total triglyceride content was 1141 determined by homogenizing 10 - 50 mg of tissue in 1 . 5 ml of chloroform : methanol ( 2 : 1 v / v ) and 1142 centrifuged at 12000 rpm for 10 mins at 4°C . An aliquot , 20 ul , was evaporated in a 1 . 5 ml 1143 microcentrifuge tube for 30 mins . Triglyceride content was determined by adding 100 µl of Infinity 1144 Triglyceride Reagent ( Fisher Scientific ) to the dried sample followed by 30 min incubation at RT . 1145 The samples were then transferred to a 96 well plate along with standards ( 0 - 2000 mg / dl ) and 1146 absorbance was measured at 540 nm and the final concentration was determined by normalizing 1147 to tissue weight . For histological examination , liver sections were fixed in 10 % zinc formalin and 1148 paraffin embedded for sectioning . Hematoxylin and eosin ( H & E ) stained sections were then 1149 assessed for steatosis grade , lobular inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning for non - alcoholic 1150 fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) scoring as described 46 , 92 , 93 . 1151 Quantification and statistical analysis 1152 Standard unpaired or paired two - tailed Student’s t - test were performed while comparing two 1153 groups . One - way Anova was used for multiple group comparison . For GTTs and ITTs , 2 - way 1154 analysis of variance ( Anova ) was used . The threshold for significance was 0 . 05 for all statistical 1155 comparisons . * , * * and * * * represent p - values of < 0 . 05 , < 0 . 01 and < 0 . 001 , respectively . All data 1156 are presented as mean ±SEM . Details of statistical analyses are presented in the figure legends . 1157 1158 Acknowledgements 1159 We thank R . Sigmund , J . Galbraith and M .
