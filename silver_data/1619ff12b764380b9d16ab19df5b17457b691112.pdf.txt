While previously a death sentence , combination therapy transformed HIV infection into a largely manageable , chronic condition , leading to the major - ity of people with HIV being over age 50 [ 1 ] . We have lit - tle understanding of the physical and psychosocial needs of this first cohort to age with HIV . Challenges associated with aging with HIV are compounded by discrimination due to race , gender , and sexual orientation . Many people aging with HIV have also endured significant trauma due to AIDS , including personal losses of friends and loved ones , contrib - uting to high rates of depression [ 2 ] . In mid - March 2020 , the COVID - 19 pandemic prompted “shelter - in - place” orders around the country . Older adults living with HIV are at increased risk for severe COVID - 19 complications due several factors including accentuated aging , being immunocompromised , and having higher rates of serious co - morbid conditions such as diabetes , cardio - vascular and kidney diseases [ 3 , 4 ] . People with complicat - ing health factors are cautioned by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to take extra precautions to avoid COVID - 19 . So while physical distancing is a necessary strategy to flatten the curve , ease pressure on the healthcare system , and protect the most vulnerable , the order further increases the isolation faced by people aging with HIV , and creates barriers to accessing medications , health services , and other resources . For many long - term HIV survivors , the current COVID - 19 pandemic parallels the early days of AIDS in many ways , with mirrored delays in acknowledg - ing and responding to the pandemic and lack of testing and treatment . Capacity to Respond to Needs and Community‑Based Participatory Research We partnered with the HIV + Aging Research Project , a community - based , nonprofit organization founded as a col - laboration between local HIV clinicians and people living with HIV , to study the clinical and psychosocial aspects of aging among long - term HIV survivors . We obtained a Patient - Centered Outcomes Research Institute ( PCORI ) engagement award , which was meant to build local capac - ity to conduct research through community - based participa - tory research ( CBPR ) approaches . Located in Palm Springs , California ( a popular retirement community in the Coachella Valley with the highest proportion of people aging with HIV in the United States ) , we have been working over the past five years to prepare stakeholders to conduct innovative and local research . As part of this , we formed a steering commit - tee led by research and community member co - leaders , and including older adults living with HIV , non - medical caregiv - ers of older adults with HIV , community - based organizations that serve people living with HIV , researchers , and health - care providers . The steering committee meets on a monthly basis , with a core team meeting weekly to be able to rapidly respond to emerging health concerns and priorities . As the COVID - 19 pandemic arrived , and the committee shifted to remote meetings , the urgency of the pandemic and under - standing the unmet needs of the community aging with HIV became apparent . Since the committee is responsive to cur - rent needs , they shifted their efforts to COVID - 19 with the * Annie L .

All stakeholders played a role in developing question topics and helped guide the creation of the survey to be most beneficial to people aging with HIV . A Rapid Response Needs Assessment Recognizing the need for a rapid response , we designed the needs assessment as a one - time , anonymous , internet - based survey to assess the impact of COVID - 19 and mitigation efforts ( i . e . , shelter - in - place mandates , physical distancing guidelines ) on daily needs , mental and physical health needs , and social isolation . We utilized tools from the National Institutes of Health Disaster Research Response database ( www . dr2 . nlm . nih . gov ) , and instruments from researchers engaged in the field of HIV and aging . The initial survey was presented virtually at a steering committee meeting , and extensive feedback was received from community members and other stakeholders . Once we reached consensus on ques - tions , we then piloted the survey with 10 participants to iden - tify steps in the outreach protocol or instruments that needed refinement . In the implementation phase of the study , we reached out to local service - based groups in the Coachella Valley known to assist older adults living with HIV and dis - tributed recruitment emails to their members through their mailing lists . We were able to move from idea germination to survey implementation in less than three weeks . Data collection are ongoing but we report some initial , descriptive findings here ( N = 35 ) . Respondents were pre - dominantly white ( 91 . 4 % ) , gay men ( 91 . 4 % ) with a mean age of 63 . 5 years ( SD = 7 . 6 ) and a mean of 26 . 1 years ( SD = 8 . 6 ) living with HIV . Most participants ( 62 . 9 % ) reported that COVID - 19 impacted their lives “extremely” or “very much” and 60 . 0 % were fearful of getting COVID - 19 themselves , while 82 . 9 % were worried about friends , family , and loved ones getting COVID - 19 . Some participants ( 20 . 0 % ) stated that they were confused about where to obtain true and accu - rate information about COVID - 19 . Frustration ( 48 . 6 % ) , boredom ( 42 . 9 % ) , sleep disrup - tions ( 48 . 6 % ) , and not getting enough exercise ( 65 . 7 % ) were commonly reported by participants . Half ( 54 . 3 % ) reported experiencing anxiety and 22 . 9 % reported feelings of depression . In terms of substance use behaviors , 20 . 0 % reported increases in alcohol use , 14 . 3 % reported increases in marijuana use , and 5 . 7 % reported increases in other substance use during the pandemic . One - third experienced financial challenges because of COVID - 19 , 20 . 0 % experi - enced difficulty paying for basic needs like food , electric - ity , and rent , and 34 . 3 % state that they or someone in their household have requested unemployment benefits . How - ever , only 11 . 4 % have received unemployment benefits . Some participants ( 11 . 4 % ) reported skipping meals or reducing portions because they were worried they didn’t have enough money for food . Over a quarter of participants ( 28 . 6 % ) reported that they missed a dose of their HIV medication during the COVID - 19 pandemic , with the majority stating that they forgot as the reason for missing a dose . Several people further explained that COVID - 19 has been “a disorienting event” and that being “more stressed = more forgetful . ” On a Likert scale ranging from 1 ( not at all ) to 10 ( extremely ) , participants reported a mean of 6 . 3 ( SD = 2 . 6 ) for feeling socially isolated , with 41 . 3 % reporting in the upper range of 8 to 10 . Implications for Community Providers Our initial findings suggest COVID - 19 has significant impacts on mental health and exercise behaviors as well as negative implications for financial well - being . Impor - tantly for people aging with HIV , COVID - 19 appears to be causing disruption to medication adherence . In addition to the initial findings presented here , we reiterate the key role of CBPR in making this study possible . The speed at which we were able to respond was due to several factors : ( 1 ) our team’s existing networks of experts in HIV and aging , ( 2 ) an established steering committee with members who are familiar with reviewing and providing feedback about research , ( 3 ) relationships that have cultivated trust between academics and community members over time , and ( 4 ) a responsive institutional review board . Our next step is to provide data in real - time to local service based groups in the Coachella Valley , so organi - zations can respond to the emergent needs of older adults living with HIV . At the completion of the study , findings will contribute to understanding the impact of COVID - 19 on older adults living with HIV with implications for emergency preparedness in order to better prepare for the ongoing threat of COVID - 19 and the next public health crisis or pandemic . There will not be an immediate end to the COVID - 19 pandemic and people in the most vulner - able groups , including people aging with HIV , may need to shelter - in - place long after much of their surrounding community is able to return to a semblance of normal life .
