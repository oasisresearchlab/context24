Initially , these focused on non‑ pharmaceutical interventions ; more recently , vaccinations and large‑scale rapid testing have started to play a major role . The objective of this study is to explain the quantitative effects of these policies on determining the course of the pandemic , allowing for factors like seasonality or virus strains with different transmission profiles . To do so , the study develops an agent‑based simulation model , which explicitly takes into account test demand and behavioral changes following positive tests . The model is estimated using data for the second and the third wave of the CoViD‑19 pandemic in Germany . The paper finds that during a period where vaccination rates rose from 5 to 40 % , seasonality and rapid testing had the largest effect on reducing infection numbers . Frequent large‑scale rapid testing should remain part of strategies to contain CoViD‑19 ; it can substitute for many non‑pharmaceutical interventions that come at a much larger cost to individuals , society , and the economy . Since early 2020 , the CoViD - 19 pandemic has presented an enormous challenge to humanity on many dimen - sions . The development of highly effective vaccines holds the promise of containment in the medium term . However , most countries find themselves many months—and often years—away from reaching vaccination levels that would end the pandemic or even protect the most vulnerable 1 . In the meantime , it is of utmost importance to employ an effective mix of strategies for containing the virus . The most frequent initial response was a set of non - pharmaceutical interventions ( NPIs ) to reduce contacts between individuals . While this has allowed some countries to sustain equilibria with very low infection numbers—see Contreras et al . 2 for a theoretical equilibrium at low case numbers which is sustained with test - trace - and - isolate policies— , most have seen large fluctuations of infection rates over time . Containment measures have become increasingly diverse and now include rapid testing , more nuanced NPIs , and contact tracing . Neither these policies’ effects nor the influence of seasonal patterns or of more infectious virus strains are well understood in quantitative terms . This paper develops a quantitative model incorporating these factors simultaneously . The framework allows to combine a wide variety of data and mechanisms in a timely fashion , making it useful to predict the effects of various interventions . Behavioral reactions to symptoms or positive tests are explicitly taken into account . We apply the model to Germany , where new infections fell by almost 80 % during May 2021 . Our analysis shows that , aside from seasonality , frequent and large - scale rapid testing caused the bulk of this decrease , which is in line with prior predictions 3 . We conclude that it should have a large role for at least as long as vaccinations have not been offered to an entire population . Model description At the core of our agent - based model 4 , 5 —we review more literature in Supplementary Material B . 1—are physical contacts between heterogeneous agents ( Fig . 1a ) . Each contact between an infectious individual and somebody susceptible to the disease bears the risk of transmitting the virus . Contacts occur in up to four networks : Within the household , at work , at school , or in other settings ( leisure activities , grocery shopping , medical appointments , etc . ) . Some contacts recur regularly , others occur at random . Empirical applications can take the population and household structure from census data and the network - specific frequencies of contacts from diary data measuring OPEN 1 Bonn Graduate School of Economics , 53113 Bonn , Germany . 2 IZA Institute of Labor Economics , 53113 Bonn , Germany . 3 Private sector , Hamburg , Germany . 4 Rheinische Friedrich - Wilhelms - Universität Bonn , 53113 Bonn , Germany . * email : hmgaudecker @ uni - bonn . de 2 Vol : .

Within each network , meeting frequencies depend on age and geographical location ( see Supplementary Material A . 4 ) . The four contact networks are chosen so that the most common NPIs can be modeled in great detail . NPIs affect the number of contacts or the risk of transmitting the disease upon having physical contact . The effect of different NPIs will generally vary across contact types . For example , a mandate to work from home will reduce the number of work contacts to zero for a fraction of the working population . Schools and daycare can be closed entirely , operate at reduced capacity—including an alternating schedule— , or implement mitigation measures like masking requirements or air filters 8 . Curfews may reduce the number of contacts in settings outside of work and school . In any setting , measures like masking requirements would reduce the probability of infection associated with a contact 9 . In the model , susceptibility to contracting the SARS - CoV - 2 virus is dependent on age 10 , 11 . A possible infection progresses as shown in Fig . 1b .

Translating all infections to recorded ones Figure 1 . A description of the model can be found in Supplementary Material B . ( a ) The influence of an agent’s contacts to other agents on infections . Demographic characteristics set the baseline number of contacts in different networks ( η ) . The agents may reduce the number of contacts due to NPIs , showing symptoms , or testing positively for SARS - CoV - 2 ( τ ) . Infections may occur when a susceptible agent meets an infectious agent ; the probability depends on the type of contact ( β c ) , on seasonality ( κ c ) , and on NPIs ( ρ c , t ) . If infected , the infection progresses as depicted in ( b ) . If rapid tests are available , agents’ demand is modeled as in ( c ) . All reasons trigger a test only for a fraction of individuals depending on an individual compliance parameter ; the thresholds for triggering test demand differ across reasons and they may depend on calendar time ( π c , t and τ c , t ) . ( d ) The model of translating all infections in the simulated data to age - specific recorded infections . The model uses data on the aggregate share of recorded cases ( ψ ) , the share of positive PCR tests triggered by symptoms ( χ symptom ) , and the false positive rate of rapid tests ( p positive | infected , i , t ) . The lower part of the graph is relevant only for periods where rapid tests are available . All parameters are explained in Supplementary Material A . 11 . 3 Vol . : ( 0123456789 ) Scientific Reports | ( 2022 ) 12 : 8048 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 022 - 12015 - 9 www . nature . com / scientificreports / showing symptoms , being infectious ( presymptomatic or asymptomatic ) , showing symptoms , requiring inten - sive care , and recovery or death ( similar to 4 ) . The probabilities of transitioning between these states depend on age ; their duration is random and calibrated to medical literature ( for a detailed description see Supplementary Material A . 1 ) . Conditional on the type of contact , infectiousness is independent of age 12 . The model includes several other features , which are crucial to describe the evolution of the pandemic in 2020 - 2021 . New virus strains with different infectiousness profiles may appear . Vaccines may become available . During the vaccine roll - out , priority may depend on age and occupation ; vaccine hesitancy is modelled by some individuals refusing vaccination offers . With some probability , vaccinated agents become immune and do not transmit the virus 13 – 16 . We include two types of tests . Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) tests reveal whether an individual is infected or not ; there is no uncertainty to the result . PCR tests require at least one day to be processed and there are aggregate capacity constraints . In contrast , rapid antigen tests yield immediate results . Specificity and sensitivity of these tests is set according to data analyzed in 17 – 19 ; sensitivity depends on the timing of the test relative to the onset of infectiousness as in 20 . We analyze robustness to different assumptions in Supplementary Material B . 12 . After a phase - in period , all tests that are demanded will be performed . Figure 1c shows our model for rapid test demand . Schools may require staff and students to be tested regularly . Rapid tests may be offered by employers to on - site workers . Individuals may demand tests for private reasons , which include having plans to meet other people , showing symptoms of CoViD - 19 , and a household member having tested positively for the virus . We endow each agent with an individual compliance parameter . This parameter determines whether she takes up rapid tests . Positive test results or symptoms lead most individuals to reduce their contacts ; this is why tests impact the actual contacts in Fig . 1 . Modelling a population of agents according to actual demographic characteristics means that we can use a wide array of data to identify and calibrate the model’s many parameters ( see Supplementary Material A for a complete description ) . Contact diaries yield pre - pandemic distributions of contacts for different contact types and their assortativity by age group . Mobility data is used to model the evolution of work contacts . School and daycare policies can be incorporated directly from official directives . Administrative records on the number of tests , vaccinations by age and region , and the prevalence of virus strains are generally available . Surveys may ask about test offers , propensities to take them up , and past tests . Other studies’ estimates of the seasonality of infec - tions can be incorporated directly . The remaining parameters—most notably , these include infection probabilities by contact network and the effects of some NPIs , see Supplementary Material A . 9—will be chosen numerically so that the model matches features of the data ( see 21 for the general method ) . In our application , we keep the number of free parameters low in order to avoid overfitting . The data features to be matched include official case numbers for each age group and region , deaths , and the share of the B . 1 . 1 . 7 strain . The main issue with official case numbers is that they will contain only a fraction of all infections . In the Ger - man case , this specifically amounts to positive PCR tests . We thus model recorded cases as depicted in Fig . 1d . We take mortality - based aggregate estimates of the share of detected cases and use data on the share of PCR tests administered because of CoViD - 19 symptoms . As the share of asymptomatic individuals varies by age group , this gives us age - specific shares ( see Fig . B . 11 ) . Our estimates suggest that—in the absence of rapid testing—the detection rate is 80 % higher on average for individuals above age 80 compared to school age children . Once rapid test become available , confirmation of a positive result is another reason leading to positive PCR tests . Second and third waves of the CoViD‑19 pandemic in Germany The model is applied to the second and third waves of the CoViD - 19 pandemic in Germany , covering the period mid - September 2020 to the end of May 2021 . Figure 2 describes the evolution of the pandemic and of its drivers . The black line in Fig . 2a shows officially recorded cases ; the black line in Fig . 2b the Oxford Response Stringency Index 22 , which tracks the tightness of non - pharmaceutical interventions . The index is shown for illustration of the NPIs , we never use it directly . For legibility reasons , we transform the index so that lower values represent higher levels of restrictions . A value of zero means all measures incorporated in the index are turned on . The value one represents the situation in mid - September , with restrictions on gatherings and public events , masking requirements , but open schools and workplaces . In the seven weeks between mid September and early Novem - ber , cases increased by a factor of ten . Restrictions were somewhat tightened in mid - October and again in early November . New infections remained constant throughout November before rising again in December , prompt - ing the most stringent lockdown to this date . Schools and daycare centers were closed , so were customer - facing businesses except for grocery and drug stores . From the peak of the second wave just before Christmas until the trough in mid - February , newly detected cases decreased by almost three quarters . The third wave in the spring of 2021 is associated with the B . 1 . 1 . 7 ( Alpha ) strain , which became dominant in March ( Fig . 2c ) . Note that we do not model B . 1 . 617 . 2 ( Delta ) . That variant was first detected in Germany in April ; at the end of our simulation period it accounted for less than 5 % of cases . In early March , some NPIs were relaxed ; e . g . , hairdressers and home improvement stores were allowed to open again to the public . There were many changes in details of regulations afterwards , but they did not change the overall stringency index . By March 2021 , the set of policy instruments had become much more diverse . Around the turn of the year , the first people were vaccinated with a focus on older age groups and medical staff ( Fig . 2d ) . Until the end of May , 43 % had received at least one dose of a vaccine . In late 2020 , rapid tests started to replace regular PCR tests for staff in many medical and nursing facilities . These had to be administered by medical doctors or in pharmacies . At - home tests approved by authorities became available in mid - March . Rapid test centers were opened , and one test per person and week was made available free of charge . In several states , customers were only allowed to enter certain stores with a recent negative rapid test result . These developments are characteristic of many countries : The initial focus on NPIs to slow the spread of the disease has been accompanied by vaccines and 4 Vol : .

At broadly similar points in time , novel strains of the virus have started to pose additional challenges . Results We draw simulated samples of agents from the population structure in September 2020 and use the model to predict recorded infection rates until the end of May 2021 . See Supplementary Materials A . 2 and B . 9 for details . The blue line in Fig . 2a shows that our model’s predictions are very close to officially recorded cases in the aggre - gate . This is also true for infections by age and geographical region ( see Supplementary Material B . 10 ) . The effects of various mechanisms can be disentangled due to the distinct temporal variation in the drivers of the pandemic . Next to the stringency index , the three lines in Fig . 2b summarize how contact reductions , increased hygiene regulations , and seasonality evolved since early September for each of the three broad contact networks . For example , a value of 0 . 75 for the work multiplier means that if the environment was the same as in September ( levels of infection rates , no rapid tests or vaccinations , only the wildtype virus present ) , infections at the workplace would be reduced by 25 % . Two aspects are particularly interesting . First , all lines broadly follow the stringency index and they would do so even more if we left out seasonality and school vacations ( roughly the last two weeks of October , two weeks each around Christmas and Easter , and some days in late May ) . Second , the most stringent regulations coincide with the period of decreasing infection rates between late December 2020 and mid - February 2021 . The subsequent reversal of the trend is associated with the spread of the B . 1 . 1 . 7 variant . During the steep drop in recorded cases during May 2021 , for 42 % of the population took at least one rapid tests per week , the first - dose vaccination rate rose from 28 % to 43 % , and seasonality lowered the relative infectiousness of contacts . In order to better understand the contributions of rapid tests , vaccinations , and seasonality on the evolution of infections in 2021 , Fig . 3 considers various scenarios . NPIs are always held constant at their values in the baseline scenario . Figure 3a shows the model fit ( the blue line , same as in Fig . 2a ) , a scenario without any of the three factors ( red line ) , and three scenarios turning each of these factors on individually . Figure 3b does the same for total infections in the model . Figure 3c employs Shapley values 23 to decompose the difference in total infections between the scenario without any of the three factors and our main specification . a .

The Oxford Response Stringency Index is scaled as 2 · ( 1 − x / 100 ) , so that a value of one refers to the situation at the start of our sample period and zero means that all NPIs included in the index are turned on . The other lines in ( b ) show the product of the effect of contact reductions , increased hygiene regulations , and seasonality . See Appendix A . 5 for separate plots of the three factors by contact type . 5 Vol . : ( 0123456789 ) Scientific Reports | ( 2022 ) 12 : 8048 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41598 - 022 - 12015 - 9 www . nature . com / scientificreports / Until mid - March , there is no visible difference between the different scenarios . Seasonality hardly changes , and only few vaccinations and rapid tests were administered . Even thereafter , the effect of the vaccination cam - paign is surprisingly small at first sight . Whether considering recorded or total infections with only one channel active , the final level is always the highest in case of the vaccination campaign ( orange lines ) . The Shapley value decomposition shows that vaccinations contribute 16 % to the cumulative difference between scenarios . Reasons for the low share are the slow start—it took until March 24th until 10 % of the population had received their first vaccination , the 20 % mark was reached on April 19th—and the focus on older individuals . These groups contribute less to the spread of the disease than others due to a lower number of contacts . By the end of our study period , when first - dose vaccination rates reached 43 % of the population , the numbers of new cases would have started to decline . It is important to note that the initial focus of the campaign was to prevent deaths and severe disease . Indeed , the case fatality rate was considerably lower during the third wave when compared to the second ( 4 . 4 % between October and February and 1 . 4 % between March and the end of May ) . Seasonality has a large effect in slowing the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 . By May 31 , both observed and total cases would be reduced by a factor of four if only seasonality mattered . However , in this period , cases would have kept on rising throughout , just at a much lower pace this is in line with results in 24 , which our seasonality measure is based on . Nevertheless , we estimate seasonality to be a quantitatively important factor determining the evolution of the pandemic , explaining most of the early changes and 43 % of the cumulative difference by the end of May . A similar - sized effect—42 % in the decomposition—comes from rapid testing . Here , it is crucial to differentiate between recorded cases and actual cases . Additional testing means that additional infections will be recorded which would otherwise remain undetected . Figure 3a shows that this effect is large and may persist for some time . Until late April , recorded cases are higher in the scenario with rapid testing alone when compared to the setting where none of the three mechanisms are turned on . The effect on total cases , however , is visible immediately in Fig . 3b . Despite the fact that only 10 % of the population performed weekly rapid tests in March on average , new infections on April 1 would have been reduced by 53 % relative to the scenario without vaccinations , rapid tests , or seasonality . In Supplementary Material B . 12 , we provide a detailed analysis of whether our results are robust regarding the sensitivity parameters we assume for rapid tests . Even if we take a pessimistic stance , the effect is only reduced from 42 % to 38 % . So why is rapid testing so effective ? In order to shed more light on this question , Fig . 3d decomposes the difference in the scenario without rapid tests and the main specification into the three channels for rapid tests . Tests at schools have the smallest effect , which is largely explained by schools not operating at full capacity dur - ing our period of study and the relatively small number of students ( 18 % of our population are in the education sector , e . g . , pupils , teachers ; 46 % are workers outside the education sector ) . Almost 40 % come from tests at the a . Recorded cases : 2021 scenarios b . Total cases : 2021 scenarios c .

The blue line in ( a ) is the same as in ( a ) and refers to our baseline scenario , so does the blue line in ( b ) . The red lines refer to a situation where NPIs evolve as in the baseline scenario and the B . 1 . 1 . 7 variant is introduced in the same way ; vaccinations , rapid tests , and seasonality remain at their January levels . The other scenarios turn each of these three factors on individually . The decompositions in ( c , d ) are based on Shapley values , which are explained more thoroughly in Appendix A . 10 .

Despite the fact that rapid tests for private reasons are phased in only in mid - March , they make up for more than half of the total effect . The reason lies in the fact that a substantial share of these tests is driven by an elevated probability to carry the virus , i . e . , showing symptoms of CoViD - 19 or following up on a positive test of a household member . The latter is essentially a form of contact tracing , which has been shown to be very effective 2 , 25 , 26 . Indeed , a deeper analysis in Supplementary Material B . 15 shows that the same amount of rapid tests administered randomly in the population would not have been nearly as effective . Discussion and conclusions Having quantified the effects of various mechanisms , we now simulate hypothetical scenarios comparing changes in NPIs and testing regimes . Two of the most contentious NPIs concern schools and mandates to work from home . In many countries , schools switched to remote instruction during the first wave , so did Germany . After the summer break , they were operating at full capacity with increased hygiene measures , before being closed again from mid - December onward . Some states started opening them gradually in late February , but operation at normal capacity did not resume until the beginning of June . Figure 4a shows the effects of different policies regarding schools starting after Easter , at which point rapid tests had become widely available . We estimate the realized scenario to have essentially the same effect as a situation with closed schools . Under fully opened schools with mandatory tests , total infections would have been 6 % higher ; this number rises to 20 % without tests . These effect sizes are broadly in line with empirical studies ( e . g . 27 , 28 , see Supplementary Material B . 11 for a comparison ) . In light of the large negative effects school closures have on children and parents 29 , 30 —and in particular on those with low socio - economic status—these results in conjunction with hindsight bias suggest that opening schools combined with a testing strategy would have been beneficial . In other situations , and particular when rapid test are not available at scale , trade - offs may well be different . Figure 4b shows that with a large fraction of workers receiving tests , testing at the workplace has larger effects than mandating employees to work from home . Whether the share of workers working at the usual workplace is reduced or increased by ten percent changes infection rates by 2 . 5 % or less in either direction . Making testing mandatory twice a week—assuming independent compliance by employers and workers of 95 % each—would have reduced infections by 23 % . Reducing rapid tests offers by employers to the level of March would have increased infections by 13 % . Our analysis has shown that during the transition to high levels of vaccination and possibly thereafter , large - scale rapid testing can substitute for some NPIs . This comes at a fraction of the cost . A week of the fairly strict lockdown in early 2021 is estimated to have cost around 50 Euros per capita 31 ; retail prices for rapid tests were below one Euro in early June 2021 and below five Euros for firms . While we do not distinguish between self - administered rapid tests and point of care rapid tests , the former are likely to play a larger role for indication - driven testing . Widespread availability at low prices seems important . However , they rely on purely voluntary participation in a non - public setting . The benefit of point - of - care rapid tests as a precondition to participate in leisure activities as well as mandatory tests at the workplace or at school come from screening the entire popula - tion . This is important because disadvantaged groups are less likely to be reached by testing campaigns relying on voluntary participation ( e . g . 32 ) ; at the same time , these groups have a higher risk to contract CoViD - 19 33 . Mandatory tests at school and at the workplace will extend more into these groups . The same goes for individu - als who exhibit a low level of compliance with CoViD - 19 - related regulations . Compared to vaccinations , rapid testing programmes allow a much quicker roll - out , making it arguably the most effective tool to contain the pandemic in the short run .
