The lipid nanoparticle ( LNP ) , as a non - viral vector with good safety and potency factors , is applied to mRNA delivery in the clinic . Among the recently FDA - approved SARS - CoV - 2 mRNA vaccines , lipid - based nanoparticles have been shown to be well - suited to antigen presentation and enhanced immune stimulation to elicit potent humoral and cellular immune responses . However , a design strategy for optimal mRNA - LNP vaccines has not been fully elaborated . In this review , we comprehensively and systematically discuss the research strategies for mRNA - LNP vaccines against COVID - 19 , including antigen and lipid carrier selection , vaccine preparation , quality control , and stability . Meanwhile , we also discuss the potential development directions for mRNA – LNP vaccines in the future . We also conduct an in - depth review of those technologies and scientiﬁc insights in regard to the mRNA - LNP ﬁeld . Keywords : COVID - 19 ; mRNA ; lipid nanoparticle ; preparation ; quality control ; stability 1 . Introduction The unprecedented impact on public health and economic development of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 or COVID - 19 ) was evident in December 2019 . There were approximately 400 million conﬁrmed cases and a mortality rate of about 1 . 4 % in February 2022 . Vaccines have been widely recognized by the public for their success and effectiveness in preventing disease . Moreover , various forms of therapy and prophylactic vaccines , including peptides , RNA - , viral vector - , DNA - , and protein - based vaccines , have been developed since the outbreak of COVID - 19 [ 1 , 2 ] . The most promising vaccine candidates have been transited from viral vector - and protein - based technologies into messenger RNA ( mRNA ) and lipid nanoparticle ( LNP ) technologies . The mRNA vaccine consists of mRNA encoding a particular antigenic protein into the human body , directly translated to form the corresponding antigen protein , thereby eliciting a potent immune system response to produce antibodies against diseases [ 3 , 4 ] . One of the key advantages of mRNA vaccines is that they can be designed and manufactured within a short time scale to meet human requirements , which makes them very appropriate for responding to the pandemic . It is essential for the effective delivery of mRNA in vivo to achieve preventive effects . However , exogenous mRNA must cross the barrier of the host cell membrane into the cytoplasm and translate into immunogenic proteins [ 5 ] . The mRNA vaccine is quite unstable and requires the assistance of some vectors in the cell membrane of the host cells . Additionally , the sensitivity of mRNA vaccines to RNA enzyme - catalyzed hydrolysis pose signiﬁcant challenges to their intracellular delivery [ 6 , 7 ] . LNPs are , clinically , one of the most advanced mRNA carriers that can load and deliver mRNA to cells while avoiding mRNA degradation [ 8 , 9 ] . After the mRNA is delivered to a cell , it instructs the cell to produce protein , thereby eliciting an immune response . Therefore , Polymers 2022 , 14 , 4195 . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 3390 / polym14194195 https : / / www . mdpi . com / journal / polymers Polymers 2022 , 14 , 4195 2 of 19 using mRNA , LNP , and delivery system technologies achieve a desired biological response . To date , the research conducted on mRNA – LNP vaccines used to combat viral diseases , including Ebola , Zika , HIV , inﬂuenza , and cytomegalovirus infections , has been performed in many countries . Table 1 summarizes some of the applications of RNA - loaded LNPs that have been reported in the literature . It is worth emphasizing that a COVID - 19 vaccine with LNPs used as a delivery vehicle developed by BioNTech / Pﬁzer and Moderna has been granted emergency authorization from the U . S . Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) ( Table 2 ) [ 10 – 12 ] . Table 1 . LNP - based mRNA vaccines .

Selection of Immunogens The immunogen plays an irreplaceable role in the process of vaccine development . The ideal immunogen can produce a persistent humoral and cellular immune response via stimulating the host cell [ 25 ] . SARS - CoV - 2 is a novel β - coronavirus with a genome size of approximately 30 kb [ 26 – 29 ] . That is , no fewer than 84 , 000 complete genomes in SARS - CoV - 2 sequences ( > 29 kb ) have been recorded in the Global Initiative of Sharing All Inﬂuenza Data ( GISAID ) database [ 29 , 30 ] . The high volume of gene sequencing data provide a great opportunity to develop vaccines and understand the trend of virus evolution . When imaged by transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) , it can be observed that SARS - CoV - 2 is spherical in shape with a particle size of 70 – 130 nanometers ( Figure 1A ) . The four major structural proteins of SARS - CoV - 2 are as follows ( Figure 1B ) : spike protein ( S ) , envelope protein ( E ) , membrane glycoprotein ( M ) , and nucleocapsid protein ( N ) . In addition , SARS - CoV - 2 contains a positive - sense , single - stranded RNA genome related to nucleoproteins [ 30 , 31 ] . The S protein is a homologous trimer distributed on the surface of COVID - 19 that mediates it into cells during the infection process [ 32 , 33 ] . Additionally , the S protein consists of S1 and S2 subunits [ 27 , 34 ] . The S1 subunit is located outside the envelope of the virus , which is mainly combined with vascular angiotensin - converting enzyme 2 ( ACE2 ) [ 25 , 35 , 36 ] , and the latter is the transmembrane subunit that can mediate the fusion of viral and cellular membranes [ 37 ] . The S1 region contains the receptor - binding domain ( RBD ) , whereas the S2 subunit contains a putative fusion peptide , transmembrane domain , and two heptad repeat regions called heptad repeats 1 and 2 ( HR1 and HR2 ) [ 38 – 41 ] . During the early stages of virus infection , the S protein plays a major role and effectively induces the reaction of T cells in the body [ 32 ] . Recently , substantial evidence proved that the SARS - CoV - 2 infection could stimulate the production of S - protein - speciﬁc CD4 + and CD8 + T cells [ 42 , 43 ] . The special structure of the S protein provides a potential therapeutic target for the development of broad - spectrum anti - coronavirus drugs . The S protein regulates its exposure to receptor binding sites and subsequently undergoes structural rearrangements to drive fusion between the virus and the cell membrane [ 27 , 44 ] . Therefore , many vaccines in development , at present , target the S protein as the main antigen . The N protein , the most abundant protein in virions , plays a vital role in the en - capsidation of viral genomic and antigenomic RNA in a ribonucleoprotein complex [ 45 ] . Moreover , N proteins have an essential role in viral genomic RNA replication and mRNA transcription [ 46 , 47 ] . Furthermore , they are involved in the immune - regulation process [ 48 ] . N proteins can stimulate a strong TH2 response and induce tissue damage , for which it may be difﬁcult to provide effective protection [ 49 ] . The E protein is only a minor mem - brane component , but nevertheless has an important effect on in coronavirus assembly [ 50 ] . Structural M proteins mainly mediate the assembly and release of enveloped viral particles , Polymers 2022 , 14 , 4195 4 of 19 and exert an important role in the structural stability and functional expression of other proteins [ 51 ] . Thus , the other structural proteins of SARS - CoV - 2 are not deemed as an effective vaccine immunogen for clinical study . Polymers 2022 , 14 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 21 Figure 1 .

Selection of Delivery Vehicle mRNA presents great potential in the application of viral vaccines , cancer immuno - therapy , and genome editing [ 4 , 52 , 53 ] . Nucleic acid is highly susceptible to degradation by several nucleases in vivo [ 3 ] , so it is required for the development of effective and safe drug delivery systems ( DDSs ) to reach specific target cells and produce potent and pre - dictable effects . At present , different types of delivery methods have been commonly ex - ploited as DDSs for nucleic acids ( Figure 2 ) [ 54 ] . Particular attention has been paid to de - signing lipid - based mRNA DDSs that protect nucleic acids and ensure their targeted de - livery , controlled release , and enhanced cellular uptake .

Lipid Nanoparticles Nanoparticles have a wide range of biomedical applications due to their advanced technology [ 56 ] . In particular , LNPs are among the most commonly used mRNA delivery vehicles in both preclinical and clinical studies [ 57 – 59 ] . LNPs may present a micelle - like structure that encapsulates nucleic acids inside a non - aqueous core , rather than a lipid bilayer enclosing an aqueous core in traditional liposomes [ 60 – 62 ] . Both mRNA and cell membranes are negatively charged , so mRNA cannot cross the cell membrane alone for protein expression . On the contrary , positively charged LNPs have a well - complexed sys - tem with the nucleic acid content under the influence of electrostatic action [ 60 , 63 , 64 ] . No - tably , LNPs were initially employed to develop siRNA delivery . Subsequently , the LNP formulation was used to deliver mRNA for cancer immunotherapy in 2014 [ 65 ] . In com - parison to other drug carriers , LNPs present numerous advantages [ 12 , 60 , 66 , 67 ] . For ex - ample , LNPs can effectively encapsulate mRNA for effective and efficient delivery into a cell [ 68 ] . Moreover , LNPs consists of biocompatible materials suitable for human use , which can be synthesized at a large scale under the GMP level . More importantly , LNPs are robustly synthesized , and their components can be easily adjusted to increase cellular uptake and reduce cellular toxicity [ 12 ] . LNPs are mainly composed of a cationic / ionizable lipid and helper lipids , such as phospholipids , cholesterol , and / or poly ( ethylene glycol ) ( PEG ) lipids [ 12 , 60 , 69 , 70 ] . The structures of lipids commonly used for mRNA delivery are presented in Figure 3 [ 71 ] , including preclinical studies , clinical stages and authorized lipids . In the context of the Figure 2 .

Notably , LNPs were initially employed to develop siRNA delivery . Subsequently , the LNP formulation was used to deliver mRNA for cancer immunotherapy in 2014 [ 65 ] . In comparison to other drug carriers , LNPs present numerous advantages [ 12 , 60 , 66 , 67 ] . For example , LNPs can effectively encapsulate mRNA for effective and efﬁcient delivery into a cell [ 68 ] . Moreover , LNPs consists of biocompatible materials suitable for human use , which can be synthesized at a large scale under the GMP level .

LNPs are mainly composed of a cationic / ionizable lipid and helper lipids , such as phospholipids , cholesterol , and / or poly ( ethylene glycol ) ( PEG ) lipids [ 12 , 60 , 69 , 70 ] . The structures of lipids commonly used for mRNA delivery are presented in Figure 3 [ 71 ] , including preclinical studies , clinical stages and authorized lipids . In the context of the LNP system , the cationic / ionizable lipid is a critical component of LNPs . There is a head group with positive charges in cationic / ionizable lipids , which serves as two functions [ 23 , 72 ] : ( i ) increasing the cellular uptake and endosomal escape of the LNP system by disrupting the cell membrane ; and ( ii ) improving the mRNA stability and encapsulation efﬁciency of LNPs by forming electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged mRNA . The ionizable lipids are positively charged at a low pH level , but they remain neutral at a physiological pH [ 72 ] . Therefore , it is beneﬁcial for mRNA delivery to mediate passive entrapment and ensure a more biocompatible delivery system . The utilization of ionizable cationic lipids provides a solution for the biocompatibility issues of these systems [ 60 ] . Phospholipids and cholesterol contribute to the promotion of the stability of LNPs and endosomal escape by modulating membrane integrity and rigidity [ 23 ] . The research showed that cholesterol analogs with C - 24 alkyl phytosterols in LNPs can enhance the intracellular delivery of mRNA in vivo [ 73 ] . The PEG - lipid is used to control particle size , zeta potential , and reduce nonspeciﬁc interactions to prevent aggregation under storage [ 74 ] . In terms of marketed RNA vaccines , the PEG - lipids used in Moderna and Biontech’s mRNA vaccines are PEG - 2000 conjugates . mRNA – LNP formulations containing PEG2000 - DMG have a higher delivery efﬁcacy in vivo than formulations containing ALC - 0159 [ 75 ] . Moreover , the separation of PEG2000 - DMG from LNPs is quicker than that of ALC - 0159 , thereby facilitating the cellular uptake and endosomal escape of LNPs . Lipid molecules of different compositions can wrap mRNA molecules inside them to form a spherical LNP , and LNPs with different particle sizes can be prepared by adjusting the prescription , as presented in Figure 4 . Therefore , to develop an effective mRNA vaccine for COVID - 19 , the LNPs can be appropriately designed and adjusted to obtain mRNA based on immunotherapies with high immunogenicity and good therapeutic outcomes .

Lipidomic studies have identified a wide variety of lipids in membranes . Changes in lipid organization can have effects on cellular functions , such as signal transduction and membrane trafficking [ 77 , 78 ] . Cholesterol is one of the most important regulators for lipid organization . Due to its unique mechanism , the body can maintain the level of cholesterol in the cell membrane within a suitable range [ 79 ] . The different types of lipid organization have important effects on membrane proteins . Many membrane proteins are more likely to be associated with specific types of lipid organiza - tion , which would lead to its physical separation in a bilayer with a lipid phase coexistence [ 80 , 81 ] . When genes or the environment change , the orderly arrangement of lipid organi - zation becomes disordered ; these membrane effects may cause discomfort in the human body . LNPs are nanoparticles formed by lipid components . When LNPs load genetic mate - rial into cells , the degree of impact on the morphology and function of the lipid organiza - tion is essential for the composition and dosage of the selection of LNPs . The development of more efficient and safer LNPs for intracellular mRNA delivery is a long - standing chal - lenge . LNPs are one of the most effective means of mRNA delivery . We can select an ap - propriate lipid composition or modify its structure to improve its biodegradability in vivo , so as to improve biocompatibility , avoid the toxicity and side effects caused by lipid ac - cumulation . At present , a series of studies mainly focus on the linker fragments of cationic lipids ( ionizable lipids ) , such as esters , amides , and mercaptans [ 82 ] . Dlin - mc3 - dma , ALC - 0315 , and SM - 102 all contain ester - bond linker fragments . Lipids linking degradable frag - ments are often rapidly cleared from the body and can be used in multiple doses with fewer side effects . Dlin - MC3 - DMA is an FDA - approved excipient . In order to further im - prove the therapeutic index of siRNA - LNP , its biodegradable version , L319 , was develop by adding ester bonds to the hydrophobic dialkyl chains , which enables the rapid elimi - nation of siRNA - LNPs in the liver [ 83 ] . ATX lipids ( Arcturus ) were also designed to con - tain an ionizable amino head group and a biodegradable lipid backbone , which can de - grade and scavenge in the liver much faster than Dlin - MC3 - DMA [ 84 ] . Embedding bio - degradable linker fragments in lipids may improve their biocompatibility and further pro - mote their elimination in vivo [ 83 ] . Therefore , it is important to develop new next - gener - ation lipids with a superior potency and biodegradable functions to further promote the development of the LNP platform . The main advantages of LNPs as DDSs include the tailored optimization of biophys - ical and biological characteristics to achieve efficient encapsulation and controlled release . The current review focused on the research overview of LNPs as a mRNA DDS . Figure 4 .

Other Types of Lipid - Based mRNA DDSs In addition to the LNPs previously mentioned , other types of lipid - based mRNA DDSs include hybrid biopolymers , lipoplexes ( LPXs ) , lipopolyplexes ( LPPs ) , and nanocapsules ( LNCs ) . Recently , lipid polymer hybrid nanoparticles ( LPNs ) have served as promising bio - materials for RNA delivery that integrate the physicochemical properties of both lipids and the polymers . The LPN can effectively protect and deliver mRNA to achieve the correct ex - pression of the corresponding protein . A study has shown that poly β - amino lipids ( PBAEs ) were coated with phospholipid bilayers , and then the mRNA was loaded onto the surface of the nanoparticles by an electrostatic interaction to deliver mRNA vaccines through nasal mucosa [ 85 ] . The results indicate that the LPN / mRNA complex is readily taken up by dendritic cells ( DC S ) and can deliver mRNA into the cytoplasm of DCs to reduce toxicity [ 85 ] . In addition , Ball et al . combined mRNA and siRNA into a polymer composed of lipids modiﬁed with ionizable lipids , cholesterol , and polyethylene glycol to investigate the co - delivery effect of mRNA and siRNA . The results show that siRNA and mRNA in the same LPN enhanced the drug efﬁcacy both in vivo and in vitro [ 86 ] . Using LPXs and LPPs to efﬁciently deliver nucleic acid has attracted the attention of many researchers . LPXs and LPPs can deliver genes to dendritic cells , which can better activate the immune response of T cells through antigen presentation , achieving the ideal immunotherapy ef - fect . At present , many cationic LPXs are used , such as polyethylene imine , poly ( β - amino ester ) , PBAE , and chitosan . BNT111 is an mRNA vaccine encoding NYESO - 1 , tyrosinase ( Tyr ) , MAGE - A3 , and TPTE developed by BioNTech , which are delivered intravenously to patients via RNA - LPX . The results showed that BNT111 can induce a speciﬁc antitumor immune response with good safety and tolerance [ 87 ] . Mockey et al . demonstrated that mice receiving systemic injections of MART1 mRNA histidylated LPPs were speciﬁcally and signiﬁcantly protected against B16F10 melanoma tumor progression [ 88 ] . LNCs are submicron particles composed of an oily liquid core surrounded by a solid or semisolid shell . LNCs are biomimetic nanocarriers used for the encapsulation of a wide variety of active ingredients . They are highly stable compared to other nanocarriers , and they have been observed to confer highly desirable characteristics to internally delivered therapeutic molecules [ 89 ] . The lipid - based mRNA DDSs mentioned above were not highlighted in the current review . 2 . 3 . Preparation of mRNA – LNP Vaccine The workﬂow of mRNA – LNP is presented in Figure 5 . First , the antigen gene was combined with blank plasmid by PCR technology to form a recombinant plasmid , and then the plasmid containing the target gene was introduced into the cells of E . coli bacterium . In order to obtain a large quantity of cloned genes , multiplying bacteria were cultured in LB liquid medium ( 37 ◦ C ) overnight . Generally , E . coli bacterium are lysed by an alkali to release the plasmids . Subsequently , the extracted plasmids needed to be sequenced to ensure that the gene sequence of the virus was not altered . Following the quality test , enzymes could linearize circular plasmids and separate the antigen genes . The linearized DNA was mixed with nucleoside triphosphate ( NTPs : ATP , GTP , UTP , and CTP ) using enzymes ( helicases ) to open the DNA template and transcribe it into mRNA . In addition to the target product , the in vitro transition of mRNA also contains many impurities , such as enzymes , abnormal transcription products , and DNA . The lithium chloride precipitation method is commonly used to purify mRNA , but the disadvantage of this method is that it cannot remove abnormal transcription products . Some studies have shown that the protein yield of mRNA puriﬁed by RP - HPLC has increased 10 – 1000 times [ 90 , 91 ] . In addition to the methods described above , the anion exchange , ultraﬁltration , magnetic bead , and dialysis methods can also be used for mRNA puriﬁcation . Following puriﬁcation , the mRNA was sequenced again to ensure the accuracy of the results . Finally , the mRNA was encapsulated in the lipid and formed vaccine particles . The ﬁnal stages of aseptic ﬁltration and packaging were completed after the quality test of the intermediate product was qualiﬁed .

Figure 5 . The workflow of mRNA – LNPs . In the past , ethanol injection and thin - film hydration were the preparation methods commonly used for obtaining LNP formulations . With the improvement of technology , large - scale production , which proves difficult for obtaining a greater mRNA encapsula - tion efficiency and uniform particle size , is generally no longer practiced [ 92 , 93 ] . Recently , the preparation of mRNA – LNPs utilizing T - junction - and microfluidic - mixing platforms has become a popular method . In this section , we focused on the preparation of mRNA – LNPs using microfluidic technology . In recent years , microfluidic devices and technolo - gies have been used for the preparation of LNPs . This technology provides many ad - vantages for the production of mRNA - LNPs , including precisely controlling LNP size , high reproducibility rate , and the provision of a continuous LNP production process . To date , a variety of microfluidic devices have been used in the development of nano - deliv - ery platforms , such as RNA , DNA , and LNP . This method is relatively convenient for demand rate and easy to achieve an increase in production . The specific process of prep - aration is as follows : first , a molar ratio of 50 : 10 : 38 . 5 : 1 . 5 ( ionizable lipid : helper lipid : cho - lesterol : PEG - lipid ) was dissolved in ethanol [ 94 , 95 ] . Then , all the nucleic acid was dis - solved in 20 – 25 mM of buffer ( citrate or sodium acetate buffers ) , pH 4 . 0 . Of note , the prep - aration and handling of the nucleic acid solutions were performed under sterile and RNAse - free conditions . Finally , the alcoholic solution of the lipids was mixed with the aqueous solution of the mRNA by utilizing a microfluidic mixing technique . The microfluidic mixing technique offers several advantages relative to other meth - ods . By using this method together with the mRNA , the components formed particles of approximately 60 – 100 nm in size [ 92 ] . Meanwhile , mRNA – LNPs with a high encapsula - tion efficiency ( approximately 90 % ) facilitated the manufacturing process of commercial mRNA drugs under GMP [ 63 , 96 ] . Recently , one study indicated that flow rate was nega - tively associated with the particle size and PDI of mRNA – LNPs [ 3 , 97 ] . However , the in - crement of the flow rate over 2 mL / min had no effect on the size of the nanoparticles [ 3 ] . Therefore , it is necessary to pay attention to the effects of different instrument parameters Figure 5 . The workﬂow of mRNA – LNPs .

Recently , one study indicated that ﬂow rate was negatively associated with the particle size and PDI of mRNA – LNPs [ 3 , 97 ] . However , the increment of the ﬂow rate over 2 mL / min had no effect on the size of the nanoparticles [ 3 ] . Therefore , it is necessary to pay attention to the effects of different instrument parameters on the particle size and PDI during the preparation process . Speciﬁcally , in order to obtain nanoparticles with a uniform particle size and good polydispersity index ( PDI ) , the ﬂow rates of the aqueous and organic phases were 1 . 5 mL / min and 0 . 5 mL / min , respectively [ 98 ] . Polymers 2022 , 14 , 4195 10 of 19 2 . 4 . Quality Control of mRNA Vaccines Most of the methods used in the preparation of mRNA – LNP are complex . Therefore , a perfect quality control system is crucial in determining the quality of the ﬁnal product . Safety , efﬁcacy , and quality control elements of the vaccine production process are de - termined by measuring the critical process parameters ( CPPs ) and intermediate critical quality attributes ( IQAs ) [ 99 ] . The target - gene sequence design , raw material , mRNA purity and integrity , and mRNA / lipid ratio are directly related to the quality of mRNA vaccines . The quality control of mRNA vaccines is mainly reﬂected in the plasmids , lipids , enzymes , nucleotides , semi - ﬁnished products , and ﬁnal products used in the production process [ 100 ] . mRNA molecules and lipid excipients are essential in the process of mRNA vaccine research . Plasmid is the starting material to produce mRNA , the quality of mRNA that determine the potency of vaccine . In the entire quality control process , the biological characteristics of plasmids , such as purity , the proportion of the superhelical structure and residual material extracted from plasmids , E . coli , copy number , and strain purity used in the plasmid transformation process , should also be considered . Lipids are primarily consid - ered in relation to their source , and physical and chemical characteristics ( e . g . , appearance , type , purity , and residual solvent ) . Lipids should also be evaluated for their function and compliance to applicable regulations for novel lipid excipients . In addition , the quality of mRNA – LNP intermediates was assessed using key indicators , such as mean particle size , particle - size distribution , mRNA content , encapsulation rate , and sterility . The mRNA vaccine can induce a strong immune response , the global demand is high , and the mRNA vaccine platform is a new form of technology , which encourages a greater demand for improved production technology , production scale , production cycle , and product quality of the mRNA vaccine [ 101 ] . Hence , it is essential to establish a set of quality management systems suitable for mRNA vaccines and apply it to the entire production process and life cycle of mRNA vaccines to ensure better product quality . 3 . The Stability of mRNA – LNP Vaccines The long - term stability for mRNA – LNP vaccines has always been a concern in terms of preparation and storage . To prevent the growth of the particle size and the loss of bioactivity , many mRNA – LNP formulations are generally stored at − 20 ◦ C or in even lower temperatures for several days [ 102 ] . Hence , these factors not only increase the cost of transportation , but are difﬁcult to popularize in countries lacking the cold chain . At present , for example , the Moderna mRNA - 1273 vaccine is often stored at temperature ranging from − 25 ◦ C to − 15 ◦ C , and is directly injected into the host following thawing [ 24 , 94 , 103 , 104 ] . The Pﬁzer / BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine needs to be stored at temperatures ranging from − 80 ◦ C to − 60 ◦ C , and then thawed and diluted with saline before injection [ 94 , 104 ] . Stability plays a critical role in the quality of mRNA – LNP vaccines . In this section , we discuss the physical and chemical stability of the mRNA vaccine and proposed the strategies to optimize mRNA vaccine stability . 3 . 1 . Physical Stability The physical stability of mRNA – LNP vaccines mainly includes the aggregation , fusion , and leakage of the encapsulated ingredient ( Figure 6 ) . The vaccine has poor storage stabil - ity , which is prone to some aggregation and fusion [ 105 ] . A size increase over time from LNP aggregation has been commonly observed in previous formulations [ 106 ] . The main reason for the aforementioned changes is the lipid crystalline type transition from high - to low - energy states , and the increase in the order of lattice . Ayat et al . also reported that LNPs aggregated and fused during storage [ 107 ] . In order to stabilize mRNA – LNP vaccines in storage , PEGylated lipids are usually added to the prescription [ 98 , 108 , 109 ] , which can pre - vent LNPs from aggregating . However , Schöttler S et al . documented that LNPs containing PEGylated lipids exhibit low cellular uptake and transfection rates [ 110 ] . As such , this is a critical factor for PEGylated lipids . For example , distearoyl - phosphatidylethanolamine ( DSPE ) - PEG2000 is connected to the LNP surface to prevent the leakage of the encapsulated Polymers 2022 , 14 , 4195 11 of 19 ingredient [ 48 ] . Notably , a frozen format has also been a favorable method used to retain stability , to date . Another measure is the addition of a stabilizer , such as sucrose or trehalose , which can prevent the fusion and aggregation of LNPs due to the high viscosity of lipids . Study from Rebecca L Ball et al . showed that LNPs accumulate in the freeze – thaw cycle , but the stability is retained when using freezing protectants , trehalose , and sucrose [ 111 ] . In the future , we should explore more suitable stabilizers to develop more stable products . Polymers 2022 , 14 , x FOR PEER REVIEW 12 of 21 that LNPs aggregated and fused during storage [ 107 ] .

In the future , we should explore more suitable stabilizers to develop more stable products . Figure 6 . Physical instability mechanisms of mRNA – LNPs . The stability , potential , and other properties of nanoparticles are influenced by the number ratio of positive and negative charges when mRNA – LNPs are synthesized . The positive charge is usually a cationic lipid with ionizable ammonium ( N ) , while the nega - tive charge is a nucleic acid molecule with a high quantity of phosphate ( P ) . These charges can be combined by electrostatic adsorption . The incorrect proportion of both products may lead to some defects , such as a particle size that is too large and poor stability . There - fore , it is very important to correctly calculate the ratio of negative and positive charges ( N / P ratio ) . The surface charge of a LNP is also one of the reasons affecting the physical stability of mRNA – LNP vaccines . The surface charge density of particles can affect the interaction between nanoparticles , which controls its stability [ 112 , 113 ] . Uncharged particles or par - ticles with a low charge density aggregate over time , while particles with a higher charge density repel each other , thereby preventing aggregation . 3 . 2 . Chemical Stability At present , chemical stability ( lipid and mRNA degradation ) is one of the key factors affecting the quality of mRNA – LNP vaccines . Compared to the DNA vaccine , the reason why mRNA – LNP vaccines are susceptible to oxidation / hydrolysis is that they are sensi - tive to temperature changes and contain lipids with unsaturated acyl chains . Hemolytic phospholipids and fatty acids , as the main degradation products of LNP preparation , not only result in certain toxicity in the body , but also increase the permeability of the drug and lead to the instability of the lipid bilayer [ 71 , 114 ] . Simultaneously , lipid oxidation is a chain reaction initiated by free radicals , preventing or slowing down the formation of hy - droxyl radicals , and hydroperoxides can effectively inhibit lipid oxidation .

Storage temperature , type of buffer , radiation , and pH are the main factors that affect lipid degradation . Nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) , mass spectrometry ( MS ) , gas chromatography ( GC ) , vibration spectroscopy , liquid chromatography , thin - layer chromatography ( TLC ) , and other methods are commonly used to analyze the chemical structure , molecular weight , and structural changes of lipids [ 115 – 120 ] . In addition to the chemical stability of LNPs , the chemical stability of nucleic acids plays an important role in the quality of mRNA vaccines . A review on the stability of nucleic acids stated that the effects of chemical degradation are irreversible , which directly affects the therapeutic effect of the vaccine [ 121 ] . Hydrolysis and oxidation are the most common forms of degradation . Oxidation results in the cleavage of bases , strand breaks , and changes Polymers 2022 , 14 , 4195 12 of 19 in the mRNA secondary structure . Hydrolysis occurs primarily at the phosphodiester bond that forms the main chain of the mRNA molecule [ 6 ] . At present , the developed mRNA vaccine is administered by intramuscular injection ( IM ) . The effective delivery and stability of mRNA vaccines in vivo are also affected by the physiological environment [ 64 ] . Studies have demonstrated that due to the lack of carrier protection , naked mRNA is susceptible to the destruction of various enzymes in vivo , causing it to rapidly degrade following administration [ 122 ] . mRNA is highly sensitive to ribonuclease hydrolases [ 123 ] . Therefore , the instability caused by mRNA hydrolysis to vaccine is also worthy of an in - depth study . It is currently unclear how water in the LNP core interacts with mRNA and the extent to which the degradation sites are protected by binding to ionizable cationic lipids . The mRNA includes 5 (cid:48) UTRs , 5 (cid:48) cap , 3 (cid:48) UTRs , an open reading frame ( ORF ) , and a poly ( A ) tail . Among them , 5 (cid:48) cap consists of a negatively charged 5 (cid:48) , 5 (cid:48) - triphosphate bridge , and a positively charged base N7 - methylguanosine ( Figure 7 ) , which directly affects the stability of mRNA . The 5 (cid:48) position of the mRNA loses the free end of the phosphate group with the addition of Cap - 0 , which prevents degradation by alkaline phosphatase . Meanwhile , methyl groups of the two nucleotides following CAP - 1 and Cap - 2 block the 2 (cid:48) OH groups , making it very stable to RNase A , RNase T1 , and RNase T2 [ 124 , 125 ] .

RNA conjugation refers to the covalent coupling of RNA to lipids , galactose , proteins / peptides or aptamers to prolong the circulation time in the body and increase the accumulation and uptake in speciﬁc tissues and cells . For example , the formation of RNA conjugates not only protects nucleic acids from degradation , but also enhances the binding to serum proteins [ 126 ] . Simultaneously , the structural modi - ﬁcations of the mRNA molecule are speciﬁcally designed to retain stability and increase the translation of the target antigen in vivo [ 124 ] . Cryo - TEM , small - angle X - ray scattering ( SAXS ) , and small - angle neutron scattering ( SANS ) are usually used to measure the structure of mRNA – LNPs . Using this method , Arteta et al . demonstrated that LNPs have a disordered vertical and horizontal hexagonal internal structure with a characteristic distance of approximately 6 nm when mRNA is present , whereas LNPs without mRNA do not present this structure [ 76 ] . They also ob - served that DSPC and PEG - lipids , as well as some ionizable cationic lipids and cholesterol , are located on the surface of LNPs . Ionizable cationic lipids , cholesterol ( depending on its concentration ) , water , and mRNA are mainly present in the nucleus . They demonstrated that mRNA is located in the water column surrounded by cationic lipids [ 76 ] . This suggests that the partial structural exposure of mRNA to water inside the LNP is one of the reasons Polymers 2022 , 14 , 4195 13 of 19 why mRNA is unstable when stored in non - frozen conditions . Lyophilization is a process by which aquatic products transform into a solid state at low temperatures , and then remove water by sublimation in vacuum . This is a relatively mild drying method that can improve the stability of nanoparticles [ 127 ] . The lyophilized mRNA – LNPs can increase the stability and extend the shelf life of the product , so that it can be stored at 4 ◦ C or at room temperature for a long period of time [ 128 ] . In the form of lyophilization , the mRNA – LNP vaccine can be easily transported to all parts of the world without cooling or freezing . How - ever , these products have not been approved for marketing at present , and most of them are in the laboratory research stage . Studies have shown that the mRNA – LNP platform can also retain its stability by freeze - drying [ 129 ] . Muramatsu et al . inspected the stability of mRNA – LNPs by lyophilization at − 80 ◦ C , − 20 ◦ C , 4 ◦ C , 25 ◦ C , and 42 ◦ C , respectively . It was observed that the product could be stored at room temperature for 12 weeks and stored at 4 ◦ C for 24 weeks . The physical and chemical properties of each component did not change signiﬁcantly [ 130 ] . However , with the increase in the storage temperature , mRNA degradation was more obvious . It is worth noting that the freeze - dried mRNA vaccine for CMV infection independently developed by Moderna has entered the phase III clinical stage , and the therapeutic effect is remarkable . Therefore , lyophilization will be one of the important development methods used to improve the stability of mRNA – LNP vaccines in the future . 4 . Conclusions The landscape of treatment , diagnostics , and vaccines for COVID - 19 is advancing at an alarming rate with promising results . mRNA vaccines have obvious advantages when dealing with virus mutations at a high efﬁciency , rapidly , and safely due to the short period of time required from the performing the design sequence to the clinical trial . The mRNA vaccine has played a pivotal role in helping humans to develop immunity against COVID - 19 and in preventing the spread of the virus . It is worth emphasizing that LNPs have various advantages over other carriers , including the protection of mRNA against degradation , co - delivery with adjuvants , and the ease of simple synthesis . At present , researchers have conducted in - depth research on LNPs using lipid carriers to deliver drugs , and have gained considerable experience in raw material control , process development , carrier - quality standards , and safety evaluation . Effective LNP - delivery technology is not only critical for the development of new mRNA vaccines , but also has the potential to deliver mRNA , gene , and CRISPR gene - editing therapies . DDSs mediated by LNPs , LPNs , lipoplexes , or LLPs is a ﬁeld that is clearly progressing . It is expected that very soon new formulations will achieve clinical trials or enter the market of transfection reagents , especially in clinical applications . Although mRNA – LNP vaccines are being developed at an unprecedented rate , some problems and challenges remain . The main challenges faced by mRNA – LNP vaccines are as follows : ( i ) large - scale production ; ( ii ) ultra - low - temperature transportation and storage of vaccines ; ( iii ) the delivery efﬁcacy of mRNA ; and ( IV ) strong immunogenicity , triggering an unnecessary immune response . The cellular uptake and endosomal escape of mRNA were enhanced by the rational lipid design [ 131 – 133 ] . However , it remains unclear how the ionizable cationic lipids in LNPs interact with mRNAs . Additionally , more research is required to conﬁrm the internal structure of LNPs . Due to the instability of mRNA , the identiﬁcation of impurities that may disrupt mRNA translation and negatively impact the activity of LNP - formulated mRNA products are prevalent . Furthermore , these impurities make it difﬁcult to assess mRNA integrity in mRNA – LNPs using conventional techniques , such as CE . RP - IP HPLC provides speciﬁcity and sensitivity for detecting lipid – mRNA adducts [ 134 ] . The study of the interaction mechanism between LNPs and mRNA , improving the detection means of lipid – mRNA adducts , will play a critical role in improving the quality of mRNA – LNP vaccines . mRNA is sensitive and easily degradable , requiring the use of ultra - low - temperature cold chains to ship COVID - 19 vaccines around the world . Because cold - chain transportation Polymers 2022 , 14 , 4195 14 of 19 is not available in many areas affected by COVID - 19 , a vaccine that can be stored at room temperature is highly desirable . Consequently , the major problem that , at present , needs to be resolved is the low stability and easy degradation of mRNA molecules . The good quality of mRNA vaccines relies on optimizing stability and delivery systems , which can be approached by rational molecular designs . Certainly , suitable additives and excipients can be selected to achieve transport stability at higher temperatures . In addition to alternative lipids and excipients , other formulation techniques , such as lyophilization , can be utilized to achieve better stability . The emergence of variants of COVID - 19 due to evolution and adaptation processes may encourage greater demands for the development of mRNA – LNP vaccines . The key to next - generation mRNA vaccine development is LNP and genome editing . In the future , mRNA – LNP vaccines may enable the adjustment of antigen designs and even permit the combining of sequences from several variants to respond to new mutations of the COVID - 19 genome . The research reported a circular RNA ( circRNA ) vaccine that elicited potent neutralizing antibodies and T - cell responses by expressing the RBD of the spike protein , providing effective protection against SARS - CoV - 2 in both mice and rhesus macaques [ 135 ] . New delivery system discoveries should help to meet the quality requirements that demand a balance between effectiveness , toxicity , and technology , aiming for market approval . In summary , an excellent mRNA – LNP vaccine requires professional knowledge , a complete production system , and related technical teams from the selection and design of antigens , the selection of vectors , the preparation of samples , and the stable storage of vaccines . The ameliorated delivery efﬁciency of LNPs and their reduced toxicity , the optimized effective delivery of the carrier for mRNA , and the improved storage conditions of the product will be the subjects of our research in the future .
