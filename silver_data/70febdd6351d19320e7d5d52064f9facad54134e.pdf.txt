Despite our incomplete understanding of the mechanisms that control these divergent functions , immune - based therapies are becoming a therapeutic focus . This review will address the complexities and controversies of post - traumatic neuroinflammation , particularly in spinal cord . In addition , current therapies designed to target neuroinflammatory cascades will be discussed . Keywords macrophages ; lymphocytes ; neuroinflammation ; spinal cord injury ; traumatic brain injury ; blood - brain barrier Introduction Central nervous system ( CNS ) trauma , either in the form of traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) or spinal cord injury ( SCI ) , causes marked neuropathology and limited functional recovery . While mechanical trauma rapidly kills neurons and glia , an insidious and delayed secondary pathology follows . The latter may be amenable to therapy and is characterized by neuronal and glial apoptosis , increased blood - CNS barrier permeability and a complex and poorly understood neuroinflammatory response that can persist for months or years after the initial trauma ( 44 ; 122 ; 140 ) . The role of neuroinflammation is controversial . Both beneficial and detrimental effects have been ascribed to microglia / macrophages ( CNS macrophages ) , lymphocytes , antibodies and cytokines . The goal of this review is to address the complexities and controversies of this response with an emphasis on SCI . In addition , we will discuss pre - clinical and clinical therapies that target neuroinflammation , addressing those that suppress or enhance the immune response . Corresponding Author : Phillip G .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Traumatically - injured brain and spinal cord elicit distinct neuroinflammatory reactions Although inflammation is a ubiquitous consequence of CNS trauma , the temporal sequence , composition and magnitude of this response in brain are distinct from spinal cord . Schnell and colleagues proved this point by comparing the inflammatory responses elicited by identical injuries delivered to mouse brain and spinal cord ( 147 ) . Following a parasagittal incision to the cortex or a similar incision to the dorsal spinal cord , marked differences in cellular inflammation were observed . In the brain , neutrophil infiltration was minimal and was restricted to the lesion site . In contrast , twice as many neutrophils infiltrated the spinal cord lesion within 24 hours with large numbers of cells infiltrating into the surrounding parenchyma . Similarly , activation and recruitment of CNS macrophages was attenuated and restricted in distribution after brain injury relative to SCI . Lymphocyte numbers also were 2 – 3 times greater in the spinal cord with increased infiltration into surrounding tissue . Similar changes were noted when neuroinflammation was elicited by non - traumatic microinjection of IL - 1 β or TNF α ( 148 ) . In response to these cytokines , the recruitment of neutrophils and CNS macrophages was always greater in spinal cord . Following IL - 1 β microinjection , lymphocytes infiltrated the spinal cord but never the brain . TNF α microinjections into brain elicited a response comprised only of CNS macrophages while identical injections into spinal cord elicited neutrophils and macrophages . Molecular and anatomical differences between brain and spinal cord may explain the regional differences in leukocyte recruitment ( 170 ; 171 ) . Microvascular injury and serum extravasation in the inflamed spinal cord is increased in magnitude and duration relative to the brain ( 54 ; 147 ) and is more susceptible to the permeabilizing effects of cytokines ( 148 ) . Unique patterns of chemokine expression may also explain differential leukocyte recruitment . Specifically , neutrophil - attracting chemokines ( e . g . , CINC ) are up - regulated to a greater extent in the injured spinal cord than in the brain ( 27 ) . There is a tendency for researchers to categorically lump mechanisms of brain and spinal cord neuroinflammation together ; however , it is becoming clear that the spinal cord should not be considered simply an extension of the brain . Given the pivotal role played by immune cells in orchestrating cellular and molecular cascades of tissue injury and repair , future studies should explore the extent to which brain and spinal cord inflammation differ and define the mechanisms responsible for these differences . By doing so , novel site - specific therapies should be possible . Species and strain - dependent differences in the neuroinflammatory response to spinal cord injury Neuroinflammatory responses to SCI vary between species and strains of a given species . These differences are unlikely to be due to variable degrees of primary trauma between small and large animals . Spinal contusion and compression injury cause acute central hemorrhagic necrosis in all mammals and are accompanied by prominent glial activation and leukocyte infiltration ( see Fig . 1B ) ( 44 ; 63 ; 136 ; 159 ) . However , the onset , duration and composition of infiltrating leukocytes is distinct between humans and rodents , between rodent species ( rat vs . mouse ) and between different rat and mouse strains ( 44 ; 81 ; 136 ; 159 ) . In all species , neutrophils accumulate within the lesion over the course of hours to days then , in most species , are rapidly cleared during the first week post - injury . In mice , elevated numbers of neutrophils persist in the lesion for months ( 81 ) . In rats , lymphocytes infiltrate the lesion with monocytes 3 – 7 days post - injury . In contrast , lymphocyte entry is delayed in humans and mice with peak numbers evident after a delay of months post - injury ( 81 ; 159 ) . Unique to mice Donnelly and Popovich Page 2 Exp Neurol .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t is the formation of a dense connective tissue matrix in the lesion in parallel with lymphocyte accumulation ( 44 ; 81 ; 136 ; 159 ) . It is clear that genetics are an important determinant of post - traumatic neuroinflammation . After SCI , the MRL and 129X1 / SvJ mouse strains mount a diminutive neuroinflammatory response that is associated with enhanced tissue repair and endogenous axonal plasticity ( 34 ; 99 ) . In contrast , dense fibrosis accompanies a robust inflammatory response in C57BL / 6 mice but without significant axonal growth ( 81 ; 99 ) . A detailed comparative analysis in four common strains of mice after SCI failed to reveal a strict correlation between neuroinflammation , functional recovery and lesion pathology ( 81 ) . Strain differences also extend to SCI rats , with increased numbers of leukocytes found in Lewis rats compared to Sprague - Dawley rats ( 136 ) . The extended time course of macrophage accumulation in Lewis rats has also been described after optic nerve crush injury ( 154 ) . These strain differences underscore the fact that within a genetically heterogeneous human population , attempts to manipulate inflammation to promote repair or minimize secondary injury will undoubtedly yield variable results . As diverse strains and species will continue to be used to extrapolate the human condition , future studies need to define how leukocyte populations vary between strains / species in the context of outcomes that are relevant to CNS repair . For example , do macrophages from C57BL / 6 and MRL mouse strains release similar quantities of axon growth promoting proteins ? Should the inflammatory contributions to remyelination be studied in BALB / c mice where post - injury inflammation is minimal relative to most other strains ? Changes in microvascular permeability after CNS injury : relationship to intraparenchymal inflammation A prelude to the inflammatory response elicited by CNS trauma , and perhaps a consequence of this response at later times post - injury , is an increase in blood - brain barrier permeability ( see Fig . 1E ) ( 54 ; 106 ; 120 ; 133 ; 136 ; 147 ; 179 ) . Using a rat model of spinal contusion injury , Noble and Wrathall initially described injury - induced changes in permeability to horseradish peroxidase ( HRP ) ( 120 ) . They found that HRP extravasation correlated with injury severity ; mild injury resulted in focal extravasation in spinal gray matter while severe injury involved gray and white matter . HRP extravasation was maximal within 1 day , with closure of the barrier by 14 days . Whetstone et al . described similar changes in acute permeability in SCI mice with a secondary rise in permeability 3 – 7 days post - injury ( 179 ) . Interestingly , this secondary change parallels a time when blood monocytes infiltrate the injured spinal cord . A correlation between microglia activation and changes in microvascular permeability has been described in spinal cord white matter in SCI rats ( 133 ) . While mechanical forces contribute to initial disruption of the blood - brain barrier , inflammatory mediators undoubtedly influence later changes in endothelial function , including maintenance of blood - to - tissue transfer . The proinflammatory cytokines TNF α and IL - 1 β , which are up - regulated immediately after injury ( see below and Fig . 1C ) , can enhance vascular permeability ( 148 ) . A number of other vasoactive substances released by glia and leukocytes , including reactive oxygen species , kinins , histamines , nitric oxide and elastase , may also play a role ( 4 ; 25 ; 28 ; 40 ; 113 ; 146 ; 172 ) . Furthermore , matrix metalloproteinase ( MMP ) - 9 , which is produced by neutrophils and endothelia , facilitates leukocyte diapedesis and may be a vascular permeabilizing factor ( 106 ) . These data indicate that pathological alterations in blood - brain barrier function may be regulated by manipulating inflammatory cells and their release products . Alternatively , if properly controlled , these vasoactive properties of neuroinflammation could be harnessed to facilitate delivery of drugs to the chronically injured brain or spinal cord .

N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t Immune - mediated injury in the traumatically injured CNS Neutrophils and macrophages Via the release of cytokines , free radicals , eicosanoids and proteases , activated neutrophils and macrophages can cause neuronal and glial toxicity ( see Fig . 1A ) ( 9 ; 22 ; 29 ; 31 ; 97 ; 109 ; 117 ; 155 ) . This toxic potential has been demonstrated repeatedly in various models of SCI . Protocols to deplete or neutralize neutrophils and macrophages or inhibit their functions , have provided consistent neuroprotection and improved neurological recovery ( 15 ; 19 ; 41 ; 49 ; 50 ; 52 ; 119 ; 131 ; 166 ) . Neurons and glia synthesize pro - inflammatory cytokines ( e . g . , TNF α and IL - 1 β ) as part of normal intercellular communication ( 69 ; 139 ) . However , sustained elevations of TNF α and IL - 1 β evoke inflammation and dysregulate cytokine release causing neuron and oligodendrocyte death ( see Fig . 1C ) ( 26 ; 66 ; 91 ; 98 ; 155 ) . Blocking TNF α or IL - 1 β confers neuroprotection in models of SCI , TBI and stroke ( 48 ; 116 ; 145 ; 156 ) . IL - 6 and LIF also have been implicated in secondary neurodegeneration after CNS injury ( see Fig . 1C ) ( 77 ; 89 ; 100 ; 124 ) . Over - expression of IL - 6 or LIF in spinal cord enhances leukocyte infiltration , decreases axonal growth and impairs locomotor recovery ( 89 ) . Clearly , cytokines are important for maintaining homeostasis in the CNS but after injury they can become pathological . Oxidative stress , caused by ischemia - reperfusion and inflammatory byproducts , contributes to cell death cascades after traumatic and ischemic CNS injury ( 5 ; 57 ; 94 ; 157 ; 180 ; 183 ) . Neutrophils , microglia and macrophages produce superoxide anion and nitric oxide which combine to form the highly reactive and toxic compound peroxynitrite ( 32 ; 36 ; 96 ; 102 ; 177 ; 180 ) . Free radicals produced during these processes induce apoptosis in neurons and glia via the irreversible oxidation of proteins , lipids and nucleic acids ( 42 ; 92 ; 95 ; 109 ; 180 ) . Glutamate is the chief excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS ; however , excess glutamate causes excitotoxicity in gray and white matter ( 33 ; 93 ; 107 ; 123 ) . Normally , glutamate is cleared from the extracellular space by astrocytes and to a limited degree by microglia ( 105 ; 144 ; 174 ) . After injury , glutamate metabolism by astrocytes is impaired and clearance is inhibited further by TNF α and IL - 1 β ( 30 ; 130 ; 164 ) , reactive oxygen species ( 128 ; 175 ) and arachidonic acid ( 187 ) . Activated microglia and macrophages are also likely to increase glutamate levels in the extracellular cleft ( 121 ; 126 ; 127 ) . These latter changes in glutamate may be undetectable via conventional detection systems ( e . g . , microdialysis ) but could still sensitize neurons to the effects of other substances in the microenvironment . Indeed , a feed - forward mechanism of glutamate excitotoxicity is feasible given that pro - inflammatory cytokines ( e . g . , TNF α ) modulate the expression of synaptic AMPA and GABA receptors rendering neurons more susceptible to excitotoxicity ( 13 ; 160 ) . Activated neutrophils and macrophages also produce neurotoxic enzymes . Phospholipase A2 , a key enzyme in eicosanoid synthesis , is up - regulated in microglia , neurons and oligodendrocytes ( 97 ) . Arachidonic acid and eicosanoids can be neurotoxic due to their ability to promote cyclooxygenase and free radical synthesis and by enhancing vascular permeability and leukocyte influx ( 3 ; 38 ; 76 ; 88 ; 103 ; 173 ) . Extracellular matrix - degrading enzymes ( e . g . , MMPs ) produced by neutrophils , macrophages and endothelia also have been implicated in secondary injury ( 44 ; 119 ; 178 ; 186 ) . Lymphocytes Like microglia and macrophages , activated lymphocytes have conflicting effects on the injured CNS . Decades of experimental and clinical research in multiple sclerosis have shown the pathological potential of neuroantigen - reactive T and B lymphocytes , mostly those that recognize and mount reactions against myelin proteins ( e . g . , myelin basic protein ; MBP ) Donnelly and Popovich Page 4 Exp Neurol . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2009 June 8 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t ( 47 ; 55 ; 65 ; 68 ; 161 ; 176 ) . These autoimmune responses amplify CNS macrophage effector functions resulting in blood - brain barrier injury and toxicity to oligodendrocytes and neurons ( 14 ; 149 ; 158 ) . The result is widespread edema , axonal injury and loss of function ( see Fig . 1A ) . The notion that traumatic or ischemic CNS injury can trigger pathological autoimmunity is a relatively new concept ( 1 ; 135 ) . Still , a growing body of evidence in animal models and human SCI has confirmed this potential ( 43 ; 51 ; 74 ; 82 ) . Using transgenic mice and rats vaccinated to expand MBP - reactive T cells , we have shown that autoimmune reactions exacerbate demyelination and axonal pathology , effectively increasing the size of the contusion lesion and causing loss of supraspinal neurons ( 73 ; 74 ) . This destructive potential is not restricted to MBP - reactive cells or SCI as T cells reactive with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein ( MOG ) or ovalbumin ( OVA ; a non - CNS protein ) exacerbate neuron loss in a model of peripheral nerve injury ( 2 ) . The fact that OVA immunizations increased neuropathology indicates that T cells need not be myelin - reactive to contribute to secondary neurodegeneration . Indeed , mice and rats without T - lymphocytes ( RAG knockout and athymic nude rats ) have attenuated neuropathology after TBI and SCI ( 43 ; 137 ) . Also , antibody - mediated blockade of lymphocyte chemokines inhibits T cell infiltration and attenuates secondary injury after SCI ( 51 ) . Implicit to most T cell reactions is parallel activation of B cells and antibody secretion . Evidence that B cells are activated after SCI is implied from clinical data showing elevated levels of CNS autoantibodies in the serum of individuals with chronic SCI ( 64 ) . We recently confirmed this potential in a mouse model of spinal contusion injury showing that SCI induces the production of autoantibodies directed against CNS proteins and systemic antigens including DNA ( 1 ) . Interestingly , anti - DNA antibodies can cross - react with glutamate receptors ( 37 ) . If these cross - reactive anti - DNA antibodies are pathological , then B cell - mediated pathology may transcend the spinal cord . Indeed , in systemic lupus erythematosus , anti - DNA antibodies cause cognitive deficits and widespread organ pathology . These latter parameters are not usually considered in paraplegic or quadriplegic individuals ; however , SCI autoantibodies injected into intact hippocampi induced neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis ( 1 ) . Immune cell - mediated neuroprotection and regeneration Neutrophils and macrophages Given their primary function as bactericidal cells , it is doubtful that neutrophils exert neuroprotection in the CNS . This is not true for CNS macrophages . Despite being adept killers of neurons and glia , microglia may be intrinsically neuroprotective ; they regularly survey the CNS and provide trophic support to neurons and glia ( 6 ; 87 ; 118 ) . Indeed , it makes little sense to have evolved a homogeneously distributed network of cells capable of destroying the CNS from within . Instead , both microglia and macrophages derived from infiltrating monocytes produce neuroprotective cytokines and growth factors ( see Fig . 1D ) . For example , TGF β 1 produced by macrophages after injury ( 90 ; 108 ) has beneficial effects on neurons ( 79 ) and limits oligodendrocyte toxicity ( 110 ) . Classical neurotrophic factors including CNTF , IGF , HGF , PDGF , NGF , BDNF , GDNF and NT - 3 also are synthesized and released by activated CNS macrophages ( 39 ; 60 ; 78 ; 83 ; 114 ; 115 ) . CNS macrophages may protect and repair the injured CNS by modulating glutamate excitotoxicity and by promoting the growth of injured axons ( see Fig . 1A ) . Better known for their ability to release glutamate , microglia and macrophages increase transporters that are able to take up extracellular glutamate ( 144 ; 174 ) . Several lines of evidence suggest that CNS macrophages can promote axon growth and perhaps long - distance regeneration . Arguably the most convincing of the recent data illustrating this potential was described in a model of optic nerve injury . In that study , a novel protein called oncomodulin ( OM ) , released by activated macrophages , was shown to be responsible for promoting regeneration of injured retinal ganglion cells ( 185 ) . Interestingly , the same mode of macrophage activation that produces OM , Donnelly and Popovich Page 5 Exp Neurol . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2009 June 8 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t causes the release of neurotoxic molecules ( 184 ) . Thus , even though macrophages can promote axon regeneration , the potential for causing simultaneous injury exists . This will make it difficult to exploit CNS macrophage functions as a therapy in any form of CNS injury . Still , the rapid and enduring turnover of CNS macrophages from bone marrow makes it hard to ignore the possibility that these cells could be genetically - modified ex vivo and act as vehicles for drug delivery ( 17 ) . Lymphocytes Although there is overwhelming evidence that lymphocytes can initiate and exacerbate injury to neurons and glia , recent data show that B and T cells may be an important and perhaps necessary component of CNS repair . Indeed , B and T cells can secrete a bioactive form of the neurotrophin BDNF ( 78 ) . Moreover , Schwartz and colleagues have championed the idea of “protective autoimmunity” stating that autoreactive T cells , specifically those responding to myelin proteins , are an advantageous but inefficient response to CNS injury ( 151 ; 152 ) . As a result , they propose therapeutic vaccines to treat neurological disorders including SCI , TBI , glaucoma , and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( 150 ) . Although this notion is in conflict with the prevailing dogma that autoreactive T cells are neurodestructive , the Schwartz laboratory has shown that passive or active MBP immunization limits secondary neurodegeneration in injured spinal cord and optic nerve ( 45 ; 61 ; 111 ) . This neuroprotection is attributed to the expression of neurotrophins and antithrombin III by MBP - specific T cells ( see Fig . 1D ) ( 45 ) . Because these protective effects are not evident in all rat or mouse strains , the application of therapeutic vaccines in humans will require a better understanding of how genetics influences autoimmunity ( 62 ; 85 ) . B cells also can exert beneficial effects in the traumatized CNS . In addition to providing neurotrophic factors , autoantibodies specific for myelin protein can promote axon regeneration and improve locomotor recovery after SCI ( 70 ) . Protective autoimmunity , as defined by Schwartz et al . , requires proinflammatory myelin - reactive T cells ( 84 ) . However , other investigators have suggested that neuroprotection is conferred by T cells that are not CNS - reactive after central and peripheral nerve injury ( 58 ; 75 ; 153 ) . Importantly , these latter cells are activated along with T cells specific for MBP ( 112 ) . Clearly , our understanding of lymphocyte functions in the injured nervous system is incomplete . Immunomodulatory and cell - specific therapies for SCI Methylprednisolone ( MP ) , a potent immunosuppressive glucocorticoid , can successfully suppress various indices of neuroinflammation in experimental SCI models ( 10 ; 46 ; 181 ; 182 ) . Although MP is the current standard of care for human SCI , the effectiveness and safety of this drug have recently been questioned ( 35 ; 71 ; 141 ) . Because immune responses in the CNS can have dual effects , global immune suppression is unlikely to yield long - term benefits . Instead , optimal treatments should be tailored to augment the beneficial functions of neuroinflammation while simultaneously minimizing those that cause injury . Currently , an immunomodulatory therapy of this type does not exist . However , a number of promising pre - clinical studies and clinical trials have been completed illustrating the therapeutic potential of cell - specific therapies after SCI . Several groups have confirmed the therapeutic potential of activated microglia and monocyte - derived macrophages in the injured spinal cord ( 21 ; 138 ; 142 ; 143 ) . Two studies revealed that microglial transplants placed into lesioned spinal cord promoted neurite growth ( 138 ; 142 ) . Although functional recovery was not documented in these latter reports , partial recovery was provided by transplanting activated monocytes into the caudal stump of transected rat spinal cord ( 143 ) . The success of these pre - clinical models prompted a Phase I clinical trial . This trial was completed without any adverse effects associated with macrophage transplantation ( 86 ) . Donnelly and Popovich Page 6 Exp Neurol . Author manuscript ; available in PMC 2009 June 8 . N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t N I H - PA A u t ho r M anu sc r i p t For more information about this trial and its implications , readers are directed to a recent review ( 80 ) . Other studies have illustrated the neuroprotective capacity of acute macrophage depletion . Indeed , studies in various species and models of SCI have independently verified that secondary loss of neurons ( axons ) and myelin is reduced after inhibition of monocyte , and in some cases , neutrophil , infiltration . This has been accomplished using macrophage - specific toxins ( 19 ; 131 ) , antibody - mediated blockade of integrins ( 7 ; 8 ; 52 ; 101 ) , chemokine antagonists ( 41 ) and pharmacological agents that inhibit microglia and / or monocyte migration and secretion ( 20 ; 49 ) . More importantly , these anatomical indices of recovery were paralleled by significant but variable improvements in motor , sensory and autonomic function . Despite the pre - clinical success of therapeutic CNS vaccines , the safety of intentionally expanding autoreactive lymphocytes to repair the injured spinal cord remains questionable ( 134 ) . Although , this type of therapy has been applied in humans with Alzheimer’s disease with some evidence of efficacy ( 12 ; 53 ; 104 ; 168 ) , Phase II trials were suspended due to the onset of autoimmune meningoencephalitis in a small cohort of patients ( 18 ; 125 ) . In addition to cell - specific therapies , a number of pharmacotherapies that target the immune - CNS axis have been investigated . Systemic treatment with the anti - inflammatory cytokine IL - 10 limits secondary neurodegeneration and improves locomotor recovery in some but not all SCI rodents ( 16 ; 23 ; 165 ) . Similarly , the antibiotic minocycline , known for its ability to inhibit microglia and macrophages , has been shown to be neuroprotective and reduce neuropathic pain in rat and mouse models of SCI ( 56 ; 162 ; 167 ) . Conclusions Despite extensive experimental data implicating inflammation as a pathogenic component of SCI , inflammation also appears to be pivotal for tissue repair . A challenge for researchers is to learn how to control cross - talk between the nervous and immune systems to minimize delayed neurodegeneration while promoting axonal plasticity and regeneration . Moreover , a greater appreciation for how SCI influences leukocyte development , activation and mobilization within and from peripheral lymphoid tissues is needed . Armed with this new knowledge , more effective and safer immune - based strategies will become available to treat spinal cord trauma and other CNS injuries . Reference List 1 .
