In addition to persistent self - propelled motion , many cells display remarkable adaptive behaviors when they navigate complex environments within the body . Combining theory and experiments , we identify a curvature - sensing mechanism underlying obstacle avoidance in immune - like cells . The genetic perturbation of this machinery leads to a reduced capacity to evade obstructions combined with faster and more persistent cell migration in obstacle - free environments . We propose that the active polymerization of the actin cytoskeleton at the advancing edge of migrating cells is locally inhibited by the curvature - sensitive BAR protein Snx33 in regions with inward plasma membrane curvature . This coupling between actin and membrane dynamics leads to a mechanochemical instability that generates complex protrusive patterns at the cellular front . Adaptive motility thus arises from two simultaneous curvature - dependent effects , i ) the specific reduction of propulsion in regions where external objects deform the plasma membrane and ii ) the intrinsic patterning capacity due to the membrane - actin coupling that promotes spontaneous changes in the cell’s protrusions . Our results show how cells utilize actin - and plasma membrane biophysics to sense their environment , allowing them to adaptively decide if they should move ahead or turn away . On the basis of our findings , we propose that the natural diversity of BAR proteins may allow cells to tune their curvature sensing machinery to match the shape characteristics in their environment . 2 Main text : The self - propelled motion of cells underlies many developmental , physiological , and pathological processes 1 - 3 . Former investigations revealed the rich physics of persistent cellular propulsion , clarifying for example how the non - equilibrium properties of a polar actin network can generate a steadily advancing leading edge 4 - 8 . In addition to persistent motion , migrating cells display remarkable adaptive behaviors . Cells within the body efficiently circumvent obstacles 9 , 10 to navigate complex and dynamic environments 11 but the physical basis of motility adaptation is not well understood . These adaptive behaviors are particularly important for cell types that encounter highly variable environments , such as immune cells and disseminating tumor cells . During migration , the outmost boundary of the cell – the plasma membrane – is deformed by the changing microenvironment . Thus , cells might decode their membrane curvature to decide if they should move ahead or turn away . Many migrating cells indeed express a variety of curvature - sensing proteins , which can directly interact with both the plasma membrane and the subjacent actin cytoskeleton 12 . Here we investigate the role of curvature sensing in adaptive motility . The family of BAR domain - containing proteins could facilitate membrane curvature sensing . These proteins form crescent shaped membrane - binding dimers that can sense and generate curvature 12 - 14 , and are known to interact with regulators of the actin cytoskeleton through several auxiliary domains 12 , 15 . We identified candidates from this large protein family by measuring their expression profile in immune - like HL - 60 cells before and after terminal differentiation , where they undergo substantial changes in gene expression and initiate rapid migration , resembling what occurs in the bone marrow in vivo 16 ( Fig . 1a , b , Supplementary Fig . 1a ) . The BAR domain protein Snx33 was 16 - fold over - expressed in the curvature - rich state ( Supplementary Fig . 1b ) . Based on its structure , Snx33 likely prefers comparatively small , positive ( inward ) curvatures ( Fig . 1c , Supplementary Fig . 2a - d ) 12 . We imaged its subcellular localization by confocal microscopy after fluorescent tagging and found that Snx33 is enriched in distinct membrane ruffles at the leading edge of these cells ( Fig . 1d , e ) . To address the role of curvature sensing in adaptive migration , we generated cells lacking Snx33 ( Snx33 - / - ) using CRISPR / Cas9 genome editing ( Supplementary Fig . 3a , b ) , and first assessed cell - scale migratory behavior . We positioned the cells in microfluidic devices 17 , 18 where they migrated through channels with branching points with multiple differently sized pores . Snx33 - / - cells required significantly more time than their wild - type counterparts to navigate these decision - points and find the path of least resistance ( Fig . 1f , Supplementary Fig . 4a , b ) . However , in decision - free channels with or without a single constriction , Snx33 - / - cells migrated faster than their wildtype counterparts ( Fig . 1g , Supplementary Fig . 4c ) . Next , we quantified unconfined migration on planar substrates . We trained and used machine learning - based algorithms in ilastik 19 to analyze movies of cells imaged by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( TIRFM ) ( Fig . 1h , see Methods for details ) . Similar as in decision - free channels , Snx33 - / - cells migrated faster than wildtype cells ( Fig . 1i ) . Moreover , while the motility of Snx33 - / - cells was more persistent , wild - type cells were more prone to perform large spontaneous turns ( Fig . 1j ) . Thus , the loss of Snx33 appears to render cells less effective in navigating a branching point , while more persistent in a decision - free environment , suggesting they have improved propulsion but lack the ability to adapt when faced with an inert obstacle . Propulsion in immune - like cells depends on the active polymerization of actin at the leading edge of the cell 20 , 21 . Given that cell shape reflects changes in actin - rich protrusions 22 , we performed a quantitative and unbiased comparison of selected cell morphometric parameters , i . e . , cell spreading , cell eccentricity and leading edge characteristics during decision - free migration on a planar substrate . As immune cells radically change their morphology in short periods of time , we averaged time - lapse movies to capture their dynamics . Snx33 - / - cells spread to a larger extent , showed a more elongated morphology and bigger leading edge ( Fig . 2a - f , Supplementary Fig . 5a - e ) ; migration phenotypes that 3 were independent of cell adhesion to the substrate ( Supplementary Fig . 5f - h ) . Moreover , we measured the static tether pulling force of the plasma membrane with atomic force microscopy , and observed an increase from 61 . 58 pN for wildtype to 75 . 25 pN in Snx33 - / - cells ( which corresponds with an increase in membrane tension from 177 . 87 to 265 . 62 uN / m ; see Methods for details ; Supplementary Fig . 6a , b ) . Expressing fluorescently - tagged Snx33 reversed these changes in the morphology and mechanics of the leading edge thereby proving the specificity of the observed phenotypes ( Supplementary Fig . 5b , c and Supplementary Fig . 6b , c and d ) . Notably , these phenotypes were not a consequence of defective differentiation , as the neutrophil differentiation marker CD11b was unperturbed in Snx33 - / - cells ( Supplementary Fig . 6e ) . Altogether , the observation that Snx33 - / - cells have larger actin protrusions and higher membrane tension during decision - free migration indicates that deficient curvature sensing triggers an increase in actin polymerization at the leading edge even in the absence of obstacles . These findings suggest that Snx33 mediates an intrinsic coupling between actin organization and membrane curvature . Such feedback effects have been proposed to trigger mechanochemical instabilities 23 , 24 indicative of an intrinsic patterning capacity . Motile cells often feature wave - like patterns of actin activity and plasma membrane ruffles at their leading edge 20 , 21 , 25 as observed by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) and polarized total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( p - TIRFM ) , ( Fig . 2g , h and Supplementary Fig . 7a , b ) . To link the dynamic membrane - actin patterns to the putative curvature - sensing function of Snx33 , we analyzed the mechanochemical instability arising from a corresponding coupling between actin - dependent force generation and membrane curvature with a minimal set of equations and parameters ( Fig . 2i - k and Supplementary Note ) . We considered a Helfrich membrane with a bending rigidity κ and surface tension γ 26 , 27 subject to an active pressure field due to actin polymerization . For the simplified case of a 1D pattern on a periodic domain x , we obtain the following equation for the membrane curvature C % λ ' ∂ ' ∂x ' − 1 + C = − f . γ A , 1 in which λ = 1κ / γ is the membrane persistence length , A is the concentration field of a generic activator of actin polymerization , and f . is the force per activator molecule . The activator concentration is taken to evolve according to a reaction - diffusion equation , in which we consider self - activation of A 20 on a timescale τ A and a curvature - dependent regulatory term r 5 ( C ) τ A ∂ ∂t A = A + r 5 ( C ) + λ A2 ∂ ' ∂x ' A , 2 in which λ A = 1τ A D is a reaction - diffusion length scale with diffusion coefficient D . For regulation in the regime of small curvatures , the second reaction term can be truncated beyond linear order and written as r 5 ( C ) = ξ γ / f . C with a dimensionless coupling constant ξ . Linear stability analysis of Eqs . 1 - 2 then yields the dispersion relation for the growth rate ω ( k ) of the perturbation mode with wavenumber k ω ( k ) = 1 τ A A1 − k ' λ . ' + ξ 1 + k ' λ ' B . 3 The parameter region in which spontaneous patterning occurs ( where ω Max > 0 with k Max > 0 ) is shown in Fig . 2j . Spontaneous patterns emerge in this system only when there is a negative coupling between curvature and actin activity , such that actin polymerization decreases in regions of inward ( positive ) plasma membrane curvature ( Fig . 2g , h and i ) , distinct from previously considered scenarios with curved activators 28 - 30 . Thus , we find that the local down - regulation of actin polymerization in regions with positive membrane curvature can generate mechanochemical patterns at the leading edge of migrating cells ( Fig . 2g , h and Supplementary Fig . 7a , b ) . 4 This theoretical result agrees with the likely binding preference of Snx33 to membrane regions with small positive curvatures ( Supplementary Fig . 2a - d ) and is compatible with the observation that actin polymerization appears increased in Snx33 - / - cells ( Fig . 2d , e , Supplementary Fig . 5c , Supplementary Fig . 6b ) . But how does Snx33 inhibit actin polymerization ? Several BAR domain proteins , including Snx33 , directly bind and regulate the activity of actin nucleator promoting factors from the WASP family 12 , 31 . WAVE2 is the main member of this family in neutrophils and earned its name because it localizes in a wave pattern during cell migration 20 . What regulates WAVE2 binding to the membrane , and whether and how that determines ruffle topography remains poorly understood 32 . Our analysis of the mechanochemical feedback between membrane curvature and an actin activator such as WAVE2 ( Eqs . 1 - 2 ) suggests that the dominant wavelength of the pattern should increase in response to a decrease in the magnitude of the curvature coupling coefficient ξ ( Fig . 3a ) . To test this prediction , we imaged WAVE2 patterns in Snx33 - / - and wild - type cells during migration by TIRFM ( Fig . 3b - d ) . Snx33 - / - cells showed an increase in both the length and the width of WAVE2 patches ( Fig . 3e , Supplementary Fig . 7c , d ) . A mechanochemical curvature coupling would furthermore imply that the change in WAVE2 patch morphology should accompany a longer wavelength of the curved ruffles on the plasma membrane ( Fig . 3a ) . To test this , we quantified the effective ruffle wavelength from SEM images and indeed observed a significantly less tight arrangement of ruffles for Snx33 - / - cells when compared with their wild - type counterparts ( Fig . 3f , g , Supplementary Fig . 7e , f ) . Notably , to date , only very drastic WAVE2 patch phenotypes have been reported ( complete abrogation or increase in number ) , which lead to a severely disrupted morphology and capacity to migrate 33 , 34 . The milder perturbation introduced by the genetic disruption of curvature sensing by Snx33 allowed the identification of the key molecular circuit that couples the active mechanics of the actin network with the biophysics of the membrane to generate complex patterns at the leading edge of migrating cells . This intrinsic patterning capacity can facilitate adaptive motility by reducing persistence and promoting the random evasive maneuvers we observed ( Fig 1j ) . But the particular form of Snx33 - mediated membrane - actin coupling suggests an additional more direct effect , in which propulsion is reduced specifically where the presence of an obstacle in the path of the cell is likely , i . e . where external indentations generate an increased fraction of regions with positive curvature . To gain further insights into the object - avoidance response of Snx33 - deficient cells , we devised a reductionistic assay to investigate how cells steer away from a cellular obstacle , a common phenomenon to many cell types also known as contact inhibition of locomotion ( CIL ) 20 , 35 . We seeded a higher density of cells and imaged their 2D migration in the presence of cell - cell interactions by TIRFM . Snx33 - / - cells collided more often and formed larger cell - cell contacts compared to wild - type cells ( Fig . 4a , b ) . To gain molecular insight into the role of Snx33 in CIL , we simultaneously live - imaged the WAVE2 complex and Snx33 at the leading edge of freely moving cells . While both proteins largely colocalized in most of the cell , they were anticorrelated in the highly negatively ( outward ) curved leading edge ( Supplementary Fig . 8a , b ) . Here , Snx33 levels decreased while WAVE2 accumulated ( Supplementary Fig . 8c , d ) , consistent with Snx33 binding positive curvature and restricting WAVE2 to negatively curved areas . Moreover , when cells collided , Snx33 localized to the cell contact area that is largely devoid of outward curvature , where subsequently WAVE2 disappeared and relocated to contact free zones of the plasma membrane . This resulted in cell repolarization by formation of a new leading edge ( Fig . 4c , d ) . To assess whether the dysfunctional CIL response in Snx33 - / - cells is indeed due to impaired WAVE2 inhibition at the contact area , we followed WAVE2 localization before and after collision in Snx33 - / - cells . In contrast to wildtype cells , Snx33 - / - cells indeed failed to remove WAVE2 from the contact site ( Fig . 4e , Supplementary Fig . 8e ) . Altogether , we show a key role for membrane topography and the curvature sensing protein Snx33 in regulating actin polymerization during CIL . Specifically , Snx33 restricts WAVE to negatively curved areas and thus leads to cell repolarization towards a contact free zone upon collision with an obstacle . 5 Object avoidance is key not only for the migration of immune and cancer cells in complex tissue environments , but also fundamental during embryogenesis and collective migration in vivo 36 . Combining theory , genetic perturbations , microscopy and microfluidics we identified a local mechanochemical circuit underlying adaptive motility in immune - like cells . We show that by coupling plasma membrane curvature with WAVE2 - driven actin polymerization , the curvature sensing protein Snx33 facilitates adaptive motility in two distinct and complementary ways . On the one hand , the mechanochemical feedback between actin and curvature results in an intrinsic patterning capacity which destabilizes the leading edge and reduces migration persistence . The ability to spontaneously reorient and explore the microenvironment with dynamic protrusions in and of itself contributes to more efficient navigation in crowded contexts 17 , 33 , 37 - 40 . On the other hand , while a diverse range of feedback mechanisms can conceivably lead to shape instabilities 41 - 44 , Snx33 implements the coupling between membrane curvature and actin activity in a way that is uniquely suited to aid obstacle avoidance . Locally reducing propulsion in regions of inward curvature specifically steers the cell away from the direction in which the presence of an obstacle on the outside is most likely . Thus , Snx33 and WAVE2 form a non - genetic adaptive circuit that decodes the cell’s local membrane topography and induces a response to decide if it should move ahead or turn away . The machinery we identified morphologically solves the object avoidance problem by exploiting the physics of the materials it is made of , specifically the biophysics of the plasma membrane and the active properties of the subjacent actin network . Given these findings and the diversity of BAR domain proteins present in cells , it is conceivable that on long timescales , cells tune their expression levels to match the curvature statistics of their microenvironment , implying that a cell’s curvature - sensing machinery may itself constitute a structural prediction of its surroundings . 6 Figure 1 : The curvature - sensing protein Snx33 is enriched in membrane waves and its loss impacts adaptive motility . a ) The leading edge of migrating cells is characterized by intricate curvature patterns .

Theoretical calculations Calculations for Fig . 2j and Fig . 3a were performed in Wolfram Mathematica v12 . 1 . 1 . 0 . For the details of the derivations please see the Supplementary Note . Cell migration assays in PDMS - based devices PDMS - based microfluidic devices were prepared as previously described 17 , 54 , 55 . The devices used for migration of dHL - 60 cells had heights of 2 . 8 μ m and 3 . 13 μ m for channels with decision point and channels with constriction , respectively . The decision channels had constrictions of 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 μ m in two arrangements . The channels with single constrictions were 2 μ m . To visualize nuclei and cell body , Hoechst 33342 ( # 62249 , Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and TAMRA ( Invitrogen ) were added before the introduction of cells into the PDMS device . Cell migration towards chemoattractant ( fMLP ) was imaged on an inverted wide - field Nikon Eclipse microscope using 20x / 0 . 5 PH1 air objective , equipped with a Lumencor light source ( 390 nm , 475 nm , 542 / 575 nm ) , an incubation chamber and the heated stage with CO 2 . The acquired data were analyzed using ImageJ software and manually curated . Only single cells that moved through the entire channel were considered for analysis . All the parameters were quantified based on the nuclei signal . Tether extrusion using atomic force spectroscopy Apparent membrane tension was measured by extruding plasma membrane tethers . For measurements , Olympus BioLevers ( k = 60 pN / nm ) from Bruker were mounted on a CellHesion 200 AFM ( Bruker ) , which is integrated into an Eclipse Ti inverted light microscope ( Nikon ) . Cantilevers were calibrated using the thermal noise method and coated with 2 . 5 mg / ml Concanavalin A ( # C5275 , Sigma Aldrich ) . Prior to the measurements , cantilevers were rinsed in dPBS . For tether measurement , the cantilever was position over the cell , preferably over the leading edge . Measurements parameters for static tether pulling experiments were as followed : approach velocity was set to 1 μ m / s , contact force to 100 – 300 pN , contact time to 5 – 10 s , and retraction speed to 10 μ m / s . After a 10 μ m tether was pulled , the cantilever position was held constant until it broke , but no longer than 30 s . In every experimental repetition the conditions’ order was randomized . For every cell at least 3 different tether measurements were taken . The data analysis was performed using the JPK Data Processing Software . For assessing the magnitude of membrane tension based on tether force measurements , the following formula was used 33 : R = S T ' 8VW ' where F 0 is the tether force measured by the AFM and B is the bending rigidity of the plasma membrane , which we assume to be invariable between different experimental conditions ( 2 . 7x10 - 19 Nm based on previous measurements 56 , 57 ) . 20 Image analysis For confocal images , only the z - planes that contained the top 80 % intensity of mCherry - CAAX ( membrane marker ) were considered based on line scans covering the entire resliced maximum intensity z projection . A channel of interest ( ChoF1 ) was used for mask generation based on automatic Otsu segmentation . A custom - made ImageJ script allowed to calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient ( PCC ) for every z - plane of ChoF1 with ChoF2 based on the mask of ChoF1 using the in - built Coloc2 ImageJ plugin . Z - slices were assigned to 10 bins and the mean with standard error of the mean for every bin was calculated . For epifluorescence images , single cells were manually selected using the ImageJ software . To segment the cell body , the contrast of bright - field images was enhanced using the equalize histogram function followed by a canny edge detection , a semi - manual closing of the obtained edges and filling the holes . To segment the leading edge , a similar strategy was used with semi - manual selection of the region with the enriched edges after the canny edge detection with higher values step . Based on the segmentation , a custom Python script was used for measurements . Eccentricity was calculated by ellipse fitting and further division of ellipse foci distance by major axis length . For analysis of migrating cells imaged by TIRFM , a segmentation of the cell mask ( based on mCherry - CAAX signal ) and of the WAVE2 mask ( based on eGFP - Hem1 signal ) were acquired using the machine learning - based ilastik software 19 . Further image analysis was achieved using an in - house built program implemented in Python . The angle at which cells are moving was calculated based on the center of mass for 3 consecutive frames . The leading edge was defined as the difference between two consecutive frames where at least one pixel of WAVE2 mask is present per cluster . Leading edge length was defined as a number of pixels in the outside perimeter of the leading edge . For the analysis of cell - cell contacts the same segmentation strategy was used to segment individual cells . Cell - cell contact was defined as the perimeters’ intersection of both cells . For membrane topography analysis of SEM data , the leading edge area with ruffles was manually segmented on median filtered images . Next , ridges were detected within the segmented regions using the Meijering filter 58 . Ridges were later segmented using automatic Otsu thresholding and skeletonized using a custom Python script . Inversion of the number of pixels within the skeletonization per leading edge area corresponds to the effective the ruffle wavelength . For analysis of signal enrichment at the cell edge based on TIRFM images , data on fluorescent intensity along the line of equal width and length were extracted from both channels of interest ( eGFP - Snx33 , mCherry - Hem1 ) using ImageJ . Data were aligned according to the highest fluorescence intensity of mCherry - Hem1 and normalized . Normalized mean intensity was calculated in both channels of interest for every point along the line scan and plotted using R . Scanning electron microscopy After 30 min of 10 nM fMLP stimulation , cells were fixed in 2 , 5 % GA ( # 16220 , EMS ) in 0 , 1M PHEM buffer by adding 37°C double strength fixative ( 5 % GA in 0 , 1M PHEM ) directly 1 : 1 to the cell medium . After 10 minutes incubation , the fixative was replaced by fresh single strength fixative and cells were further fixed at room temperature for 1h . After fixation , cells were washed 2 times in 0 , 1M PHEM and 2 times in 0 , 1M cacodylate buffer . Next , they were postfixed for 2h on ice in freshly prepared and filtered 1 % OsO 4 ( # 19190 , EMS ) and 0 , 8 % potassium ferrocyanide ( K 4 [ Fe ( CN ) 6 ] * 3H 2 O , # 4984 , Merck ) in 0 , 1M cacodylate buffer . After postfixation , the cells were washed 4 times in H 2 O , and left at 4 ° C until further processing . Next , cells were treated with freshly prepared and filtered 1 % tannic acid ( TA , CAS # 1401 - 55 - 4 , EMS ) in water using a Pelco BioWave microwave for seven 1 - minute cycles alternating between 150 W and 0 W power . Steady temperature was set to 23 ° C and vacuum to on for all steps . After TA treatment , cells were washed 2x in H 2 O on the bench and 2x in H 2 O in the microwave for 40 s per step at 250 W power . Cells were then treated with 1 % UA ( # 77870 , Serva ) in H 2 O using the same microwave program as for TA . After washing once in H 2 O and twice in 25 % EtOH , cells were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol ( 25 % - 50 % - 75 % - 90 % - 100 % - 100 % ) using a microwave program with step length of 40 s and 250 W power , with a steady temperature at 4 ° C and without vacuum . Finally , the cells were infiltrated with a graded series of Hexamethyldisilizane ( HMDS , CAS # 999 - 97 - 3 , Sigma Aldrich ) in ethanol ( 25 % - 50 % - 75 % - 100 % - 100 % ) using a microwave program with 6 steps of 1 minute each , with a power of 150 W for step 1 , 3 , 4 and 6 , and 0 W for steps 2 and 5 . After the final 100 % HMDS infiltration , all HMDS was removed , and coverslips were left to dry overnight . Silica gel with moisture indicator ( Merck ) was added in 4 empty wells ( corners ) in the 24 - well plate to remove excess humidity . 21 After drying , coverslips were mounted in aluminum stubs ( Agar Scientific G301F ) using carbon tape , and sputter coated with a layer of gold for 180 s at 30 mA current using a Quorum sputter coater model Q150RS . Imaging was performed on a Zeiss Crossbean 540 microscope , using 5 kV acceleration voltage and 700 pA current for the electron beam , with a working distance of 5 mm . A secondary electron detector ( SESI ) was used for signal detection , and all images were acquired with a pixel size of 28 , 9 nm / pixel . Statistical analysis Statistical analyses were performed using R , while data visualization by both R and Adobe Illustrator Ò . Normality of data distribution was tested by Shapiro - Wilk test . Two - tailed t - test was used for normal distribution . Otherwise , a non - parametric Mann - Whitney - U - test was used , if not indicated differently . In all box - plots , the lower and upper hinges correspond to the first and third quartiles ( the 25th and 75th percentiles ) . The upper whisker extends from the hinge to the largest value , but no further than 1 . 5 * IQR ( distance between the first and third quartiles ) . The lower whisker extends from the hinge to the smallest value , but no lower than 1 . 5 * IQR of the hinge . Data beyond the end of the whiskers are plotted as black dots . Black line and dot correspond to the median and mean , respectively . 45 . Shalem , O . et al . Genome - scale CRISPR - Cas9 knockout screening in human cells . Science 343 , 84 – 87 ( 2014 ) . 46 .

Supplementary Note : Curvature - dependent mechanochemical patterning Many migrating cells exhibit characteristic patterns of actin activity and membrane curvature at their front [ 1 ] . These have been studied in the past by considering the complex interplay of various actin - regulatory molecules [ 7 , 8 ] . Interactions with the curvature of the plasma membrane have also been investigated , in particular the e   ect of curvature - sensing and inducing proteins that promote the polymerization of actin [ 4 , 5 , 9 – 11 ] . In immune - like HL - 60 cells , the BAR domain containing protein Snx33 is upregulated during migration . Based on its structure , Snx33 is likely to bind membrane regions with weak inward curvatures , and we ﬁnd that disrupting Snx33 im - pacts the cell - scale organization of the actin cytoskeleton . We investigate here a putative role of Snx33 on the patterning capacity of the leading edge . We consider a minimal set of equations to describe the dynamics of mem - brane curvature coupled to the concentration ﬁeld of an activator of actin polymerization . We analyze the mechanochemical instabilities present in the system , and delineate the parameter region in which spontaneous patterning can occur . 1 Main equations In the following , we derive the coupled system of equations consisting of a curvature - dependent reaction - di   usion equation for an activator of actin polymerization , and the equation for the curvature of the membrane . 1 1 . 1 Activator equation We consider the concentration ﬁeld A of a generic activator of actin such as WAVE2 . Because actin protrusions at the cell front are often thin struc - tures with a dense meshwork and an average ﬁlament orientation towards the leading edge [ 13 ] , we neglect variations of A across the thickness of the protrusion and assume that di   usive transport of actin regulatory molecules occurs predominantly in the direction of average ﬁlament alignment x . We consider self - activation of A with a characteristic time constant · A and intro - duce the curvature - dependent regulatory term r C ( C ) . From the continuity equation for the surface concentration of activator molecules , we then obtain the following partial di   erential equation · A ˆ ˆ t A ( x , t ) = A ( x , t ) + r C ( C ( x , t ) ) + ⁄ 2 A ˆ 2 ˆ x 2 A ( x , t ) , ( 1 ) in which ⁄ A = Ô · A D denotes a reaction - di   usion length scale , with D the di   usion coe   cient along the cell migration axis x . 1 . 2 Curvature equation The curvature C depends on the mechanical properties of the plasma mem - brane . We consider a Helfrich membrane without spontaneous curvature with a bending rigidity Ÿ and surface tension “ [ 2 , 6 ] . In the weak bending approximation and with periodic boundary conditions , the conservation of momentum leads to the following equation for the curvature proﬁle along x [ 3 , 12 ] Ÿ ˆ 2 ˆ x 2 C ( x , t ) ≠ “ C ( x , t ) = P , ( 2 ) in which P = P ext ≠ P int denotes the pressure di   erence between the outside and the inside of the cell . We assume that actin polymerization generates an active pressure ﬁeld which acts on the membrane from within the cell that depends on A ( x , t ) , and we neglect any pressure di   erence in the ab - sence of activator molecules . With this term and introducing the membrane persistence length ⁄ = Ò Ÿ / “ , Eq . 2 reads ⁄ 2 ˆ 2 ˆ x 2 C ( x , t ) ≠ C ( x , t ) = ≠ f A “ A ( x , t ) , ( 3 ) in which we denote with f A the force per activator molecule . 2 2 Regulation in the limit of small curvatures Generally , the shape of the regulatory function r C ( C ) is unknown and de - pends on the properties of the curvature - sensing proteins involved . The shape of the dominant BAR protein in our experimental system suggests that cur - vature sensing is relevant in the regime of small curvatures C ( x , t ) = ” C ( x , t ) ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) . Assuming di   erentiability of r C with respect to C , we may write a general expansion of the form r C ( C ) = r C ( 0 ) + d r C d C - - - - C = 0 ” C + O ( ” C 2 ) . ( 4 ) The magnitude of the linear coe   cient depends on the activity of curvature - dependent regulatory proteins . In the following , we assume that no curvature regulation takes place for a completely ﬂat membrane sheet , i . e . r C ( 0 ) = 0 . 3 Patterning regime We now explore the consequences of curvature - regulatory coupling between membrane shape and actin activity by analyzing the stability of the steady state C = 0 and A = 0 , in which the membrane is ﬂat and no actin activ - ity is present . Introducing rescaled variables and the normalized curvature coupling coe   cient a = Af A ⁄ “ , c = ⁄ C ; › = d r C d C - - - - C = 0 f A “ , ( 5 ) we may write Eqs . 1 and 3 in dimensionless form as · A ˆ t a = a + › c + ⁄ 2 A ˆ 2 x a , ( 6 ) 1 ⁄ 2 ˆ 2 x ≠ 1 2 c = ≠ a . ( 7 ) A small perturbation away from the uniform steady state can be written as ” a = ” a 0 exp ( Ê t + i kx ) , ” c = ” c 0 exp ( Ê t + i kx ) , ( 8 ) in which k is the perturbation wavenumber and Ê the corresponding growth rate . Substituting Eq . 8 into Eqs . 6 and 7 and keeping terms to linear order in the perturbation , we obtain the dispersion relation Ê ( k ) = 1 · A A 1 ≠ k 2 ⁄ 2 A + › 1 + k 2 ⁄ 2 B . ( 9 ) 3 The stability diagram as a function of the length scale ratio ⁄ / ⁄ A and the curvature coupling constant › is shown in Fig . 2j . For positive coupling , the growth rate is positive and maximal at k = 0 , describing a uniformly advancing ﬂat sheet in the linearized system . For › < 0 , there is a region in which spontaneous patterning occurs , i . e . where Ê ( k Max ) > 0 with k Max > 0 . Two types of instabilities are present in the system . For ⁄ < ⁄ A , stable and unstable regions are separated by a type - III instability at the critical parameter value › ú III = ≠ 1 , with timescale · A and coherence length Ò ⁄ 2 A ≠ ⁄ 2 . For ⁄ > ⁄ A , the transition between stable and unstable regions corresponds to a type - I instability , and the critical line is given by › ú I = ≠ A ⁄ 2 A + ⁄ 2 2 ⁄ A ⁄ B 2 . ( 10 ) Here , the characteristic timescale is · A 2 ⁄ 2 / ( ⁄ 2 + ⁄ 2 A ) and the coherence length is 2 ⁄⁄ A / ( ⁄ 2 + ⁄ 2 A ) Ò 2 ( ⁄ 2 ≠ ⁄ 2 A ) . The pattern wavelength at the maximum is given by l Max = 2 ﬁ⁄ Ò ≠ i Ô › ⁄⁄ A ≠ 1 ( 11 ) and shown in Fig . 3a . Thus , negative curvature feedback can lead to the spontaneous formation of patterns . The wavelength of the fastest - growing mode increases when the magnitude of the curvature coupling constant › decreases . We note that by coupling the Snx33 - mediated feedback circuit to a sec - ond positive feedback loop , for example driven by a second polymerization - promoting curvature sensing protein species as considered here [ 5 ] , one may recover dynamical behaviors such as traveling waves , which are observed in migrating cells .
