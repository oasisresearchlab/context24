Ishikawa - Ankerhold , and Günther Gerisch Supplemental Experimental Procedures Vector constructs for expression of fluorescently tagged proteins in Dictyostelium The endogenous Dictyostelium proteins fused to green fluorescent protein ( GFP S65T ) , enhanced monomeric red fluorescent protein [ mRFPmars ( 7 ) ] , or DdmCherry are expressed under control of the actin - 15 promoter . Vector constructs for GFP - coronin ( 20 ) , GFP - actin ( S1 ) , GFP - Arp3 ( S2 ) , LimE Δ - GFP ( 4 ) , and mRFPmars - LimE Δ ( 7 ) are based on the Dictyostelium pDEXRH vector , which is stably integrated into the genome ( S3 ) . For DdmCherry , the cDNA sequence encoding mCherry ( S4 ) was adapted to the codon usage of Dictyostelium and synthesized as described ( S5 ) . The DdmCherry sequence contains one amino - acid exchange ( E33K ) compared to the original mCherry . The DdmCherry DNA was cloned into pBsrH - GFP ( S6 ) via Hin dIII and Eco RI by replacing the GFP sequence . Subsequently LimE Δ was cloned into this vector via Eco RI . For construction of the vector encoding GFP - CARMIL , the coding sequence of CARMIL was amplified by PCR using AX2 genomic DNA as template , and was cloned into pBsrH - GFP via Eco RI . GFP - MyoB is encoded by an extrachromosomal vector kindly provided by Margaret Titus , University of Minnesota . Culture conditions and transformation of Dictyostelium cells Cells of Dictyostelium discoideum strains were cultivated at 23 ± 2°C in nutrient medium on polystyrol Petri dishes . If not stated otherwise , AX2 - 214 cells were used for transformation with plasmids enabling the expression of fluorescent fusion proteins . The cells were chilled , washed twice with ice - cold 17 mM K - Na - phosphate buffer , pH 6 . 0 , and electroporated using a Bio - Rad gene pulser at 0 . 8 - 1 . 0 kV and 3 µF with 4 - mm cuvettes . After 24 h , 10 µg of blasticidin - S ( ICN Biomedicals Inc . , Costa Mesa , CA , USA ) or 5 to 20 µg of geneticin ( G418 ; Sigma Corp . ) per ml were added for selection . In the AX2 - derived gene disruption mutant HS2205 lacking myosin - II heavy chains ( 24 ) , mRFP - LimE Δ was expressed using G418 for selection . In the G β - null mutant LW6 and its parent DH1 ( 27 ) , LimE Δ - GFP was expressed using G418 for selection . SCAR - null mutant cells derived from the D . discoideum strain AX3 ( 31 ) were kindly provided by Robert Insall , Beatson Institute for Cancer Research , Glasgow ( UK ) , and transfected to express GFP - Arp3 and Cherry - LimE Δ using for selection G418 or blasticidin , respectively . Transformants were cloned on lawns of E . coli B / 2 , and those showing expression of fluorescent proteins were selected for further analysis . For studying the localization of GFP and mRFP fusion proteins , cells were washed twice in 17 mM K - Na - phosphate buffer , pH 6 . 0 , and were transferred to a glass coverslip in an open chamber . 2 Fluorescent labeling and live - cell imaging To visualize actin waves simultaneously with associated proteins , it was necessary to acquire dual - fluorescence images of high spatial resolution at the sub - second time scale with a minimum of irradiation damage and photobleaching . We have imaged pairs of proteins expressed in the same cells , one tagged with GFP , the other with either mRFP or mCherry . To visualize actin , two probes were applied . GFP - actin ( S1 ) caused a high background due to unpolymerized GFP - actin in the cytoplasm . The lowest background was obtained by labeling the actin filament system with a truncated LimE construct ( LimE Δ ) that lacks the C - terminal coiled - coil domain of the protein ( 4 ) . GFP - tagged MyoB has previously been used to localize this motor protein at the membrane of rocketing phagosomes ( 50 ) . GFP - tagged Arp3 , a subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex , has been used to study recruitment of the complex to leading edges , phagocytic cups , and other dynamic structures of the actin cortex ( 4 , 51 ) . For 3 - D reconstructions , z - stacks were obtained at 200 nm distances using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 microscope equipped with a 100x / 1 . 4 oil Plan Apo objective , a Perkin Elmer Ultra View spinning disc scanner and a Hamamatsu Photonics ORCA - ER , model C4742 - 95 - 12 - ERG camera . GFP and mRFP emissions were separated using alternately a 488 nm / 525 ±50 nm and a 568 nm / 700 ±75 nm filter set . Deconvolution was performed using Huygens Essential from SVI ( Hilversum , The Netherlands ) with the Nipkow Disc Option . The calculation was based on a theoretical point spread function , assuming a refractory index of 1 . 37 for the cytoplasm of Dictyostelium ( S7 ) , combined with maximum likelihood estimation . Images were processed using ImageJ software ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / ) with customized macros and plugins . Dual - color TIRF microscopy For TIRF microscopy a “through - the - objective” setup was employed using standard coverslips and conventional immersion oil . An Olympus 100x / 1 . 45 NA objective on an IX - 71 inverted microscope with a custom built condensor ( VisiTirf , designed in conjunction with Visitron GmbH , 82178 Puchheim , Germany ) was used . For GFP and mRFP , light from an Innova 70C Kr - Ar mixed gas laser ( Coherent , Dieburg Germany ) was passed through an Opto - Electronique AOTF ( supplied by Visitech , Sunderland , UK ) to select and modulate the power of the 488 and 568 nm lines for fluorescent protein excitation . If possible , both GFP and mRFP were excited at 488 nm to insure excitation to the same depth within the sample . For 488 or 491 nm excitation alone the filter cube contained a 488 / 10 laser clean up filter in the excitation position , a z488rdc dichroic , and a 500LP emission filter . For dual excitation at 488 nm and 568 nm the cube contained a 488 / 568 dual laser clean up filter in the excitation position , a 51006bs double bandpass dichroic , and no emission filter . Red and green channels were imaged simultaneously using a Dual - View emission splitter ( Optical Insights , supplied by Visitron ) inserted between the microscope body and the camera , which contained a 525 / 50 filter in the green channel , a 630 / 60 filter in the red channel , and a 595 nm dichroic to split red from green . Images were acquired using a Princeton Instruments MicroMax 512 EBFT camera driven by MetaMorph software ( both supplied by Visitron ) . For merged images the two channels were adjusted with a tolerance of 1 to 2 pixels . For GFP and mCherry ( Fig . 6 and movies 13 and 14 ) , the system was equipped with a two - line Andor laser combiner ( ALC , Andor Technology , Belfast , Northern Ireland ) housing a Cobolt Calypso ( 491 nm , 75 mW ) and a Cobolt Jive ( 561 nm , 75 mW ; Cobolt AB , Solna , Sweden ) solid - state laser , an AOTF and an Andor PCU100 control unit . Red and green channels were imaged concurrently using an OptoSplit image splitter ( Cairn Research Ltd . , Kent , UK ; equipped with a 565 DCXD dichroic , and BrightLine HC 525 / 30 and HC 628 / 40 emission filters . 3 All filters were from Chroma , Rockinham , VT , USA , or Semrock , Rochester , NY , USA ; supplied by AHF Analysentechnik , 72005 Tübingen , Germany . Images were acquired using an Andor iXon + DU897 _ BV ( Andor ) EM - CCD camera controlled by IQ 1 . 8 software . For the large image of Figure 6 the channels were fit to each other using red / green fluorescent beads and the program www . kalaimoscope . com ( S8 ) for correction . Photobleaching and recording of fluorescence recovery FRAP was performed using an Olympus FV - 1000 laser scanning confocal microscope with a 405 nm laser coupled through the simultaneous scanning port . This microscope configuration had two separate pairs of X - and Y - scanning mirrors which allowed image data to be continuously acquired using 488 - nm excitation while a small region of the sample was independently photobleached using a 405 - nm laser . The image acquisition rate was 64 ms per frame , with 500 ms of data acquisition prior to a 120 ms ( i . e . approximately 2 frames ) photobleach event . Photobleaching was performed using the ' cyclone ' bleach function , in which the laser starts in the middle of a circle and processes outward in a spiral pattern . Bleach size was 20 pixels ( approximately 2 microns in diameter ) . The time and intensity of photobleaching were selected to achieve greater than 75 % signal reduction in the selected region . Scanning was performed at zoom 8 ( 0 . 103 microns per pixel ) using an NA 1 . 1 PLAPO 60x OLSM objective in 12 bit acquisition mode . GFP was imaged over a 500 - 550 nm and mRFP over a 600 - 660 nm emission range . Care was taken to minimize saturated pixels in the acquired images . The profile of the bleached area was determined by bleaching a fluorescent plastic slide ( Chroma ) .
