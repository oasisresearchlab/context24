P ELHAM , J R . , AND Y U - LI W ANG Department of Physiology , University of Massachusetts Medical School , Worcester Foundation Campus , 222 Maple Avenue , Shrewsbury , MA 01545 Edited by Thomas D . Pollard , Salk Institute for Biological Studies , La Jolla , CA , and approved October 16 , 1997 ( received for review June 4 , 1997 ) ABSTRACT Responses of cells to mechanical properties of the adhesion substrate were examined by culturing normal rat kidney epithelial and 3T3 fibroblastic cells on a collagen - coated polyacrylamide substrate that allows the flexibility to be varied while maintaining a constant chemical environment . Compared with cells on rigid substrates , those on flexible substrates showed reduced spreading and increased rates of motility or lamellipodial activity . Microinjection of fluores - cent vinculin indicated that focal adhesions on flexible sub - strates were irregularly shaped and highly dynamic whereas those on firm substrates had a normal morphology and were much more stable . Cells on flexible substrates also contained a reduced amount of phosphotyrosine at adhesion sites . Treatment of these cells with phenylarsine oxide , a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor , induced the formation of normal , stable focal adhesions similar to those on firm substrates . Conversely , treatment of cells on firm substrates with myosin inhibitors 2 , 3 - butanedione monoxime or KT5926 caused the reduction of both vinculin and phosphotyrosine at adhesion sites . These results demonstrate the ability of cells to survey the mechanical properties of their surrounding environment and suggest the possible involvement of both protein tyrosine phosphorylation and myosin - generated cortical forces in this process . Such response to physical parameters likely repre - sents an important mechanism of cellular interaction with the surrounding environment within a complex organism . Adhesions between cells and the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) are known to modulate numerous critical cellular events such as gene expression ( 1 ) , embryonic development ( 1 ) , and cell locomotion ( 2 ) . This process involves interactions of ECM proteins , e . g . , collagen , fibronectin , or vitronectin , with the integrin family of transmembrane receptors . Subsequent cas - cade of events include the phosphorylation of proteins at adhesion sites and the recruitment of various cytoskeletal proteins to form focal adhesions ( 3 ) . A number of observations suggest that cell adhesion reac - tions involve not only receptor binding but also physical interactions and the cytoskeleton ( 4 – 9 ) . For example , it is well known that , to elicit a full response , ECM proteins must be immobilized or cross - linked ( 8 , 9 ) . In addition , previous studies have shown that cells can respond to forces exerted through surrounding fluid , adhered beads , or substrates ( 5 , 6 , 10 – 12 ) . Thus , mechanical forces may play a role in adhesion responses , and , conversely , cells may actively probe and respond to mechanical cues in the surrounding environment . Consistent with this latter idea , a number of studies suggest that physical and chemical properties of the adhesion substrate can pro - foundly affect cell locomotion , growth , and differentiation ( 13 – 15 ) . Although previous observations are suggestive , there has been no direct demonstration that cells can probe and respond to the mechanical property of the substrate . To test this hypothesis directly , it is necessary to culture cells on substrates with variable physical properties while maintaining a constant chemical environment . In this study , we have developed a thin polyacrylamide - based , collagen - coated flexible substrate . By maintaining a constant total concentration of acrylamide while varying the concentration of bis - acrylamide , we were able to obtain a series of chemically identical substrates with a wide range of flexibility . By using imaging techniques , we show that cells can respond to differences in substrate flexibility by altering both their adhesion structures and motile behavior . Moreover , the response appears to involve both tyrosine phosphorylation and forces generated by the actin - myosin cytoskeleton . MATERIALS AND METHODS Preparation of Polyacrylamide Substrate and RIA . Poly - acrylamide gels were attached to glass coverslips following a method described previously ( 16 ) . In brief , a large piece of coverglass ( No . 1 , 45 mm 3 50 mm ; Fisher ) was flamed in a Bunsen burner , soaked in 0 . 1N NaOH , and air dried . A small aliquot of 3 - aminopropyltrimethoxysilane ( Sigma ) was spread evenly onto the glass surface . After 4 – 5 min , the coverslips were washed and soaked in distilled H 2 O . The coverslips were then immersed for 30 min in a solution of 0 . 5 % glutaraldehyde ( Polysciences ) in PBS . Coverslips were then washed exten - sively in distilled H 2 O and air dried . Alternatively , coverslips were coated with nitrocellulose to increase the binding of the polyacrylamide ( 1 % stock in amyl acetate ; Ernest F . Fullam , Schenectady , NY ) . Twenty - five microliters of an acrylamide y bis - acrylamide mixture , containing 10 % acrylamide and bis concentrations ranging from 0 . 26 to 0 . 03 % , was then placed on the coverslip and covered with a small circular piece of coverglass ( No . 1 , 22 - mm diameter ; Fisher ) . After polymer - ization , the round coverglass was removed , and the gel was rinsed with 200 mM Hepes ( Boehringer Mannheim , pH 8 . 5 ) . The gel was then blot dried , and 200 m l of 50 mM sulfosuc - cinimidyl 6 ( 4 9 - azido - 2 9 - nitrophenyl - amino ) hexanoate ( Sulfo - SANPAH ; Pierce ) in 200 mM Hepes , pH 8 . 5 , was pipetted onto the surface . The coverslip chamber was exposed to the UV light of a sterile hood at a distance of 6 inches for 5 min . The Sulfo - SANPAH solution was then removed , and the photoac - tivation procedure was repeated . After photoactivation , the polyacrylamide sheet was washed several times in 200 mM Hepes ( pH 8 . 5 ) . A 0 . 2 - mg y ml solution of type I collagen ( United States Biochemical ) was then layered onto the sub - strate and allowed to react overnight at 4°C . After washing with 200 mM Hepes , the gels were stored at 4°C . To form a cell culture chamber , coverslips were attached with vacuum grease ( Dow Corning ) to a 70 3 50 3 6 - mm Plexiglass plate with a The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment .

Before plating cells , the gel was soaked for 30 – 45 min in culture medium at 37°C . A modified RIA ( 18 ) using mAb against type I collagen ( clone COL - 1 ) and 125 I - anti mouse IgG ( Amersham ) was used to determine the relative amount of collagen bound on the surface of polyacrylamide sheets . Characterization of Polyacrylamide Gels . The flexibility of polyacrylamide sheets with different acrylamide y bis - acrylamide ratios was determined both macroscopically and microscopically . Sheets of 69 mm 3 30 mm 3 1 mm were deformed with a force ( F ’ ) of 0 . 103 N ( Fig . 1A ) , and Young’s modulus ( 19 ) was calculated according to the equation : Y 5 ( F ’ y A ) y ( D l y l ) , where l is the original length of the sheet , D l is the change in length , and A is the cross - sectional area . Compliance or ‘‘stiffness’’ of thin gels used for cell culture was characterized microscopically by deforming with glass mi - croneedles ( 20 ) . The same needles were calibrated by mea - suring vertical movements of the tip after applying known submilligram weights . Gel compliance was calculated as N y m m deformation . Uncoated and collagen - coated substrates gave identical compliance and Young’s modulus values . Cell Culture and Drug Treatments . Normal rat kidney ( NRK ) - 52E ( American Type Culture Collection ) were cul - tured in F - 12K media ( Sigma ) , supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum ( JRH Biosciences , Lenexa , KS ) , 2 mM L - glutamine , 50 m g y ml streptomycin , 50 units y ml penicillin , and 250 ng y ml amphotericin B ( GIBCO y BRL ) . Swiss 3T3 cells ( ATCC ) were cultured in DMEM ( Sigma ) supplemented with 10 % donor calf serum ( JRH Biosciences ) and other additives as for NRK cells . For drug studies , phenylarsine oxide ( Sigma ) and KT5926 ( Calbiochem ) were each dissolved in dimethyl sulfox - ide to generate stock solutions of 10 mM and 2 mM , respec - tively . Immediately before drug treatments , aliquots of inhib - itor stocks were diluted in serum - containing media to obtain a final concentration of 5 m M for phenylarsine oxide and 20 m M for KT5926 . 2 , 3 - Butanedione monoxime ( Sigma ) was dissolved directly in culture medium to generate a working solution at the final concentration of 20 mM . Cells were incubated in KT5926 or 2 , 3 - butanedione monoxime for 20 min and phenylarsine oxide for 10 min before fixation and staining . Quantification of Cell Motility . To measure the dynamics of the lamellipodia in NRK cells , time - lapse sequences of cells located at the periphery of colonies were recorded over a period of 10 min by using a Zeiss 40 3 F - achromat phase contrast lens . The leading edge was traced using CORELDRAW ! 5 . 0 ( Corel , Ottawa ) . The position of several randomly chosen points was determined as a function of time , and the SD was used as a measurement of the fluctuation of the leading edge . The motility of 3T3 cells was determined by plotting the migration of the center of nuclei in randomly chosen cells over a period of 60 min . Fixation , Fluorescent Labeling , Immunoblotting , and Mi - croscopy . For fluorescence staining of vinculin , phosphoty - rosine , and actin , cells were washed in 37°C PBS containing 1 mM sodium orthovanadate ( Fisher ) , then fixed in 4 % form - aldehyde for 10 min ( 16 % stock solution ; Electron Microscopy Sciences , Fort Washington , PA ) and extracted with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 ( Boehringer Mannheim ) in PBS for 5 min . Immunofluorescence staining was performed by using mAb against vinculin ( clone VIN - 11 – 5 , Sigma ) or phosphotyrosine ( clone 4G10 , Upstate Biotechnology , Lake Placid , NY ) , each at a dilution of 1 : 100 . Rhodamine and fluorescein - conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Sigma . Staining of cells with fluorescein - phalloidin ( Molecular Probes ) , microin - jection of fluorescently labeled vinculin , and fluorescence microscopy were performed as described ( 21 – 23 ) . A Nikon 60 3 , N . A . 1 . 2 , PlanApo water immersion objective was used for the observation of fluorescent vinculin in living cells . Other fluorescence images were collected with either a Zeiss 63 3 , N . A . 1 . 25 Neofluar objective or a Zeiss 100 3 , N . A . 1 . 30 Neofluar objective lens . Both phase and fluorescence images were recorded with a cooled charged coupled device camera ( TE y CCD - 576EM ; Princeton Instruments , Trenton , NJ , or CH250 ; Photometrics , Tucson , AZ ) . Immunoblotting was performed following published procedures ( 7 ) . RESULTS We prepared a series of polyacrylamide substrates with 10 % acrylamide and with bis - acrylamide ranging from 0 . 03 to 0 . 26 % . Because cultured cells did not adhere to bare poly - acrylamide surfaces , the substrate was activated chemically with a photoactivatible heterobifunctional reagent and reacted with type I collagen . RIAs indicated that the relative surface concentration of collagen varied by , 3 % among the substrates regardless of the flexibility . To facilitate observations with phase and fluorescence optics at high magnifications , we prepared sheets with a thickness of ’ 40 m m , which were attached to coverslips through either nitrocellulose coating or a chemical reaction . The elastic property of the substrate was tested first by applying known forces to large suspended sheets ( Fig . 1 A ) . The length of polyacrylamide sheets increased in proportion to the F IG . 1 .

Similarly , 3T3 cells on the substrate of high flexibility are typically less well spread and with a polarized morphology ( F ) . Bar 5 10 m m . 13662 Cell Biology : Pelham and Wang Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 94 ( 1997 ) applied force and , upon the release of forces , recovered fully within a second . Thus , the substrate behaves as an ideal material for testing the effect of substrate elasticity on cell behavior . The Young’s modulus showed a 12 - fold difference between sheets of 0 . 26 and 0 . 03 % bis - acrylamide ( Fig . 1 A and B ) . The substrates also were probed microscopically with a calibrated microneedle to determine substrate ‘‘stiffness’’ or compliance ( 20 ) . The compliance displayed a 16 - fold differ - ence ( ’ 7 . 3 3 10 2 7 N y m m vs . ’ 4 . 6 3 10 2 8 N y m m ) between substrates of 0 . 26 and 0 . 03 % bis - acrylamide . On more rigid substrates , both NRK epithelial cells and 3T3 fibroblasts were well spread and appeared indistinguishable from those cultured on glass or plastic surfaces ( Fig . 1 C and E ) . When cells were cultured on increasingly flexible sub - strates , there was a corresponding change in morphology : NRK cells became less well spread and irregularly shaped ( Fig . 1 D ) . Phase - dense ruffles appeared not only along the periph - ery but on the ventral surface of the cell ( Fig . 1 D , arrow ) . 3T3 cells lost most of their stress fibers ( not shown ) and became increasingly spindle - shaped . Cells with an elongated body and a lamellipodium at one end increased from 47 % on substrates of 0 . 26 % bis - to 69 % on substrates of 0 . 03 % bis - acrylamide ( Fig . 1 F ) . To rule out the possibility that the morphological changes observed were due to the differential loss of covalently bound collagen from the substrate , cells were cultured on either 0 . 26 % or 0 . 03 % substrate to a high density , then lysed with 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 . RIA with anti - type I collagen antibodies indicated that the collagen concentration did not decrease on either stiff or flexible substrates as a result of cell growth , when compared with control substrates not used for cell culture . The altered cell morphology on flexible substrates suggests that there may be differences in the rate of motility . On rigid 0 . 26 % bis - acrylamide substrates , 3T3 cells migrated at an average rate of 0 . 06 m m y min . This rate increased to 0 . 55 m m y min ( Fig . 2 C ; n 5 68 ) on soft substrates of 0 . 03 % bis - acrylamide . On both rigid and soft substrates , NRK epi - thelial cells remained associated with colonies and underwent little net nuclear migration . However , lamellipodial ruffling along the periphery of the colony was much more active on soft substrates . As shown in Fig . 2 A , the extent of fluctuation in lamellipodia boundary differed by ’ 6 - fold between rigid ( 0 . 26 % bis - acrylamide ) and flexible ( 0 . 03 % bis - acrylamide ) substrates ( Fig . 2 A and B ) . Thus , it is possible that cells can respond to differences in substrate adhesion structures on substrates of different flexi - bility . We speculate that the responses of cells to substrate flexibility most likely originate at cell substrate adhesion sites , where mechanical input might be translated into intracellular signals through the associated cytoskeleton or enzyme com - plexes . To test this hypothesis , we first microinjected NRK cells cultured on polyacrylamide sheets with fluorescently labeled vinculin . Cells on more rigid substrates ( 0 . 26 % bis - acrylamide ) formed arrays of stable , elongated focal adhesions , which showed only minor changes over a period of 10 min ( Fig . 3 A and C , arrows ) . On flexible substrates ( 0 . 03 % bis - acrylamide ) the adhesion sites appeared as irregular punctate structures ; many of which appeared and disappeared within 10 min ( Fig . 3 B and D , arrows ) . The behavior of adhesion structures on flexible substrates appears similar to that seen in transformed cells ( 21 ) . Because signaling at focal adhesions is believed to involve protein tyrosine kinases y phosphatases ( 1 , 3 , 7 , 24 – 27 ) , we asked whether there is a change in phosphotyrosine distribu - tion in response to substrate flexibility . Immunofluorescence staining revealed that phosphotyrosine organization paral - leled that of vinculin : When cells were plated on increasingly flexible substrates , the site of staining changed from wedge - shaped focal adhesions into irregular punctate structures ( Fig . 3 E and F , arrows ) . Parallel immunoblot studies with anti - phosphotyrosine Py20 antibody indicated that , on flexible substrates , there was a large reduction in the overall extent of phosphorylation ( Fig . 3 G ) compared with cells plated on plastic or rigid surfaces . Two of the major tyrosine - phosphorylated bands were identified as pp125 FAK and pax - illin , based on immunoreactivity with FAK - specific antibodies and electrophoretic mobilities , respectively . Thus , it is possible that stiff substrates stimulate an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation , which then leads to the formation of stable focal adhesions . To test this possibility , cells on highly flexible substrates were treated with phenylarsine oxide ( PAO ) , a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor ( 27 ) , to cause an artificial increase in tyrosine phosphorylation . The treatment inhibited ruffling activities and caused the appearance of elongated focal adhesions at the cell boundary ( Fig . 4 A – D , arrows ) , indistinguishable from those on rigid substrates with - out PAO ( Fig . 3 A , C , E , arrows ) . Time - lapse recording of cells injected with fluorescent vinculin indicated that these focal adhesions were as stable as those on stiff substrates ( not shown ) . To test the role of the cortical cytoskeleton in cellular responses to substrate flexibility , we treated cells on polyacryl - amide substrates with KT5926 , a potent inhibitor of the myosin light chain kinase ( 28 ) , or 2 , 3 - butanedione monoxime , an F IG . 2 .

Images of cells were recorded every 2 min over a period of 10 min and active lamellipoda were traced and overlaid to generate the plots . The degree of lamellipodial protrusion y retraction was then quantified based on the SD of the position of seven randomly chosen points along the active edge . Fifteen cells were analyzed under each bis - acrylamide concen - tration ( B ) . Lamellipodia become less active with increasing rigidity of the substrate .

Both compounds caused the disappearance of normal focal adhesions on firm substrates and the formation of irregular punctate vinculin - containing structures similar to those seen on highly flexible substrates . Parallel changes were observed with the staining of phospho - tyrosine ( Fig . 4 E – H , arrows ) . However , unlike cells on flexible substrates , myosin - inhibited cells showed neither enhanced motility nor rapid changes in adhesion structures , which likely reflect the involvement of myosin - generated forces in these processes . DISCUSSION Although it may be possible to address this issue with the silicone rubber substrates developed by Harris and improved in a recent study ( 20 , 30 – 31 ) , the ECM - coated polyacrylamide substrate has several important features . ( i ) It allows system - atic and reproducible control of the flexibility of the substrate by changing the relative concentration of acrylamide and bis - acrylamide . ( ii ) Its superb optical quality and minimal thickness permits the observation of both immunofluores - cence and microinjected fluorescent analogs at a high magni - fication . ( iii ) The substrate uses specific ECM molecules as the ligand for cell adhesion whereas polyacrylamide itself shows no detectable interaction with the cell surface . ( iv ) The porous nature of the polyacrylamide gel provides a more physiological environment for cell culture ( 32 ) , particularly for epithelial cells . ( v ) Mechanical properties of the substrate can be char - acterized on both macro - and microscopic scales , with a nearly ideal elastic behavior in both cases . Our results with 3T3 and NRK cells demonstrate the ability of cultured cells to detect the flexibility of the surrounding environment , and to regulate their adhesion structures and motility accordingly . On flexible substrates , fibroblasts mi - grate at a faster rate , and epithelial cells show elevated lamellipodial protrusion y retraction activities . These responses may be a result of destabilized adhesion , as indicated by microinjected fluorescent vinculin , and y or responses to signals that originate at the adhesion sites . F IG . 3 . Distribution of vinculin and phosphotyrosine in NRK cells cultured on substrates with 0 . 26 % bis - acrylamide ( A , C , E ) or 0 . 03 % bis - acrylamide ( B , D , F ) . ( A – D ) Cells were injected with rhodamine - labeled vinculin and imaged over a period of 10 min . On more rigid substrates ( A , C ) , vinculin is incorporated into elongated focal adhe - sions , which show only minor changes during the period of observation .

On plastic dishes ( CON ) and rigid 0 . 26 % bis - acrylamide substrates ( 0 . 26 % ) , pp125 FAK , paxillin and a 97 - kDa protein are heavily phosphorylated after 48 hr of culture .

Role of tyrosine phosphorylation and myosin in the mod - ulation of adhesion structures on flexible substrates . Cells were treated with PAO ( A – D ) or 2 , 3 - butanedione monoxime ( E – H ) and processed for vinculin ( A , B , E , F ) or phosphotyrosine ( C , D , G , H ) immuno - fluorescence . Treatment of cells with PAO resulted in the formation of large focal adhesions in cells on both soft ( 0 . 03 % bis - acrylamide ; B , D ) and rigid ( 0 . 26 % bis - acrylamide ; A , C ) substrates . Treatment with 2 , 3 - butanedione monoxime disrupted adhesion structures of cells cultured on substrates with either 0 . 26 % bis - acrylamide ( E , G ) , or 0 . 03 % bis - acrylamide ( F , H ) , and caused vinculin ( E , F ) and phos - photyrosine ( G , H ) to localize at small punctate structures regardless of the substrate flexibility . Bar 5 10 m m . 13664 Cell Biology : Pelham and Wang Proc . Natl . Acad . Sci . USA 94 ( 1997 ) Immunofluorescene and immunoblots of phosphotyrosine suggest that signals elicited by a stiff substrate involve either the stimulation of a tyrosine kinase or inhibition of a tyrosine phosphatase . In addition , by artificially maintaining a high level of tyrosine phosphorylation through PAO - inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases , cells can bypass the stimulus elicited by stiff substrates and always assume a morphology characteristic of that on rigid surfaces . Although it is difficult to rule out indirect effects , these results are consistent with the idea that increases in tyrosine phosphorylation , in response to substrate stiffness , cause the formation of mature , stable focal adhesions and possibly also reduced ruffling activities . How could cells sense the difference among substrates of identical chemical properties but varying flexibilities ? The most plausible mechanism involves active pushing y pulling of its integrin receptors through the associated cytoskeleton ; the response then leads to changes in tyrosine phosphorylation . Our observations with myosin inhibitors are consistent with the idea that a myosin motor is involved in probing substrate mechanical properties . Presumably , upon the inhibition of myosin , cells lose their ability to detect the resistance to adhesion forces and interpret all substrates as being flexible . Although alternative explanations are possible , this interpre - tation is supported by a recent observation that myosin is required for the increase in tyrosine phosphosphorylation induced by lysophosphatidic acid ( 7 ) . In addition , treatment of endothelial cells with cytochalasin D causes a decrease in the extent of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation ( 33 ) . An attractive hypothesis is that , when receptors become anchored to a rigid substrate or cross - linked , the resistance to cytoskeleton - generated forces causes an increase in tension at adhesion structures and activates downstream signals through a force - sensitive enzyme complex . However , to detect flexi - bility , it is necessary for the cells to modulate and measure the probing force in response to different substrate resistance ( otherwise , cells will simply deform soft substrates to an increasing extent until they experience a similar resistance as on stiff substrates ) . Alternatively , cells may be able to measure the amount of substrate deformation as they apply a defined probing force . These possibilities are speculative at present , and the precise mechanism for cells to probe and respond to substrate flexibility remains to be elucidated . The present results , together with a growing list of obser - vations suggesting that cells can respond to both the magnitude and distribution of adhesion forces ( 34 ) , strongly indicate that communications through physical signals are as important as communications through chemical messengers . Physiologi - cally , mechanical properties of cells’ surrounding environment could be modulated by synthesis y degradation of ECM proteins ( 1 ) , the movement of surrounding cells , or pressure y fluid shear of the blood flow ( 10 , 11 ) . Such events are likely to occur frequently during embryonic development and wound healing ( 1 , 35 ) and may play an important role in guiding cell move - ment and regulating cell functions .
