We visualized F - actin organization and dynamics in living Neurospora crassa cells via confocal microscopy of growing hyphae expressing GFP fusions with homologues of the actin - binding proteins ﬁmbrin ( FIM ) and tropo - myosin ( TPM - 1 ) , a subunit of the Arp2 / 3 complex ( ARP - 3 ) and a recently developed live cell F - actin mar - ker , Lifeact ( ABP140 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) . FIM - GFP , ARP - 3 - GFP , and Lifeact - GFP associated with small patches in the cortical cytoplasm that were concentrated in a subapical ring , which appeared sim - ilar for all three markers but was broadest in hyphae expressing Lifeact - GFP . These cortical patches were short - lived , and a subset was mobile throughout the hypha , exhibiting both anterograde and retrograde motility . TPM - 1 - GFP and Lifeact - GFP co - localized within the Spitzenkörper ( Spk ) core at the hyphal apex , and were also observed in actin cables throughout the hypha . All GFP fusion proteins studied were also transiently localized at septa : Lifeact - GFP ﬁrst appeared as a broad ring during early stages of contractile ring formation and later coalesced into a sharper ring , TPM - 1 - GFP was observed in maturing septa , and FIM - GFP / ARP3 - GFP - labeled cortical patches formed a double ring ﬂanking the septa . Our observations suggest that each of the N . crassa F - actin - binding proteins analyzed associates with a different subset of F - actin structures , presumably reﬂecting distinct roles in F - actin organization and dynamics . Moreover , Lifeact - GFP marked the broadest spectrum of F - actin structures ; it may serve as a global live cell marker for F - actin in ﬁlamentous fungi . (cid:2) 2010 Elsevier Inc .

Introduction The importance of F - actin in tip - growing cells was recognized in fungal hyphae , in which growth and cell wall extension are fo - cused at a single site at the apex resulting in production of a tube shaped cell ( Bartnicki - Garcia and Lippman , 1977 ; Hasek and Bartn - icki - Garcia , 1994 ; Heath et al . , 2000 ; Bartnicki - Garcia , 2002 ) . In re - cent years , many studies have reafﬁrmed the central importance of F - actin and associated proteins in growth and spatial regulation of organelles in tip - growing cells ( Harris and Momany , 2004 ; Virag and Grifﬁths , 2004 ; Harris et al . , 2005 ; Upadhyay and Shaw , 2008 ) . Studies designed to disrupt F - actin function using chemical agents such as cytochalasins and latrunculin B conﬁrmed that a polymerized actin cytoskeleton is required for normal apical growth , hyphal tip shape , and polarized enzyme secretion in differ - ent fungal organisms ( McGoldrick et al . , 1995 ; Harris et al . , 1997 ; Torralba et al . , 1998 ; McDaniel and Roberson , 2000 ; Taheri - Talesh et al . , 2008 ) . F - actin interacts with many associated proteins that regulate its arrangement and organization . In a wide variety of species studied , F - actin can be found as patches , cables and / or actomyosin contrac - tile rings associated with septum formation ; each of these arrays is responsible for a distinct actin - dependent process ( Adams et al . , 1991 ; Roberson , 1992 ; Arai et al . , 1998 ; Sandrock et al . , 1999 ; Pruyne and Bretscher , 2000 ; Bretscher , 2003 ; Moseley and Goode , 2006 ; Upadhyay and Shaw , 2008 ; Taheri - Talesh et al . , 2008 ) . For example , tropomyosin stabilizes F - actin and regulates F - actin mechanics ( Greenberg et al . , 2008 ) , Arp2 / 3 complex nucleates F - actin branches ( Egile et al . , 2005 ) and ﬁmbrin cross - links F - actin into bundles and networks ( de Arruda et al . , 1990 ) . Another F - actin - dependent process important for fungal devel - opment is septum formation . The vegetative mycelia of many 1087 - 1845 / $ - see front matter (cid:2) 2010 Elsevier Inc .

Fungal Genetics and Biology 47 ( 2010 ) 573 – 586 Contents lists available at ScienceDirect Fungal Genetics and Biology journal homepage : www . elsevier . com / locate / yfgbi ﬁlamentous fungi are composed of multinucleated cells divided by regularly spaced septa . Septa construction requires regulation of mitotic signaling , cytokinesis and cell wall biosynthesis ( Momany et al . , 1995 ) . During septum formation , a conserved set of proteins follow a similar temporal and spatial pathway in different eukary - otes to assemble F - actin - containing structures that contribute to septation ( Bezanilla et al . , 2000 ; Paoletti and Chang , 2000 ; Wong et al . , 2002 ; Motegi et al . , 2000 , 2004 ) . It is well established that the actin - based contractile ring functions in membrane contraction at septation , but the role of actin patches is less clear . The Arp2 / 3 complex is found in F - actin patches ﬂanking the contractile ring in Schizosaccharomyces pombe ( McCollum et al . , 1996 ; Arai et al . , 1998 ; Wu et al . , 2006 ) . These patches are thought to promote endocytic uptake required for cytokinesis in S . pombe , although the Arp2 / 3 complex is not required for cytokinesis in Drosophila melanogaster ( Eggert et al . , 2004 ) . In ﬁlamentous fungi , actin visualized by various methods has been observed in the Spk , a vesicle - rich area of the hyphal apical cytoplasm directly adjacent to the growth site ( Howard , 1981 ; Roberson and Fuller , 1988 ; Bourett and Howard , 1991 ; Roberson , 1992 ; Virag and Grifﬁths , 2004 ; Harris et al . , 2005 ; Upadhyay and Shaw , 2008 ; Taheri - Talesh et al . , 2008 ) . The population of F - ac - tin in the Spk has been proposed to regulate vesicle delivery and / or fusion at the growth site ( exocytosis ) , and may also regulate cal - cium channels , whose activity is important for tip growth ( Bartn - icki - Garcia and Lippman , 1977 ; Hasek and Bartnicki - Garcia , 1994 ; Bartnicki - Garcia , 2002 ; Harris and Momany , 2004 ; Harris et al . , 2005 ) . Cortical F - actin patches have been proposed to play a role in plasma membrane invagination during endocytosis in ﬁl - amentous fungi as in yeasts ( Mulholland et al . , 1994 ; Harris and Momany , 2004 ; Ayscough , 2005 ; Rodal et al . , 2005 ) . In all fungi examined , F - actin patches are located at sites of active endocytic uptake ( i . e . , the subapex and septa ) ( Ayscough , 2005 ; Gachet and Hyams , 2005 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2005 ; Upadhyay and Shaw , 2008 ; Taheri - Talesh et al . , 2008 ) . Most studies of F - actin organization in ﬁlamentous fungi have used anti - actin antibodies or rhodamine phalloidin to label ﬁxed cells . Filamentous actin is notoriously difﬁcult to preserve during ﬁxation and can often be difﬁcult to adequately label ( e . g . , phalloi - din is usable for only a small number of fungal species ) . Thus , some of the differences previously described in studies with different fungi may be caused by ﬁxation artifacts or the source of anti - actin antibodies ( Heath et al . , 2000 ; Virag and Grifﬁths , 2004 ) . Recently , live - cell imaging of F - actin has been carried out in Aspergillus nidu - lans germlings using green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) fused to G - ac - tin and to different F - actin - binding proteins ( ABPs ) such as ﬁmbrin and tropomyosin ( Upadhyay and Shaw , 2008 ; Taheri - Talesh et al . , 2008 ) . Our study was focused on visualization of the F - actin cytoskel - eton in order to describe its dynamics and organization during hy - phal growth and septum formation using different microscopy techniques in living mature hyphae of Neurospora crassa . We used ABPs , such as tropomyosin , Arp2 / 3 complex and ﬁmbrin fused to GFP and a recently developed live cell F - actin reporter called Life - act ( Riedl et al . , 2008 ) . 2 . Materials and methods 2 . 1 . Strains and culture conditions Strains used in this study are listed in Table 1A . Strains were maintained on Vogel’s minimal medium ( VMM ) with 2 % sucrose . All manipulations were according to standard techniques ( Davis , 2000 ) . 2 . 2 . Construction of GFP - containing plasmids Standard PCR and cloning procedures ( Sambrook et al . , 1989 ) were used to fuse the sgfp gene to the carboxyl terminus of ﬁm , abd1 , abd2 , ( truncated version of ﬁmbrin ) , arp - 2 , arp - 3 and tpm - 1 . We constructed a ﬁmbrin full - length GFP fusion and two trun - cated versions , each containing one actin - binding domain ( abd1 or abd2 ) ( Fig . 1A ) ( Wang et al . , 2004b ) . All the genes and truncated versions of ﬁmbrin were ampliﬁed by PCR from N . crassa ( FGSC 2489 ) genomic DNA . Primers used are listed in Table 1B . PCR was performed in a Bio - Rad Thermal Cycler with Platinum Hi - ﬁ Taq polymerase ( Invitrogen , Carlsbald , CA ) according to the manufac - turer’s instructions . The ampliﬁed and gel - puriﬁed PCR products were digested with XbaI and PacI and ligated into XbaI - and PacI - di - gested plasmid pMF272 ( GenBank Accession No . AY598428 ) . This yielded pRM08 - DD01 ( ﬁm ) , pRM11 - DD02 ( abd1 ) , pRM10 - DD03 ( abd2 ) and pRM47 - OC28 ( tpm - 1 ) ( Table 1C ) . Only those without changes to the amino acid sequence were used in this study . N . crassa transformed with the Abd1 - GFP construct showed no spe - ciﬁc localization of GFP and was not examined further . The arp - 3 gene ampliﬁed was digested with XbaI and BamHI and cloned into XbaI - and BamHI - digested pMF272 giving rise to the pLS - NG02 ( arp3 ) ( Table 1C ) . The arp - 2 coding region and 943 nucleotides of sequence upstream of the ATG were ampliﬁed , digested with SpeI and BamHI and ligated into a SpeI - and BamHI - digested pMF272 lacking the ccg - 1 promoter producing the pLS - NG01 ( arp - 2 ) ( Table 1C ) . To create this derivative , pMF272 was digested with NotI and XbaI , ends were ﬁlled in with Klenow , and the larger fragment was self - ligated .

L . Delgado - Álvarez et al . / Fungal Genetics and Biology 47 ( 2010 ) 573 – 586 vector - derived sequences encode an 8 amino acid linker ( AGIPGLIN ) separating the last amino acid of ARP - 2 or ARP - 3 from the ﬁrst amino acid of GFP ( Egile et al . , 2005 ) . The ﬁrst 17 aa ( MGVADLIKKFESISKEE ) of Abp140 of S . cerevisiae were shown to label F - actin comparable to the full - length protein . This small peptide named ‘Lifeact’ is conserved among many fungal species and it is a good F - actin marker for higher eukaryotes ( Riedl et al . , 2008 ) . Lifeact sequence was cloned into pMF272 as a C - ter - minal GFP fusion ( Lifeact - GFP ) with the linker GDPPVAT . The Life - act - linker - egfp was ampliﬁed by PCR and digested with XbaI and ApaI and ligated into XbaI - and ApaI - digested pMF27 into pMF272 , removing the sgfp sequence in the plasmid . This yielded pRM49 - OC30 ( Lifeact - gfp ) . All constructs were sequenced at Eton Biosciences ( San Diego , CA ) . 2 . 3 . Transformation protocols , transformant selection and crosses Transformation of N . crassa strain FGSC9717 D mus - 51 his - 3 con - idia with non - linearized plasmids ( Table 1C ) was carried out by electroporation on a Bio - Rad Gene Pulser ( capacitance , 25 l F ; 1 . 5 kV ; resistance , 600 X ) as previously described . Prototrophic his + transformants were screened for the expression of GFP by epi - ﬂuorescence microscopy as described previously ( Freitag et al . , 2004 ) . Transformants showing strong ﬂuorescence were selected . The heterokaryon strain selected of each transformation was crossed to the homokaryotic strain mat a ( FGSC2489 ) . Strains were crossed routinely on Petri plates with synthetic crossing medium ( SCM ) supplemented with 1 % sucrose and 2 % agar ( Davis , 2000 ) . 2 . 4 . Single cell double labeling To observe the relationship between ABPs we constructed two heterokaryons from three N . crassa strains , one with the Lifeact - GFP and TPM - 1 - mchFP and the other with Abd2 - GFP and TPM - 1 - mchFP . A Petri plate with VMM was inoculated with mycelia from each pair of strains and incubated for 12 h at 30 (cid:3) C . The margin of the colonies was screened for hyphae having both ﬂuorescent mak - ers and then imaged following the procedure described for laser scanning confocal microscopy . 2 . 5 . F - actin and microtubules depolymerization assays Stock solutions of cytochalasin A ( Cyt A ) ( Sigma – Aldrich , St . Louis , Mo ) , latrunculin A ( Lat A ) ( anti - actin drugs ) and benomyl ( anti - microtubules drug ) ( Sigma – Aldrich ) at 10 mg ml (cid:2) 1 were pre - pared in 100 % ethanol . The concentration that inhibited the hyphal growth rate by 50 % was selected from Ramos - Garcia et al . ( 2009 ) for further studies . To study the effect of Cyt A and Lat A on the dis - tribution of ABPs in N . crassa , we exposed the cells to 1 l g ml (cid:2) 1 of Cyt A and 20 l g ml (cid:2) 1 of Lat A diluted in VMM broth . A drop of 50 l l of the solution was placed on a coverslip , a block of agar ( Hickey et al . , 2002 ) containing N . crassa mycelium was placed on the inhibitor solution , and after 5 – 10 min of exposure the cells were observed . For benomyl experiments , we inoculated VMM plates amended with 2 . 5 l g ml (cid:2) 1 and incubated at 28 (cid:3) C until the cells reached a young mycelium stage ( (cid:3) 16 h ) . For all treatments , myce - lia were observed following the procedure described for laser scan - ning confocal microscopy ( see below ) . 2 . 6 . Laser scanning confocal microscopy of living cells Strains containing ﬁm : : sgfp , abd1 : : sgfp , abd2 : : sgfp , tpm - 1 : : sgfp , arp - 2 : : sgpf , arp - 3 : : sgfp and Lifeact - egfp were grown on VMM . The ‘‘inverted agar block” method ( Hickey et al . , 2002 ) was used for live - cell imaging with an inverted laser scanning microscope ( LSM - 510 Meta , Carl Zeiss , Göttingen , Germany ) equipped with an argon ion laser for excitation at 488 nm wavelength and GFP ﬁl - ters for emission at 515 – 530 nm . An oil immersion objective was used : 100 (cid:4) ( PH3 ) / 1 . 3 N . A . Laser intensity was kept to a minimum ( 1 . 5 % ) to reduce photobleaching and phototoxic effects . Time - lapse imaging was performed at scan intervals of 0 . 5 – 4 . 5 s for periods up to 40 min . Image resolution was 512 (cid:4) 512 pixels and 300 dpi . Confocal images were captured using LSM - 510 software ( version 3 . 2 ; Carl Zeiss ) and evaluated with an LSM 510 Image Examiner . Some of the image series were converted into movies ( (cid:5) . mov ) using the same software . Time - lapse images of hyphae were recorded simultaneously by phase contrast microscopy and ﬂuorescent con - focal microscopy . Phase contrast images were captured with a pho - tomultiplier for transmitted light using the same laser illumination for ﬂuorescence ( Mouriño - Pérez et al . , 2006 ) . Final images were processed , and ﬁgures were created using Adobe Photoshop CS3 Extended ( Adobe Systems Inc . , San Jose , CA ) . 2 . 7 . Total Internal Reﬂection Fluorescence Microscopy ( TIRFM ) of living cells TIRFM selectively illuminates and excites ﬂuorophores in a re - stricted region of the specimen immediately adjacent to the Fig . 1 . Fimbrin reporters driven by the ccg - 1 promoter .

The evanescent electromagnetic ﬁeld penetrates to a depth of only approximately 100 nm into the sample medium . Thus the TIRFM enables a selective visualization of surface regions such as the basal plasma membrane ( Axelrod , 2001 ; Steyer and Al - mers , 2001 ) . For TIRFM , an IX - 70 inverted microscope equipped with a 60 (cid:4) / 1 . 45 N . A . Apochromat objective lens ( Olympus Corp . , Melville , NY ) and a krypton / argon laser ( Melles Griot , Carlsbad , CA ) ( 488 nm ) was used . Images were recorded with a Cascade 512B EMCCD cam - era ( Photometrics , Tucson , AZ ) for durations of 2 – 3 min at 512 (cid:4) 512 resolution and frame rates of 50 – 100 ms . MetaMorph 6 . 0 / 6 . 1 software ( Universal Imaging , Downingtown , PA ) was used to control the camera and capture images . Final images were pro - cessed , and ﬁgures were created with Adobe Photoshop CS3 Ex - tended ( Adobe Systems Inc . ) . 2 . 8 . Membrane ﬂuorescent staining Using the ‘‘inverted agar block method” of preparing and stain - ing samples ( Hickey et al . , 2002 ) , GFP - expressing strains were incubated with 2 . 5 l M FM4 – 64 ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) , which labels the plasma membrane and organelle membranes ( Fischer - Parton et al . , 2000 ) . 2 . 9 . Hyphal regions Hyphal regions were deﬁned previously ( McDaniel and Rober - son , 2000 ; Ramos - Garcia et al . , 2009 ) . Region I contains the Spk , Region II extends from the posterior side of the Spk to the anterior side of the ﬁrst nucleus , and Region III extends over a variable dis - tance from the anterior side of the ﬁrst nucleus to a zone character - ized by the presence of large vacuoles . 3 . Results 3 . 1 . Construction of F - actin reporters To test F - actin reporters in live cells of N . crassa , we constructed seven different F - actin reporters fused to GFP , full - length ﬁmbrin , Abd1 and Abd2 ( derived from ﬁmbrin ) , tropomyosin , Arp - 2 , Arp - 3 and Lifeact . Fimbrin contains two tandem repeats , each com - posed of two calponin - like ( CH ) domains that bind F - actin ( Mose - ley and Goode , 2006 ) ; we named Abd1 and Abd2 each binding region . Therefore , we generated a full - length FIM - GFP and the truncated ﬁmbrin constructs Abd1 - GFP and Abd2 - GFP ( Fig . 1A ) . Confocal imaging of N . crassa hyphae expressing these constructs from the ccg - 1 promoter revealed that the patterns of full length FIM - GFP and Abd2 - GFP localization were identical ( Fig . 1B , Movies 1 and 2 ) . Both fusions were observed in the same parts of the hy - phae , showed the same behavior , had the same response to F - actin depolymerization drugs and were equally bright . Therefore , for this study we observed the transformants expressing either Abd2 - GFP or FIM - GFP in order to describe the behavior of the full - length pro - tein . Abd1 - GFP was not used because it did not show ﬂuorescence . Full - length tropomyosin ( TPM - 1 ) , ARP - 2 and ARP - 3 were fused GFP , all driven by the ccg - 1 promoter ( Fig . 2A ) . Additionally , an ARP - 2 construct driven by its endogenous promoter was tested . The distribution and ﬂuorescence intensity of both ARP2 - GFP con - structs ( ccg - 1 and the endogenous promoter - driven ) and ARP - 3 - GFP were the same ( data not shown ) . Thus , we focused on the ARP - 3 - GFP marker for the studies reported here . We also used the reporter named Lifeact consisting of the ﬁrst 17 aa of Abp140 of S . cerevisiae fused to the N - terminus of egfp ) ( Fig . 2A ) . 3 . 2 . F - actin in the Spk ( Region I ) During hyphal growth , FIM - GFP ( Fig . 1A ) and the ARP - 3 - SGFP ( Fig . 2B ) complex were not observed in the Spk region . TPM - 1 - GFP colocalized with the Spk ( Fig . 2B , Movie 3 ) . It was present as a spherical - shaped aggregation of 1 . 5 ± 0 . 4 l m ( mean ± standard error ) in diameter that occupied (cid:3) 80 % of the total area of the Spk and corresponded to the core ( Fig . 2C and D ) . Lifeact - GFP also colocalized with the Spk core ( 1 . 5 ± 0 . 6 l m of diameter ) ( Fig . 2B ) . The dynamics of TPM - 1 - GFP and Lifeact - GFP mirrored Spk behav - ior ( Movies 3 and 4 ) . 3 . 3 . F - actin in the subapex ( Region II ) In region II , which extends from the posterior side of the Spk to the anterior side of the ﬁrst nucleus , FIM - GFP , Abd2 - GFP , Lifeact - GFP , and ARP - 3 - GFP were present as small cortical patches ( 0 . 5 l m ± 0 . 1 , n = 100 ) that formed a ring ( Fig . 1B , 2B ; Movies 1 – 5 ) . In all cases , the cortical rings started (cid:3) 4 . 2 – 4 . 5 l m from the apex ( Fig . 3A ) . Although , the ring widths varied , Lifeact - GFP rings had the greatest width ( 21 . 3 ± 1 . 6 l m ; n = 60 ) ( Fig . 3B ) . As the hypha elongated , the ring of patches followed the apex , keeping a constant distance , except in the cases where hyphal extension stopped and the Spk disassembled ( Fig . 4 ) . In these cases , the ring of patches reachedthehyphaltip , thoughasgrowthresumedtheringwasposi - tioned subapically at its typical location . The FIM - GFP , ARP - 3 - GFP andLifeact - GFPpatchesappearto co - localizewith the cytosolicface of the plasma membrane stained with FM4 - 64 ( Fig . 2B ) . To conﬁrm the spatial distribution of the Abd2 - GFP ring , we performed a 3D reconstruction of confocal z - stacks ( Movie 6 ) . In this reconstruction it was possible to observe that the patches formed a complete cortical ring around the hyphal subapex . ARP - 3 - GFP had the same pattern ( data not shown ) . 3 . 4 . F - actin in distal parts of hyphae ( Region III ) In distal parts of the hyphae , ( i . e . , from the anterior side of the ﬁrst nucleus to a zone characterized by the presence of large vac - uoles ) , it was possible to observe Lifeact - GFP and all the ABPs stud - ied ( TPM - 1 - GFP , FIM - GFP and ARP - 3 - GFP ) . TPM - 1 - GFP and Lifeact - GFP formed long and thin cable - like structures in the cell cortex ar - ranged parallel to the longitudinal axis of the hypha ( Fig . 5 ) . Life - act - GFP patches were often closely associated with the cables ( Figs . 5 and 8D ) . FIM - GFP , ARP - 3 - GFP and Lifeact - GFP patches were present in a lower density in the basal region of hyphae compared to the subapex . 3 . 5 . F - actin associated with septa During the formation of septa , Lifeact - GFP , TPM - 1 - GFP , FIM - GFP and ARP - 3 - GFP were transiently present , although they were local - ized differently and appeared at different stages of septal develop - ment . To show the order of appearance of different F - actin structures during septation , we arbitrarily considered the time when it was ﬁrst possible to observe membrane invagination by FM4 - 64 staining as time zero ( arrowheads , Fig . 6A – C ) . Lifeact - GFP appeared 4 : 24 ± 0 : 51 min : s , before time zero , appearing as a mesh of F - actin cables and patches around the future septation site ( Fig . 6B and D ) . After a few minutes , the network of cables coa - lesced to form a contractile ring ( Fig . 6B and D , Movie 7 ) . Mem - brane contraction began and the Lifeact - GFP ring contracted with the membrane , reaching the center of the hypha and disappearing from the periphery , leaving only a few patches ( Fig . 6F ) . Lifeact - GFP persisted at the septum for 17 : 24 ± 0 : 42 min : s after time zero . Thus , it was present during septum formation for a total of 21 : 30 ± 1 : 42 min : s . 576 D . L . Delgado - Álvarez et al . / Fungal Genetics and Biology 47 ( 2010 ) 573 – 586 TPM - 1 - GFP localized at the contractile ring during septum for - mation . The ﬂuorescent signal of this protein appeared a few sec - onds before membrane invagination , and was already focused at that time as a sharp ring ( 0 : 27 ± 0 : 14 min : s ) ( Fig . 6C , Movie 8 ) . Similar to Lifeact - GFP , the TPM - 1 - GFP ring contracted with the membrane during septation until it almost reached the center of the hyphal diameter , and then disappeared ( Fig . 6C and G ) . After 9 : 56 ± 2 : 07 min : s , the ﬂuorescence vanished ( Fig . 6G ) . Comparable to Abd2 - GFP , scattered patches of FIM - GFP ( Fig . 6A , E and H ) and ARP - 3 - GFP ( data not shown ) accumulated around the hyphal perimeter at the site of septum development ( (cid:2) 0 : 13 ± 0 : 10 min : s ) . A cortical double ring of FIM - GFP patches ﬂanking the invaginated plasma membrane was revealed by FM4 - 64 staining and 3D reconstruction ( Fig . 6A and H , Movie 9 ) . An orthogonal view exposed that as the plasma membrane con - tracted , the patches also moved inward ( Fig . 6H , bottom row ) . When the septum was completed , the ﬂuorescent patches disap - peared from both faces of the septum ( 8 : 31 ± 2 : 49 min : s ) ( Fig . 6A ; time 9 : 48 and E ) . 3 . 6 . F - actin during branching At the onset of branch formation cortical Abd2 - GFP ( Fig . 7A , Mo - vie 9 ) and ARP - 3 - GFP ( data not shown ) patches subtending the branching site became associated laterally with the incipient branch . As the protruding branch emerged , these patches followed the contour of the developing branch ( Fig . 7A ) . Upon continued branch elongation , the continuity of the patches was broken and they resolved into two rings , one associated with each growth site Fig . 2 .

Simultaneous co - expression of ABPs We fused the N . crassa strains containing Lifeact - GFP and TPM - 1 - mchFP , in order to follow the relationship between these ABPs dur - ing apical growth and septum formation . In the hyphal apex there was a colocalization of both proteins in the Spk area ( Fig . 8A ) , although the TPM - 1 - mchFP occupied a central spot in the Lifeact - GFP accumulation ( Fig . 8B ) . During septum formation Lifeact - GFP appeared ﬁrst , followed by TPM - 1 - mchFP ( Fig . 8C ; see Section 3 . 5 . F - actin associated with septa ) . A 4D reconstruction revealed the appearanceanddistributionofbothproteins ( Fig . 8E ) .

Patch mobility To explore in more detail the behavior of the FIM - GFP , ARP - 3 - GFP and Lifeact - GFP patches , we performed TIRFM imaging .

The high temporal resolution of TIRFM allowed us to assess F - actin patch mobility . Patches moved independently from each other , either moving towards the apex ( anterograde motion ) or to the distal parts of the hyphae ( retrograde motion ) ( Fig . 9B and C , Movie 11 ) . Close to the apical region almost all the patches ( > 90 % ; n = 30 ) moved towards the apex , and in older parts of the mycelium the proportion exhibiting anterograde movements de - creased ( (cid:3) 70 % ; n = 30 ) .

Delgado - Álvarez et al . / Fungal Genetics and Biology 47 ( 2010 ) 573 – 586 579 their mobility in two general types : mobile patches and static patches . It is important to clarify that a single patch could exhibit both types of behavior . A static patch may suddenly become mo - bile and a moving patch may become a static patch . Patches were most often static , and such patches were distributed all throughout the cell . The speed of the patches labeled with Lifeact - GFP was 3 . 7 ± 0 . 2 l m s (cid:2) 1 and with FIM - GFP it was 3 . 0 ± 0 . 1 l m s (cid:2) 1 . Most of the patches that comprise the subapical ring are static ( Fig . 9A , Movie 11 ) . In the basal region , the majority of the patches are mo - bile with sudden fast movements that alternate with periods of no movement at all . The patches seemed to follow the tracks of corti - cal F - actin cables ( Fig . 9D , Movie 12 ) . Patches had an average lifetime of 5 . 2 ± 0 . 35 s ( n = 30 ) . Lifetime is deﬁned as the time the patches were visible . Some patches exhibited little or no lateral movement within a given focal plane before they move inwardly ( Fig . 9E and F ) , and some were dis - placed considerably before leaving the focal plane ( Fig . 9G – I ) . 3 . 9 . Depolymerization of the F - actin and microtubular cytoskeleton N . crassa expressing Abd2 - GFP , TPM - 1 - GFP , and ARP - 3 - GFP showed a disruption of the ﬂuorescent pattern of all markers when exposed to F - actin depolymerizing drugs , such as Cyt A and Lat A ( Fig . 10A ) . To address the distribution of F - actin structures in cells treated with anti - actin drugs , we observed two focal planes : the plane closer to the plasma membrane ( Fig . 10A ) and the middle plane ( Fig . 10B ) . In Abd2 - GFP and ARP - 3 - GFP , the subapical ring had disappeared and all the patches where scattered and reached the apical dome in both Cyt A and Lat A treatments ( Fig . 10B ) . Patch movement was severely diminished , although the patches did not disassemble ( Fig . 10A ) . In the strains tagged with TPM - 1 - GFP and Lifeact - GFP , neither cables nor the apical accumulation appeared . In the Lifeact - GFP strains only patches were visible after treatment ( Fig . 10A ) . Additionally , we exposed the different strains to benomyl a microtubule depolymerizing drug , Abd2 : : GFP patches motility was not affected , but they were misslocalized , the apical ring was not present and many patches accumulated in the apex ( Fig . 10B ) , TPM - 1 - GFP and Lifeact - GFP labeled thin cables were present in cells treated with benomyl ( Fig . 10A ) , Lifeact - GFP patches were spread in the apex and subapex ( Fig . 10B ) . Taken to - gether , our results suggest that the ABP reporters faithfully present actin motility in living cells , and that their movement is only mar - ginally disturbed by microtubule - depolymerizing drugs . 4 . Discussion In this study , we describe a set of in vivo F - actin reporters that have proven useful for the study of the actin cytoskeleton in N . crassa . We used the ABPs ﬁmbrin , tropomyosin , ARP - 2 , ARP - 3 , Fig . 7 . Abd2 - GFP and TPM - 1 - GFP during branch formation .

Delgado - Álvarez et al . / Fungal Genetics and Biology 47 ( 2010 ) 573 – 586 and Lifeact ( Riedl et al . , 2008 ) , all fused to the N - terminus of GFP as reporters for actin distribution . The truncated version of ﬁmbrin ( Abd2 ) is a good reporter as the full - length protein , because it dis - played the same distribution and dynamics . It retained the ability to bind to a speciﬁc population of actin ﬁlaments found in the cell cortex , similar to what has been shown in Arabidopsis thaliana root hairs ( Sheahan et al . , 2004 ; Wang et al . , 2004a ) , Our ﬁndings ex - tend recent observations made with live cell actin markers in A . nidulans germlings ( Upadhyay and Shaw , 2008 ; Taheri - Talesh et al . , 2008 ; Araujo - Bazán et al . , 2008 ) by analyzing actin dynamics in mature hyphae , emerging branches and developing septa of N . crassa . We found that different ABPs labeled different subsets of ac - tin structures , and we also identiﬁed a global marker for F - actin in this fungus ( Lifeact ) . 4 . 1 . Apical actin organizes the Spk Our ﬁndings on the localization of tropomyosin and Lifeact in the Spk are consistent with previous descriptions of actin in different fungi based on immuno - staining methods ( Bourett and Fig . 8 .

Discrete cables of F - actin were not observed in the Spk . Indeed , reports based on TEM describe F - actin organization as a dense meshwork in which other components of the Spk are embedded ( Howard , Fig . 9 . F - Actin patches in the cell cortex .

Delgado - Álvarez et al . / Fungal Genetics and Biology 47 ( 2010 ) 573 – 586 1981 ; Roberson and Fuller , 1988 ; Roberson et al . , 2010 ) . Contrac - tile forces within the Spk are needed not only to maintain its order , but also to promote movement . The spatial distribution of Spk ele - ments is maintained throughout apical growth ( Sharpless and Har - ris , 2002 ; Harris et al . , 2005 ; Li et al . , 2006 ) . It is highly likely that F - actin functions as the scaffold that regulates the distribution and motility of Spk components , which results in the efﬁcient control of the tip growth apparatus . This idea is supported by the ﬁnding that the polarisome and the Spk are disassembled following treat - ment with latrunculin or cytochalasin ( Araujo - Palomares et al . , 2009 ) . Tropomyosin may well be the protein for this function , as it has been shown to regulate the contact between F - actin and myosins , and also to stabilize actin ﬁlaments ( Pittenger et al . , 1994 ; Dos Remedios et al . , 2003 ) . 4 . 2 . Subapical actin patches aid endocytosis In the subapex , F - actin was found as a cortical ring of patches labeled by ﬁmbrin , ARP3 , and Lifeact . These actin patches closely resemble the actin structures revealed by rhodamine - phaloidin labeling in S . cerevisiae ( Adams and Pringle , 1981 ) and immunolo - calization with anti - actin antibodies in the ﬁlamentous fungi N . crassa ( Heath et al . , 2000 ) , Sclerotium rolfsii ( Roberson , 1992 ) , All - omyces macrogynus ( Srinivasan et al . , 1996 ) and Mucor rouxii ( Ha - sek and Bartnicki - Garcia , 1994 ) . In living germlings of A . nidulans , actin patches were labeled by FimA : GFP and ActA : GFP ( Upadhyay and Shaw , 2008 ) . In N . crassa , abundant actin patches were local - ized throughout the cell cortex . TIRFM demonstrated an abun - dance of cortical patches in the basal region of hyphae , which would have been difﬁcult , to ascertain by confocal microscopy , due to resolution limitations . F - actin patches were must abundant in the subapical region , which has been referred to as the endocytotic zone ( Upadhyay and Shaw , 2008 ; Araujo - Bazán et al . , 2008 ) . This accumulation is consistent with their known role in enodcytosis in S . cerevisiae , A . nidulans and Aspergillus oryzae . In S . cerevisiae studies of Sac6 ( ﬁm - brin ) null mutants revealed severe defects in the endocytic uptake of a - factor , demonstrating that ﬁmbrin is essential for endocytosis ( Kübler and Riezman , 1993 ; Geli and Riezman , 1998 ) . In addition , Sac6 labeled with GFP colocalized with the endocytic marker FM4 - 64 ( Huckaba et al . , 2004 ) . Similar to our ﬁndings , actin patches are resistant to depolymerization by anti - actin drugs in S . cerevisiae . Actin patches puriﬁed from a wild type strain of S . cerevisiae are resistant to actin depolymerization , whereas patches puriﬁed from sac6 D mutants are highly susceptible to anti - actin drugs , demonstrating that ﬁmbrin stabilizes actin patches in vitro ( Young et al . , 2004 ) . Therefore we propose that the actin patches we observed in N . crassa correspond to sites of endocytosis as they do in other fungi . We found a second type of F - actin array in the hyphal subapex tagged by tropomyosin - GFP and Lifeact - GFP , forming cables exclu - sively in the cell cortex . We were not able to detect cytoplasmic ac - tin cables , tagged either by tropomyosin - GFP or Lifeact - GFP , as reported in A . nidulans germlings ( Taheri - Talesh et al . , 2008 ) . Sur - prisingly , in A . nidulans the G - actin reporter ( ActA : GFP ) ( Taheri - Talesh et al . , 2008 ; Upadhyay and Shaw , 2008 ) does not label Fig . 10 . Confocal images of cells treated with actin inhibitors Cyt A and Lat A and microtubule inhibitor benomyl .

Delgado - Álvarez et al . / Fungal Genetics and Biology 47 ( 2010 ) 573 – 586 583 cables as Lifeact does in N . crassa . In contrast to F - actin patches , cables were highly sensitive to latrunculin and cytochalasin treat - ment in N . crassa . In ﬁlamentous fungi , F - actin cables may serve as the distribution tracks for myosin motor proteins transporting dif - ferent cargo ( e . g . secretory vesicles and mRNAs ) to the sites of growth and cell division as they do in yeasts ( Pruyne and Bretscher , 2000 ; Moseley and Goode , 2006 ) . 4 . 3 . ABPs form distinct rings during septum formation We observed F - actin in developing septa organized as a net - work of cables , two closely opposed rings of patches ﬂanking the septum , and a contractile ring . In a previous report ( Rasmussen and Glass , 2005 ) , actin immuno - localization revealed similar actin arrays in N . crassa either as single or double rings of patches or a large central accumulation . However , actin was not usually ob - served in mature septa . Our observations provide additional details regarding actin organization in developing septa in N . crassa , and the potential roles of different ABPs . The distribution of tropomyosin and Lifeact in developing septa suggests that these are good markers for the actomyosin contrac - tile ring . The contractile ring is formed during cytokinesis , but in N . crassa , where this process is typically incomplete , it results in hyphal compartmentalization . We observed F - actin labeled by Lifeact - GFP around 4 min before any evidence of plasma mem - brane invagination . Prior to invagination , actin appeared as a broad network of cables and patches ﬂanking the future site of septation . In S . pombe , cytokinesis starts with the assembly of a broad band of nodes containing a type II myosin Myo2 , Cdc4 and Rlc1 ( Wu et al . , 2003 , 2006 ; Pollard , 2008 ; Vavylonis et al . , 2008 ) . Nodes have not been observed in N . crassa , because these contractile ring compo - nents have not been studied , but we observed a coalescence of Life - act - GFP - tagged F - actin cables into a contractile ring that is reminiscent of the coalescence of nodes into a contractile ring ob - served in S . pombe ( Wu et al . , 2006 ) . A gradient of cortical tension that moves all components toward the site of cytokinesis has been proposed to explain the coalescence of contractile rings in yeast and animal cells ( White and Borisy , 1983 ; Wu et al . , 2006 ; Pollard , 2008 ; Vavylonis et al . , 2008 ) . As cytokinesis is a conserved process , we expect that contractile ring formation follows the same general principle in N . crassa . Our observations strengthen previous ﬁndings that Arp2 / 3 complex participates in late stages of septation but does not partic - ipate in the assembly of the contractile ring ( Wu and Pollard , 2005 ; Wu et al . , 2006 ) . The evidence supporting this is the appearance of patches labeled by ARP3 - GFP ( and FIM - GFP ) after contractile ring formation and ﬂanking the contractile ring a few seconds before ring contraction begins . Fimbrin and Arp2 / 3 complex - containing endocytic patches may contribute to membrane remodeling in the septum during its formation . Tropomyosin is also associated with the contractile ring but not in early stages . This protein seems to be recruited after the coalescence of Lifeact - GFP labeled cables into a sharp ring , a few seconds before the membrane contraction begins , as a part of the maturation of the contractile ring ( Pollard , 2008 ) . 4 . 4 . TIRFM reveals antero - and retrograde actin patch movement To extend our observations of patch behavior we used TIRFM , a technique that allows the visualization of ﬂuorophores close to the specimen / cover glass interphase . TIRFM also allows higher tempo - ral resolution , lower photobleaching and signiﬁcantly reduces background ﬂuorescence . The high temporal resolution permitted us to assess the motility of cortical patches . We found that in N . crassa , patch movement can be either anterograde or retrograde as has been observed in S . cerevisiae , S . pombe ( Pelham and Chang , 2001 ; Smith et al . , 2001 ; Carlsson et al . , 2002 ; Huckaba et al . , 2004 ) and A . nidulans ( Upadhyay and Shaw , 2008 ) . As demonstrated in S . cerevisiae ( Huckaba et al . , 2004 ) and in S . pombe ( Pelham and Chang , 2001 ) , patch movement in the surface plane in N . crassa seems to be via F - actin cables , since treatment with latrunculin and cytochalasin stopped patch movement . The actin patch speed measured in N . crassa ( 3 . 35 l m s (cid:2) 1 ) is the highest reported for fungal cells , an order of magnitude higher than those reported for A . nidulans ( 0 . 19 – 0 . 56 l m s (cid:2) 1 ) ( Upadhyay and Shaw , 2008 ) or the yeasts S . cerevisiae ( 0 . 31 l m s (cid:2) 1 ) and S . pombe ( 0 . 3 l m s (cid:2) 1 ) ( Waddle et al . , 1996 ; Carlsson et al . , 2002 ) . While patches move at high speed , the patch lifetimes of N . crassa ( 5 . 2 s ) are signiﬁcantly shorter than those reported for A . nidulans or S . cerevisiae . AbpA - labeled patches in A . nidulans have an average lifetime of 24 s ( Araujo - Bazán et al . , 2008 ) and Abp1 - labeled patches in S . cerevisiae had an average lifetime of about 15 s ( Huck - aba et al . , 2004 ) . The difference in lifetime measurements may be related to the microscopy technique used in each case . Our study employed TIRFM where the optical slice is (cid:3) 100 nm , whereas with other techniques including confocal microscopy the smallest opti - cal slice is 700 nm . Thus , TIRFM allows more accurate determina - tion of the timing of patch dissociation from the plasma membrane . 5 . Summary Actin is one of the most abundant proteins in eukaryotes and plays a major role in diverse cellular functions . The associations of actin with other proteins in ﬁlamentous fungi are not well understood . Reliable reporters for the complete actin population and its various subsets are needed in order to address some of the key questions about actin function in polarized growth and development . We evaluated seven different actin reporters that to - gether label a wide range of actin arrays in mature hyphae of N . crassa . Each array is associated with particular actin - binding pro - teins that presumably participate in the regulation of its localiza - tion , dynamics and function .
