Our aim was to develop an online tool to draw survival plots , which can be used to assess the rele - vance of the expression levels of various genes on the clinical outcome both in untreated and treated breast cancer patients . A background database was established using gene expression data and survival information of 1 , 809 patients downloaded from GEO ( Affymetrix HGU133A and HGU133 ? 2 microarrays ) . The median relapse free survival is 6 . 43 years , 968 / 1 , 231 patients are estrogen - receptor ( ER ) positive , and 190 / 1 , 369 are lymph - node positive . After quality control and normalization only probes present on both Affymetrix platforms were retained ( n = 22 , 277 ) . In order to analyze the prognostic value of a particular gene , the cohorts are divided into two groups according to the median ( or upper / lower quartile ) expres - sion of the gene . The two groups can be compared in terms of relapse free survival , overall survival , and distant metastasis free survival . A survival curve is displayed , and the hazard ratio with 95 % conﬁdence intervals and logrank P value are calculated and displayed . Additionally , three subgroups of patients can be assessed : systematically untreated patients , endocrine - treated ER positive patients , and patients with a distribution of clinical characteristics representative of those seen in general clinical practice in the US .

We used this integrative data analysis tool to conﬁrm the prognostic power of the proliferation - related genes TOP2A and TOP2B , MKI67 , CCND2 , CCND3 , CCNDE2 , as well as CDKN1A , and TK2 . We also validated the capability of microarrays to determine estrogen receptor status in 1 , 231 patients . The tool is highly valuable for the preliminary assessment of biomarkers , especially for research groups with limited bioinformatic resources . Keywords Survival analysis (cid:2) Breast cancer (cid:2) Prognosis Background Biomarkers are a readily measurable set of parameters with directly applicable information on the clinical course of cancer . The ﬁrst biomarkers were established at the cellu - lar , histological , or whole organism level .

With the introduction of biomarkers such as estrogen receptor and HER2 in evaluating the clinical course of breast cancer , biomarker discovery has shifted toward a more molecular level with a large number of individual gene or protein expression levels being tested . To date numerous additional genes have been suggested as being capable to predict prognosis in breast cancer [ 4 ] . This shift has also been further investigated by the fact that qualita - tive biomarkers are usually difﬁcult to assess in a consis - tent fashion ; e . g . , the concordance of tumor grade assessments by three independent pathologists is less than 50 % [ 5 ] . Following the identiﬁcation of new gene expression - based biomarkers various steps of independent validations must be completed . While direct measurement of gene expression levels , e . g . , by QRT – PCR , is the most reliable method to do this ; it is often desirable to test few candidate genes without major further investment in order to choose the most promising candidates and eliminate those that are most likely to fail . Microarray cohorts combined with appropriate clinical data offer exactly such a cost effective tool to prescreen potential new biomarkers . The accuracy of microarray - based gene expression measurements has been evaluated by a wide array of diverse studies [ 6 – 8 ] , leading to the general conclusion that it is a powerful surveyor of gene expression changes when its limitations are considered properly . While absolute gene expression levels are hard to estimate , relative gene expression levels can be measured in a consistent fashion ; therefore , a preliminary test to evaluate prognostic bio - markers based on their relative gene expression levels is a prudent exploitation of already existing clinical microarray cohorts . The Kaplan – Meier estimator ( also known as the product limit estimator ) estimates the survival function from life - time data . An important beneﬁt of the Kaplan – Meier curve is that the method takes into account ‘‘censored’’ data— losses from the cohort before the ﬁnal outcome is observed ( for instance , if a patient withdraws from a study ) . When no truncation or censoring occurs , the Kaplan – Meier curve is equivalent to the empirical distribution [ 9 ] . The associ - ation between a clinical parameter ( or biomarker ) and survival can be visualized by drawing a Kaplan – Meier plot in which patients are split into groups according to the parameter . Our aim was to use the data generated in gene expres - sion studies to develop an online survival analysis tool that can be used to assess the effect of single genes on breast cancer prognosis . Since many of the current ASCO pro - posed proliferation - related genes [ 10 ] do not hold sufﬁcient evidence to be introduced in clinical practice , we also aimed to assess the effect of their expression on survival . Finally , we evaluated the capability of microarray data to predict estrogen receptor ( ER ) status . Methods A database was established using gene expression data downloaded from GEO . For this , the keywords ‘‘breast’’ , ‘‘cancer’’ , ‘‘gpl96’’ , and ‘‘gpl570’’ were used in GEO ( http : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov / geo / ) . Only publications with available raw data , clinical survival information , and at least 30 patients were included . Only Affymetrix HG - U133A ( GPL96 ) and HG - U133 Plus 2 . 0 ( GPL570 ) microarrays were considered , because they are frequently used and because these two particular arrays have 22 , 277 probe sets in common . The use of nearly identical platforms is important since different platforms for gene - expression proﬁling measure expression of the same gene with varying precision , on different relative scales , and with different dynamic ranges [ 11 ] . An overview of the clinical data is presented on Table 1 . After an initial quality control , redundant samples ( n = 384 ) were excluded [ 12 ] . The raw CEL ﬁles were MAS5 normalized in the R statistical environment ( www . r - project . org ) using the affy Bioconductor library [ 13 ] . MAS5 can be applied to individual chips , making future extensions of the database uncomplicated . Moreover , MAS5 ranked among the best normalization methods when com - pared to the results of RT - PCR measurements in our recent study [ 8 ] . Then , only probes measured on both GPL96 and GPL570 were retained ( n = 22 , 277 ) . At this stage , we performed a second scaling normalization to set the average expression on each chip to 1 , 000 to avoid batch effects [ 14 ] . The Kaplan – Meier plotter is set up using a central server which can be reached over the internet . The background database is handled by a MySQL server , which integrates gene expression and clinical data simultaneously . Data is loaded into the R statistical environment , where calcula - tions are performed . The package ‘‘survival’’ is used to calculate and plot Kaplan – Meier survival curves , and the number - at - risk is indicated below the main plot . Hazard ratio ( and 95 % conﬁdence intervals ) and logrank P are calculated and displayed . The user receives the feedback over the webpage . The system is summarized on Fig . 1 . In order to determine expression of the ER gene ESR1 , we used the results from Gong et al . [ 15 ] , who found that the probe set 205225 _ at had the highest mean and median expression values , the greatest range of expression values , and the strongest correlation with clinical ER status , and was therefore suggested for future ESR1 determinations . We also used their suggested threshold of 500 to determine ER status of the samples . 726 Breast Cancer Res Treat ( 2010 ) 123 : 725 – 731 123 When comparing data from Surveillance , Epidemiology , and End Results ( SEER ) , the population - based tumor reg - istry program of the National Cancer Institute [ 16 ] to the overall characteristics of the patients used in our analysis ( only patients with all available clinical data ) , some dif - ferences were observed . These differences could inﬂuence actual results when interpreting the resulting Kaplan – Meier plot . Therefore , a randomization algorithm - selected set of patients of similar , over - represented clinical characteristics were removed in making an additional ﬁlter for the analysis . Results We identiﬁed 1 , 809 unique patients meeting our criteria in GEO . The median relapse free survival is 6 . 43 years , 968 / 1 , 231 patients are estrogen - receptor positive by histologi - cal or radioimmunoassay based evaluation , and 190 / 1 , 369 are lymph - node positive . Furthermore , 1 , 593 patients have relapsed free survival data , 594 have overall survival data and 767 have distant metastasis free survival data . In order to analyze the association between a queried gene and survival , the samples are grouped according to the median ( or upper or lower quartile ) expression of the selected gene , and then the two groups are compared by a Kaplan – Meier plot . Before running the analysis , the patients can be ﬁltered using ER status , lymph node status , and / or grade . Additionally , as an alternative to relapse free sur - vival , overall survival and distant metastasis free survival can be employed . The web address is www . kmplot . com . Many of the published microarray cohorts used patient selection criteria corresponding to the goals of the partic - ular study . Therefore , the patients in our database may not be representative of breast cancer patients in general . Users of our service may be interested how a given gene is associated with outcome in a general ‘‘all comer’’ cohort , as might be seen in the everyday clinical practice . For this we established a patient cohort similar to SEER published prevalences . The eliminated samples were ER positive , node negative patients in all three grades from different datasets . The resulting reduced database includes 500 patients , and the prevalences of the individual breast cancer subtypes and clinical parameters are similar to the actual US prevalence numbers ( Table 2 ) . A clinician might be interested in a speciﬁc clinical question related to the treatment of the patients . Therefore , we established two options for additional ﬁltering : the ﬁrst cohort represents a truly prognostic setting ( e . g . , systemi - cally untreated patients , n = 809 ) and the second cohort the endocrine - treated ER positive patients ( n = 414 ) . The ER status as determined by IHC was available for 1 , 231 patients , which we used to assess the efﬁcacy of ER T a b l e 1 C li n i ca l p r op e r ti e s o f t h e m i c r o a rr a y d a t a s e t s u s e d i n t h e a n a l y s i s G E O I D P l a t f o r m E R ?

The ER - positive samples ( n = 968 ) had a markedly higher expression of the ESR1 gene than did the ER negative samples ( n = 263 ) . On Fig . 2 , we illustrate the distribution of ER positive and ER negative samples as measured by microarray and IHC . 90 . 2 % of the ER positive ( 945 out of 1 , 048 ) , and 89 . 8 % of ER negative ( 160 out of 183 ) predictions were correct . Markers of cell proliferation have been proposed and evaluated as prognostic factors in breast cancer . We com - puted Kaplan – Meier plots for the markers Ki67 , cyclin D , cyclin E , the cyclin inhibitors p27 and p21 , thymidine kinase , and topoisomerase II to assess their effect on prognosis ( Table 3 ; Fig . 3 ) .

In our study , we combined raw data from several studies ; this enabled us to treat the data as a single dataset which makes the use of existing algorithms directly applicable . By combining multiple datasets the statistical power is dramatically increased . Prior to our study , no suitable tool was available which could help to estimate the prognostic value of any selected gene in a large cohort of clinical patients . In our service , after dividing the patients into two groups based on the expression of the selected gene , a Kaplan – Meier plot is generated . In this , 1 , 809 patient are used all together , of which 1 , 593 have relapse free survival data , 594 have overall survival data , and 767 have distant metastasis free survival data . As our service performs the requested anal - ysis in real time on the original data , the extension of the analysis ( e . g . , the inclusion of additional samples or ﬁl - tering for other clinical parameters ) will be easily feasible in the future . Since gene expression arrays might be used to conﬁrm ER status , we implemented an estimation of ER status based on gene expression data . Previous studies have shown signiﬁcant correlation between mRNA concentra - tions and routinely established ( IHC based ) clinical ER status [ 17 – 19 ] . In the study of Gong et al . [ 15 ] the same platform was used as in our study . They used immuno - histochemistry to independently measure the ER status and to establish a statistical threshold for ESR1 mRNA level to assign ER status to tumor samples . They suggested using an ESR1 mRNA cutoff value of 500 to identify ER positive status with an overall accuracy of 90 % . By using the above threshold in the 1 , 231 patients with available ER status data , we also achieved overall accuracy of 90 % . Thus , we conﬁrmed the capability to use microarrays to measure ER status . Because we performed a second scaling normali - zation , the original MAS5 expression values ( as used in the study of Gong et al . ) were slightly transformed . However , this transformation made it possible to compare gene expression measurements made on two different micro - array platforms .

Another important clinical question is the use of pro - liferation - genes to predict prognosis in breast cancer patients . A previous analysis of 32 papers could not allow the inclusion of these markers on the list of ASCO - approved standard prognostic and predictive factors due to methodological problems [ 10 ] . In order to clarify these contradictory results , we computed Kaplan – Meier plots for the markers ( MKI67 , CCND1 , CCND2 , CCND3 , CCNE1 , CCNE2 , CDKN1B , CDKN1A , TK1 , TK2 , TOP2A , and TOP2B ) to assess their effect on prognosis . We can conﬁrm the prognostic value of MKI67 , CCND2 , CCND3 , CCNE2 , and CDKN1A , as well as TK2 . Both TOP2A and TOP2B had a very high predictive power . However , the results of CCND1 , CCNE1 , CDKN1B , and TK1 were ( although par - tially signiﬁcant ) not convincing . Therefore , we suggest the use of above prognostic genes as measured using microarrays . We must note a limitation of our approach : the use of the median ( or upper / lower quartile ) sample for dividing the samples into high - and low - expression groups . In principle , a cutoff - free correlation analysis of gene expression and survival data is possible using Cox pro - portional hazard models . In this frame work , signiﬁcance and hazard ratio could be assessed , but no survival curves for a good and a poor prognosis group could be drawn . The advantage of the use of the median for splitting is the negligible effect of outliers , which—due to the high dynamic range of the microarrays—could seriously skew the results when using the mean . Moreover , median enables to have high - and low - expression groups of virtu - ally the same size which enables the drawing of robust Kaplan – Meier plot . The determination of an exact cutoff value for each transcript could improve the results . How - ever , in this case the expression should be conﬁrmed by independent methods like RT – PCR or immunohistochem - istry to achieve a reliable correlation . Such a ﬁne - tuning— as it has been done for the ESR1 gene in ovarian cancer [ 20 ] —must be performed for each gene individually and is therefore not in the scope of present study . Finally , we added a visual enhancement to the service to help to select the probe sets with the best quality . The individual probes on the probe selection drop - down menu have background color , which represents the estimated quality of the probe set : green = excellent ( average expression of the probe set in the 1 , 809 patients is over 500 ) , red = not reliable ( average expression \ 100 and maximal expression \ 500 ) , yellow = intermediate ( all other probes ) . In summary , we developed a web service which is capable evaluating the prognostic utility of 22 , 277 genes in 1 , 809 breast cancer patients and speciﬁcally used this tool to evaluate the effect of the proliferation - related genes in breast cancer prognosis . The integrative genomic analysis Fig . 3 The good prognostic effect of the over expression TK2 ( a 204227 _ s _ at ) and the lower expression of TOP2A ( b 201292 _ at ) are highly signiﬁcant . The expression of Cyclin D1 is not correlated to prognosis at all ( c 208712 _ at ) 730 Breast Cancer Res Treat ( 2010 ) 123 : 725 – 731 123 is still evolving ; thus future integration of additional forms of data such as sequence , location , or copy number varia - tions might potentially add vital additional information which will enable us to deliver higher accuracy in prog - nosis prediction .
