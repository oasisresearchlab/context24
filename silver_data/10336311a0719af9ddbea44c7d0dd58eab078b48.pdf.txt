In particular , cells can adapt their shape according to the availability of ECM proteins , e . g . , ﬁ bronectin ( FN ) . Several in vitro experiments usually simulate the ECM by functionalizing the surfaces on which cells grow with FN . However , the mechanisms underlying cell spreading on non - uniformly FN - coated two - dimensional substrates are not clari ﬁ ed yet . In this work , we studied cell spreading on variously functionalized substrates : FN was either uniformly distributed or selectively patterned on ﬂ at surfaces , to show that A549 , BRL , B16 and NIH 3T3 cell lines are able to sense the overall FN binding sites independently of their spatial arrangement . Instead , only the total amount of available FN in ﬂ uences cells spreading area , which positively correlates to the FN density . Immunocytochemical analysis showed that β 1 integrin subunits are mainly responsible for this behaviour , as further con ﬁ rmed by spreading experiments with β 1 - de ﬁ cient cells . In the latter case , indeed , cells areas do not show a dependency on the amount of available FN on the substrates . Therefore , we envision for β 1 a predominant role in cells for sensing the number of ECM ligands with respect to other focal adhesion proteins .

In vivo , cell adhesion , migration , and differentiation are predominantly in ﬂ uenced by the differential organisation of the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) . A variety of factors are involved in shaping the mechano - signaling response , ranging from the architecture and stiffness of the ECM to the type and density of ECM proteins . Several studies have indicated how mechanical features of the cellular environment play a role in determining the dynamics of focal adhesions ( FAs ) , which in turn activate regulatory pathways involved in cell mobility , proliferation and differentiation ( Stutchbury et al . , 2017 ; Matellan and del R ı ó Hernández , 2019 ) . FAs are multi - protein complexes consisting of ECM - ligands , transmembrane receptors and more than 160 different intracellular scaffold and signalling proteins ( Geiger et al . , 2009 ) . They dynamically enter and leave the cell adhesion complex , depending on the function and maturation of the cell - matrix adhesion structure . Among different types of cell surface receptors that can interact with components of the extracellular matrix , the integrin family is one of the most important for the cell - ECM connection ( Bachmann et al . , 2019 ) . Integrins are heterodimeric proteins consisting of the α and β subunits , each presenting variants which lead to more than twenty integrin types . Integrin - dependent cell - matrix adhesions are not just the physical connection to the ECM , but also transmit signals and forces from the extracellular environment into the cell by outside - in signalling ( Matthews et al . , 2006 ; Xia and Kanchanawong , 2017 ; Kechagia et al . , 2019 ; Sun et al . , 2019 ) . Cell adhesion and subsequent spreading are essential for the growth and function of adherent cells . The cell spreading process on ECM - coated surfaces requires a recognition and signalling component and depends on building the cell / ECM contacts and its dynamics , as well as on the subsequent reorganization of actin cytoskeleton and generation of actomyosin contractility ( Murrell et al . , 2015 ) . The spreading process is a continuous event ( Brill - Karniely et al . , 2014 ) that consist of three phases ( Döbereiner et al . , 2004 ; Frame and Norman , 2008 ) : 1 ) building of cell / ECM contact , which might be integrin - independent ; 2 ) fast increase of the contact area involving assembly of focal complex and the FAK - dependent spreading ; 3 ) stabilization and maybe polarization of the cell characterized by Rho - induced contraction and formation of stable adhesion . How cells sense the physical properties of the environment ( e . g . , elasticity ) is extensively reviewed ( Geiger et al . , 2009 ; Yang et al . , 2017 ) , but not much is yet known about how cells count and integrate the amount of the ECM molecules in their surroundings . Cell - spreading experiments on planar surfaces with varying physical parameters ( e . g . , rigid or elastic ) and homogenously coated with different concentration of the studied protein show different relationships between cell size and the density of supplied ligands . This has led to the generally accepted conclusion that cell response to increased ECM - density is quite variable according to experimental conditions . Cell spreading can be a biphasic process characterized by reaching a maximum at an optimal ECM coating density and smaller cell size at lower ECM densities ( Rajagopalan et al . , 2004 ; Le Saux et al . , 2011 ) . Alternatively , it has also been reported that cell size just increases with increasing ligand density to reach a maximum constant value ( Dubin - Thaler et al . , 2004 ) . These degree of spreading showed to be dependent also on substrates stiffness , which is another parameter able to in ﬂ uence cell area ( Tee et al . , 2011 ) , potentially due to the consolidation phase of the spreading process . In this latter case , an optimal balance between substrate stiffness in ﬂ uencing the signalling response and ECM ligand density which determines the connectivity leads to maximal spreading ( Engler et al . , 2003 ) . However , not only the aforementioned variables but also the geometrical distribution of ECM ligands play a role in the cell behaviour . As the techniques to pattern ECM proteins on substrates improve ( Li et al . , 2019 ) , it has been possible to show that the geometry of ligand distribution is essential for cell growth ( Théry et al . , 2006 ) and differentiation ( Wang et al . , 2019 ) . Moreover , surface patterning represents a different route to vary ligand density on the substrate surface in alternative , or addition , to ECM protein dilution . In this case , the local density of the ligand remains maximal , but the average number of molecules per unit area may decrease according to the spacing of the functionalized patterns , both at the micro - ( Lehnert et al . , 2004 ) and at the nano - scale ( Deeg et al . , 2011 ; Zarka et al . , 2019 ) . In this case , a monotonically increasing cell size has been reported ( Lehnert et al . , 2004 ) . However , a comprehensive overview of how cells arrange their area in response to 1 ) chemically diluted and 2 ) geometrically distributed ECM molecules in systematically de ﬁ ned experimental conditions is , to the best of our knowledge , still missing . Here , we studied the capability of several cell lines to sense the amount of ECM ligands on ﬂ at and micropatterned substrates and to adjust their spreading accordingly . In comparison to other approaches ( Cavalcanti - Adam et al . , 2008 ; Satav et al . , 2015 ) , our investigation clari ﬁ es the impact of ﬁ bronectin ( FN ) density variation , due to both 1 ) dilution and 2 ) geometrical patterning . A direct correlation between FN availability and cell spreading area was observed . Depending on the cell line , spreading area values saturated after a de ﬁ ned amount of FN . Interestingly , the cell spreading was similar both when FN density was chemically controlled ( i . e . , via dilution on ﬂ at surfaces with denatured FN ) and when it was geometrically regulated ( i . e . , via controlled patterning of FN micro - islands ) , and the monotonic increase was independent on the patterning technique . In all cases , the β 1 integrin subunit showed to be Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin . org 02 Lemma et al . 10 . 3389 / fbioe . 2022 . 964259 responsible for the sensing of the FN amount , being distributed on all cell / substrate interfaces . This ﬁ nding was con ﬁ rmed by assessing the spreading of β 1 - de ﬁ cient cells , whose area resulted to be independent on the FN amount . Furthermore , GD25 - wt cells which were transfected to stably express the canonical β 1A integrin isoform , namely GD25 - β 1A , again showed a correlation between FN and spreading area . Moreover , the distribution of several FA - related proteins was investigated to infer their role in sensing the ECM amount on ﬂ at and patterned substrates . Our results are also compatible with the mechanosensing - mechanosignalling model proposed by Stutchbury et al . ( 2017 ) .

Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin . org 03 Lemma et al . 10 . 3389 / fbioe . 2022 . 964259 Results Cell area monotonically correlates to different ligand density and substrate patterning In order to establish a possible correlation between FN coverage of the substrates and cells area , two strategies were followed ( Figure 1A ) . The ﬁ rst approach consisted in sequential dilutions of FN on ﬂ at glass substrates . These were obtained by mixing FN as received ( aFN ) at a concentration of 10 μ g / ml with an appropriate amount of denatured FN ( dFN ) also at a concentration of 10 μ g / ml . In this way , it was possible to maintain the total number of FN molecules adsorbed on the substrates surface at a constant value of approximately 1000 molecules / µm 2 23 ; however , the eventual presence in the mixture of denatured FN molecules allowed for an effective reduction of the available binding sites for integrins ( Supplementary Figure S1 ) . The second experimental condition to assess the spreading behaviour of cells in presence of controlled amounts of FN consisted in realizing microenvironments on which FN was not homogeneously distributed , but rather patterned at de ﬁ ned distances . As the cellular mechanosensing may be studied by using several technologies ( Ermis et al . , 2018 ) , we also addressed the question whether the micropatterning technique plays a signi ﬁ cant role in cell spreading . We therefore used microcontact printing ( µCP ) and two - photon lithography ( 2PL ) to realize geometrical patterns of aFN on 2D surfaces . Brie ﬂ y , µCP is a soft - lithography technique which allows for serial replication of microstructures from a master stamp ( Hu et al . , 2018 ) of several differently inter - spaced islands of aFN . 2PL instead , is a direct laser writing technique which allows for rapid prototyping of two - and three - dimensional microstructures and patterns ( Hippler et al . , 2019 ; Lemma et al . , 2019 ) . In the case of 2PL , the patterned surfaces were realized following a two - step procedure : ﬁ rstly , a patterned substrate was fabricated with a FN - repulsive material , and subsequently the areas to be functionalized were fabricated with FN - adhesive polymeric photosensitive material ( PETA , see methods section for details ) . In particular , two pillar - based patterns were designed to allow a ﬁ nal FN - covered area of ≈ 60 % and ≈ 5 % of the overall surface ( Supplementary Figures 2A , B ) . Independently of the technique used for patterning , in order to avoid possible interference due to serum - adsorbed ECM molecules cells were seeded on the substrates in serum - free medium , after 1 - h protein coating . After 3 h from seeding , cell spreading was complete and cell areas were plotted against the dilution - or pattern - induced FN availability . Figures 1B , C show the cell area vs . aFN availability for A549 human lung cancer cells and NIH 3T3 mouse ﬁ broblasts on ﬂ at and patterned substrates via µCP and 2PL , respectively . Interestingly , for ﬂ at substrates a clear monotonic trend is shown . In particular , cell area ranged between a minimum value of ≈ 500 µm 2 for 5 % aFN density and a maximum value of ≈ 1800 µm 2 for A549 cells and of ≈ 1400 µm 2 for NIH 3T3 . The maximum value plateaus are reached at approximately 50 % aFN dilution for A549 and at approximately 20 % for NIH 3T3 . This suggests that different cell lines show different saturation values for cell areas , as also shown by dilution experiments for buffalo rat liver ( BRL ) and mouse melanoma ( B16 ) cells ( Supplementary Figure 3A ) . A similar monotonic increase in cell areas is also observed on micropatterned surfaces , where µCP aFN islands and 2PL - fabricated micro - pillar patterns only allowed for limited stretching of cells in a geometrical - patterning - dependent fashion ( from ≈ 500 µm 2 to ≈ 1750 µm 2 for A549 cells , and from ≈ 300 μ m 2 to ≈ 900 µm 2 for NIH 3T3 , Figures 1B , C ) . As a control for the suitability of the materials used in 2PL for cell area measurements , NIH 3T3 cells were also cultured on ﬂ at squares of 200 µm × 200 µm ( width x length ) with diluted FN ( Supplementary Figure 3B ) , showing again a clear monotonic trend saturating at ≈ 20 % of FN availability , similar to the one reported in Figure 1C . Smaller spreading areas measured on 2PL - fabricated squares might be due to the higher Young´s modulus of glass with respect to PETA ( Lemma et al . , 2017 ) , despite both substrates provide stiffness values compatible with certain physiological environments such as bone surfaces ( Akhmanova et al . , 2015 ) . However , the relative increase of cell area between the 5 % aFN dilution and the 100 % aFN coverage is similar in both cases ( ≈ 61 % for bare glass , ≈ 65 % for PETA substrates ) . Given the similarity of results for the two patterning techniques ( i . e . , µCP and 2PL ) , in the following both were used independently for further investigation steps . In general , the versatility of µCP allows for modulating FN islands in a wider range with respect to 2PL , especially for low geometrical densities , while the realization of the master stamps requires longer procedures in comparison to 2PL . Patterned or diluted ligand density induce similar cell spreading The strategies introduced in the previous paragraph for controlling surface aFN density , i . e . , dilution with dFN and micro - patterning , were then combined to assess whether cells were able to recognize the total amount of available aFN . In particular , patterns made via µCP were functionalized not only with aFN , but also with several mixing ratios of aFN and dFN , respectively . Cell area measurements highlighted that the monotonic cell area increase takes also place in these functionalization conditions for the previously used epithelial cell line A549 , and mesenchymal cell lines like BRL or B16 ( Figures 2A – C ) . A statistical analysis showed that cell areas on patterns quantitatively resemble areas on Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin . org 04 Lemma et al . 10 . 3389 / fbioe . 2022 . 964259 ﬂ at substrates with a comparable amount of aFN ( dotted and continuous circles in Figure 2A ) . Thus , if for a given cell line the spreading area reaches a plateau at 50 % aFN on ﬂ at substrates ( e . g . , for A549 and BRL ) , then lower amounts of aFN will induce the same spreading either 1 ) by further dilution with dFN , or indifferently 2 ) by further patterning , FIGURE 2 Cell spreading depends on FN availability . The aFN dilution and the geometrical pattern approaches were merged to show that the cell spreading areas have the same trend independently in both cases . Representative cells for 50 % aFN dilution on ﬂ at surfaces ( continuous circle ) and undiluted aFN on 50 % patterns ( dotted circles ) are shown on the right of each cell area graph . Average cell spreading area values indicated in dotted and continuous circles are statistically non - signi ﬁ cant . ( A ) : A549 cells . ( B ) : BRL cells . ( C ) : B16 cells . Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin . org 05 Lemma et al . 10 . 3389 / fbioe . 2022 . 964259 given that the ﬁ nal density of aFN per unit area is the same . This behaviour was shown to be valid independently on the threshold at which the plateau is reached ( e . g . , B16 cells ) , and suggests that cell mechanosensing during spreading acts independently of how the underlying ECM protein is distributed , but only considers the total amount of protein which can be used by cells for FAs . β 1 integrin is ubiquitous in focal adhesions on patterned substrates The α 5 β 1 integrin is also known as “ ﬁ bronectin receptor ” due to the speci ﬁ city of the β 1 subunit to bind the RGD sequence of FN . For this reason , it is hypothesized that β 1 integrin has a central role in sensing the total amount of FN molecules on the FIGURE 3 Cell spreading is β 1 - mediated . ( A ) β 1 integrin is detected centrally and peripherally on patterns , independently on aFN dilution , fabrication system and cell line . ( B ) Other proteins involved on FAs are detected only peripherally ( FAK , paxillin , pFAK ) , or centrally and peripherally ( talin ) . FN - coated patterns are red - coloured for eye guidance . Scalebar 20 µm . Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin . org 06 Lemma et al . 10 . 3389 / fbioe . 2022 . 964259 substrates . Thus , the β 1 subunit in NIH 3T3 cells in different conditions of aFN dilution and patterning was stained . On ﬂ at substrates , the β 1 ﬂ uorescence signal was diffusely distributed in the cells , with a certain clustering at peripheral FAs , independently of the aFN density ( Supplementary Figure 4A ) . However , patterns reveal that β 1 is indeed ubiquitously present within FAs . Indeed , Figure 3A shows that β 1 is present on all the micro - islands and micro - pillars on which cells spread , where the local density of aFN is highest . Once again , the observation is independent 1 ) on the amount of aFN dilution , 2 ) on the cell line , and 3 ) on the patterning technique . Furthercon ﬁ rmationof this behaviourwasobtained by analysing another set of patterns , namely 25 × 25 µm areas also obtained with 2PL . They were either 1 ) ﬂ at and functionalized with 100 % aFN , or 2 ) patterned with micro - pillars to achieve a ≈ 60 % aFN density per unit area when incubated with undiluted aFN ( Supplementary Figures 4B , C ) . In this case , NIH 3T3 cells spanned over the whole available area and could not spread further , as the structures are surrounded by passivating TPETA . Thus , cell area was restricted to 625 µm 2 , yet β 1 integrin was distributed both in the periphery and in the centre of cells ( Supplementary Figures 4D , E ) . This observation is expected , and interestingly shows that β 1 integrin ubiquitous location is not affected by the several single - cell and collective behaviours related to mechanosensing and mechanosignalling under physical constraints ( Toyjanova et al . , 2015 ; Ladoux and Mège , 2017 ; Mamidi et al . , 2018 ) . The importance of β 1 for sensing the amount of available aFN was further supported by the results of immunohistochemical staining of other proteins involved in the mechanotransduction pathway . Indeed , the mechanosensing machinery of cells comprises a number of proteins which mainly 1 ) provide the physical link between the FAs and the actin cytoskeleton , and 2 ) activate signalling pathways ( e . g . , the Rho / ROCK pathway ) which lead to cytoskeleton rearrangements and ultimately to cell migration ( Stutchbury et al . , 2017 ) . Integrins alone are not suf ﬁ cient to induce a reaction to biomechanical cues in cells , but their role should be evaluated in the context of the other FAs proteins ( Jansen et al . , 2017 ) . Thus , FAK , pFAK , paxillin , phosphorylated paxillin , kindlin2 , α - actinin , talin and vinculin distribution in cells spread on substrates was studied . Most of them mainly showed a peripheral distribution on patterns ( Figure 3B and Supplementary Figure 5 ) . Only talin was ubiquitously distributed on cell / substrate contacts ( Figure 3B ) , i . e . , it was co - localized with β 1 , which is in agreement with models describing talin as a binding protein between actin ﬁ bres and integrins , together with vinculin ( Humphries et al . , 2007 ; Critchley and Gingras , 2008 ) . GD25 - wt cells do not show area vs . ligand density correlation , in contrast to GD25 - β 1A Given the evidence that cells use β 1 integrin to build up FAs in correspondence of sites of aFN availability , a further step in the comprehension of FN sensing mechanisms was achieved by performing the aforementioned cell area measurements with a β 1 - de ﬁ cient cell line , namely GD25 - wt ( Wennerberg et al . , 1996 ) . In order to account for the presumable reduced motility and spreading capability due to the absence of β 1 , cells were in this case cultured for 6 h and in DMEM with serum : cell area showed no increase with higher aFN availability , either in the case of dilution or geometrical patterning ( Figure 4A , controls on 200 µm × 200 µm PETA squares at different aFN dilutions , and 3 - h culture controls in DMEM without serum are shown in Supplementary Figures 6A , B ) . In the GD25 - β 1A clone ( Wennerberg et al . , 1996 ) , the β 1 subunit is stably re - expressed . Relatedly , the monotonical increasing trend in cell area was re - established ( Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure 6C ) . In addition , β 1 integrin showed a similar distribution as in the previously used cell lines ( see also Supplementary Figure 6D ) . In order to directly compare experimental conditions between GD25 lines , also GD25 - β 1A cells were cultured for 6 h in DMEM with serum . Indeed , 3 - h - lasting seeding shows not convincing results ( Supplementary Figure 5E ) , thus strengthening the previous hypothesis that engineering β 1 expression in GD25 cells induces these cells to form FAs and to spread over substrates slower than other immortalized cell lines . As a control , NIH 3T3 cells were also cultured in these modi ﬁ ed experimental conditions , i . e . , for 3 h and without FCS , showing no substantial variations in cell area with respect to 6 - h culture with FCS ( Supplementary Figure 6F ) . In order to assess whether the FAs proteins distribution was comparabletothe previouslyused celllines , the localization of talin and phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase ( pFAK ) was studied . Figures 5A , B depict talin and pFAK distribution in GD25 - wt and GD25 - β 1A cells respectively , for the most extreme aFN densities , i . e . , undiluted on ﬂ at substrates and on patterns with resulting 5 % ligand density per unit area . A constant behaviour to be observed is the presence of talin in correspondence to FAs sites both peripherally and centrally , and a more con ﬁ ned presence of pFAK . This latter , instead , localizes predominantly in the outer regions of the cell body . Interestingly , patterned substrates clearly show that clustering of talin in GD25 - wt is also impaired , while a certain activity of pFAK is still present at the peripheral micro - pillars . Even in this case , distribution is not altered in presence of physically constrained 25 × 25 µm ﬂ at or patterned substrates ( Supplementary Figure S7 for GD25 - β 1A ) . Discussion and conclusion Taken together , our results suggest that cells are able to sense FN density on substrates and to adjust their spreading area according to the number of available binding sites , independently whether these are homogeneously distributed or organized in geometrical patterns . Moreover , this behaviour is mainly driven by the β 1 integrin subunit , with other FA Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin . org 07 Lemma et al . 10 . 3389 / fbioe . 2022 . 964259 proteins playing a secondary role . Indeed , understanding single - cell mechanics is a fundamental challenge in cell biology research because of the dynamic behaviour of every living organism , as well as for its countless practical applications in physiology and pathology ( Jansen et al . , 2015 ; Ruprecht et al . , 2017 ; Matellan and Del Río Hernández , 2019 ) . Despite advancements in the ﬁ eld that have allowed to disclose complex mechanisms underlying cell mechanical behaviour in a variety of conditions , it is still dif ﬁ cult to implement experimental setups to evaluate independently the several factors which play a role in cell mechanosensing . The complexity level of cells cannot be unlocked in single experiments , but it is increasingly easier to control parameters external to cells themselves , e . g . , when dealing with ECM - like microenvironments . Improvements in microfabrication techniques have been allowing for more physiological and controlled conditions for cell culture and investigation of their interactions with the ECM . Our work intended to clarify the role of two conditions which are common to all complex systems for studying cell mechanosensing and are key to cell spreading : the effect of the amount of ECM protein which functionalizes the cell microenvironment and of the geometrical distribution of the protein itself in the microenvironment . In a relatively simple setup cells were subjected to spreading on different densities of FN on ﬂ at and micropatterned substrates . Results showed that independently on the substrate texture , cells were able to increase their area to a maximum threshold as a consequence of increase in protein availability . This behaviour suggests that cells may sense the amount of ligands and adjust their spreading to an optimal value for homeostasis , for that speci ﬁ c amount . This view implies an active role of cell mechanosensory machinery in 1 ) recognizing the FN availability and 2 ) provide a feedback to either induce further spreading or remain on a steady state FIGURE 4 Cell area dependency on FN availability is absent in GD25 - wt cells and is restored in GD25 - β 1A . ( A ) β 1 - de ﬁ cient cells GD25 - wt lack any increasing trend of spreading area , either on aFN diluted surfaces or patterns . Immunocytochemical stainings show the absence of β 1 integrins ( cell contours were drawn for eye guidance ) . ( B ) GD25 - β 1A cells show a restored spreading area trend , as well as β 1 clusters on patterned surfaces centrally and peripherally . Scalebar 20 µm . Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin . org 08 Lemma et al . 10 . 3389 / fbioe . 2022 . 964259 condition . According to our evidence , β 1 integrins seem to be responsible for integrating the amount of available FN together with talin : indeed , the localization of both proteins on areas at highest ligand availability con ﬁ rm they are both needed to form the necessary bindings to the FN functionalized surfaces . Further evidence of this statement is the loss of cell area dependence on ﬁ bronectin density when β 1 is impaired , e . g . , in GD25 - wt cells . The colocalization of talin clustering sites with β 1 integrins and the counterpart peripheral localization of pFAK , despite not exhaustively clarifying the role of both proteins in mechanosensing , let us envision a direct involvement of the integrin - talin - actin axis in the quanti ﬁ cation of ligand density on substrates . On the other hand , other FA proteins seem to be less directly involved in the recognition of availability sites of ligands . This let us envision for them an almost exclusive role in signalling and regulation downstream kinases and proteins of the Rho family ( Schaller , 2010 ; Hytönen and Wehrle - Haller , 2016 ) , and recruitment of the biochemical tools for cell spreading and locomotion , e . g . , ultimately actin monomers to bundle in stress ﬁ bres . This hypothesis is in agreement with the model proposed by Stutchbury et al . ( 2017 ) , according to which talin and FAK ( together with paxillin and their phosphorylated version , and other minor FAs proteins like kindlin2 and α - actinin ) belong to two distinct classes of FA proteins with different turnovers and roles in orchestrating cell spreading and migration .

After 2 h incubation in silane solution , coverslips were rinsed twice in distilled water to complete the silanization reaction and dried with nitrogen . A droplet ( ≈ 20 µl ) of protein - repellent photoresist , i . e . , trimethylolpropane ethoxylate triacrylate ( TPETA , mean molecular weight 692Da , CAS number 28961 – 43 – 5 , from Sigma ) was cast on the silanized surface of the coverslip and exposed to a 780 - nm femtosecond pulsed laser ( Photonic Professional GT from Nanoscribe GmbH ) . After polymerization of the passivating structures , excess resist was removed in a bath of isopropanol . After drying , a droplet of FN - adhesive photoresist , i . e . , pentaerythritol triacrylate ( PETA , CAS number 3524 – 68 – 3 , from Sigma ) was cast on the sample , in order for the previously polymerized structures to be completely covered with the material . Writing of the designed structures was then performed and followed by excess resist development in a bath of 1 : 1 mixture of isopropanol : methyl - isobutyl - ketone . Structures were subsequently kept in isopropanol for sterilization and functionalized with FN . The micro - islands were designed as cylinders with diameter 1 µm and height 500 nm , equally spaced by 3 µm center to center . The slicing ad hatching parameters were optimized for a ×63 oil immersion objective and were therefore set to 0 . 3 and 0 . 5 µm , respectively . The hatching was performed by using the “ contour ” option of the Describe software ( from Nanoscribe GmbH ) to improve shape ﬁ delity . After fabrication and SEM inspection the pillars showed a more ellipsoidal shape with 1 . 5 × 0 . 7 × 0 . 7 µm dimensions ( semiaxes a × b × c in Supplementary Figure S1B ) . For both resists , the laser power ranged from 50 to 70 % of the maximal available ( ≈ 55 mW ) and the writing speed ranged from 2000 μ m / s to 15000 μ m / s . Micropatterned substrates for µCP were prepared as described elsewhere ( Lehnert et al . , 2004 ) . Brie ﬂ y , a pattern consisted of two spot sizes ( 1 µm and 3 µm square ) combined with eight distances ( 4 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , 30 and 35 µm centre to centre ) , and was transferred to a coverslip coated with 20 nm gold . 1 . 5 mM solution of octadecylmercaptan ( Sigma Aldrich ) in ethanol was used as linker for binding of ECM protein to the surface . A hydrophilic alkanethiol ( i . e . , tri ( ethylene glycol ) - terminated alkanethiol , 1 . 5 mM in ethanol , Prochima ) was used to block the remaining area and create an anti - adhesive background . The ECM - protein molecules selectively adsorbed onto the hydrophobic areas and formed a functionalized pattern . Functionalization and cell culture Samples kept in isopropanol after 2PL were thoroughly washed with PBS ( Ca 2 + - and Mg 2 + - free ) . For samples with non - reduced amount of active FN , 20 µl of a 10 μ g / ml FN solution in PBS were placed on the area of the coverslip where structures had been fabricated . In the case of reduced active FN , denatured protein ( heat treatment at 95 ° C for 30 min in PBS solution ) was added to active FN to maintain always a ﬁ nal concentration of 10 μ g / ml FN . As an example , for 500 molecules / µm 2 of active FN , 10 µl of denatured FN ( at 10 μ g / μ l ) were added to 10 µl of active FN ( at 10 μ g / ml ) and used to functionalize the structures . In all cases , incubation was carried out for 1 h . All samples were then rinsed twice with PBS and cells were seeded . Mouse B16 melanoma cells , buffalo rat liver cells ( BRL ) , human lung cancer cells ( A549 ) , and mouse embryo ﬁ broblasts ( NIH - 3T3 ) were obtained from American Type Tissue Culture Collection ( ATCC ) . GD25 - wt and GD25 - β 1A cells were obtained from Prof . Bernhard Wehrle - Haller ’ s laboratory ( Dept . of cell physiology and metabolism , University of Geneva , Switzerland ) . For routine culture , cells were grown in Dulbecco ’ s Modi ﬁ ed Eagle Medium ( DMEM ) , both supplemented with 10 % FCS . GD25 - β 1A were cultured in DMEM + 10 % FCS and 10 mg / ml puromycin . Cells were always cultured in humidi ﬁ ed atmosphere and 5 % CO 2 . For detachment from culture ﬂ asks , cellswerewashedtwicewithPBS ( Ca 2 + - andMg 2 + - free ) and removed from tissue culture plates by treatment with 0 . 1 % trypsin / EDTA for 3 – 5 min . Dissociated cells were washed in DMEM with FCS for 3 min , and centrifuged ( 1000 rpm for 5 min ) . The cell pellet was resuspended and seeded [ ≈ 1 × 10 ( Geiger et al . , 2009 ) cells / cm 2 ] onthepatterned substratain2 ml DMEMwithoutFCS ( withthe exception of GD25 - wt and GD25 - β 1A ) and cultured for three ( B16 , BRL , A549 , NIH - 3T3 ) or six ( GD25 - wt and GD25 - β 1A ) hours . Immunohistochemistry Cells were ﬁ xed for 10 min with 4 % PFA in PBS , washed three times with PBS containing 0 . 1 % TritonX - 100 ( PBST ) and incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h . The following primary antibodies were used : polyclonal anti - ﬁ bronectin ( rabbit IgG , number F - 3648 from Sigma ) diluted 1 : 500 in PBS + 1 % BSA , monoclonal anti - pFAK Tyr397 ( rabbit IgG , number 700255 from Invitrogen ) diluted 1 : 300 in PBS + 1 % BSA , monoclonal anti - talin ( mouse IgG , number TA1721 from Biotrend ) diluted 1 : 100 in PBS + 1 % BSA , monoclonal anti - β 1 - integrin ( rat IgG , number 550531 from BD Pharmingen ) diluted 1 : 100 in PBS + 1 % BSA , monoclonal anti - vinculin ( mouse IgG , number ab11194 from abcam ) diluted 1 : 100 in PBS + 1 % BSA , polyclonal anti - kindlin2 ( rabbit IgG , number K3269 from Sigma ) diluted 1 : 250 in PBS + 1 % BSA , monoclonal anti - α - actinin ( mouse IgG , number A7811 from Sigma ) diluted 1 : 300 in PBS + 1 % BSA , monoclonal anti - phosphopaxillin ( rabbit IgG , number ab32115 from abcam ) diluted 1 : 500 in PBS + 1 % BSA . After incubation , samples were washed with PBST for three times and incubated with secondary antibodies for 1 h . The appropriate ﬂ uorescently coupled secondary antibodies ( Cy3 , Cy5 , dilutions 1 : 400 and 1 : 200 , respectively ) were obtained Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin . org 10 Lemma et al . 10 . 3389 / fbioe . 2022 . 964259 from Dianova or Molecular Probes . Actin ﬁ laments were stained with AlexaFluor488 - coupled phalloidin ( diluted 1 : 200 ) , nuclei were stained with DAPI ( diluted 1 : 1000 ) . After a ﬁ nal rinse , samples were mounted in Mowiol containing 1 % N - propyl - gallate and analysed via laser scanning microscopy . Microscopy and cell area measurement Confocal microscopy ( LSM 800 , LSM 510 and Apotome , Zeiss ) was used for image acquisition . Pictures for cell area measurements were taken with ×40 magni ﬁ cation , oil immersion ( N . A . 1 . 2 ) , while FA proteins imaging required ×63 magni ﬁ cation ( oil immersion ) with N . A . 1 . 4 to maximize achievable resolution . Laser intensity and gain were adjusted according to the needed requirements . DAPI and Cy3 ﬂ uorescence were acquired simultaneously , in sequence to Cy5 , and AlexaFluor488 signals . Digital zoom and image size were always adjusted to ensure ful ﬁ lment of the Nyquist criterion , colour depth was set to 8 bits . Pictures were then opened in the open source Fiji - ImageJ software and AlexaFluor488 signal was shown in grey tones . A suitable threshold was then chosen in order to exclude background ( usually pixels of greyscale values below 10 ) , and to ensure that cell shape was not arti ﬁ cially diminished . Cell contours were then traced via the “ wand tool ” and cell surface ( i . e . , the pixel area comprised within the traced contours ) was then automatically measured from the software . In all manuscript ﬁ gures , contrast and brightness were adjusted of the same amount exclusively for editorial purposes . For scanning electron microscopy of patterns ( Supplementary Figure 2A ) , a Zeiss Supra microscope was used and samples without cells on them were gold - sputtered ( ≈ 7 nm ) prior to visualization . Statistical methods All experiments were performed at least in duplicate , statistical signi ﬁ cance was assessed between experiments performed in triplicate . In particular , average values of cell areas were compared , and statistical signi ﬁ cance was proved with Student´s t - test , with the following p - values : * * * p ≤ 0 . 001 , * * 0 . 001 < p ≤ 0 . 01 , * 0 . 01 < p ≤ 0 . 05 . Total number of analyzed cells was n ≥ 50 per each experimental condition . Data availability statement The datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories .
