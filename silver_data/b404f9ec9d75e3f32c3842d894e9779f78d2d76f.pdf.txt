ABSTRACT Since evidence is rising that extracellular matrix ( ECM ) fibers might serve as reservoirs for growth factors and cytokines , we investigated the interaction between fibronectin ( FN ) and interleukin - 7 ( IL - 7 ) , a cytokine of immunological significance and a target of several immunotherapies . By employing a FN fiber stretch assay and Förster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) confocal microscopy , we found that stretching of FN fibers increased IL - 7 binding . We localized the FN binding site on the CD - loop of IL - 7 , since a synthetic CD - loop peptide also bound stronger to stretched than to relaxed FN fibers . Based on a structural model , we propose that the CD - loop can bind to FN , while IL - 7 is bound to its cognate cell surface receptors . Sequence alignment with bacterial adhesins , which also bind the FN N - terminus , suggests that a conserved motif on the CD - loop ( 110 TKSLEEN 116 and the truncated 112 SLEE 115 in human and mouse IL - 7 respectively ) might bind to the second FN type I module ( FnI 2 ) , and that additional epitopes enhance the stretch - upregulated binding . FN fiber stretching might thus serve as a mechano - regulated mechanism to locally concentrate IL - 7 in an ECM - bound state , thereby upregulating the potency of IL - 7 signaling . A feedback model mechanism is proposed that could explain the well known , but poorly understood , function of IL - 7 in ECM homeostasis .

KEYWORDS fibronectin , interleukin - 7 , mechanical strain , mechanobiology of extracellular matrix , cytokine binding . Interleukin - 7 ( IL - 7 ) is a 17 . 4 kDa cytokine belonging to the γ - c interleukin family , which plays a crucial role in the development of B - and T - cells in the thymus 1 , and in the survival , proliferation and differentiation of naive and memory T - cells in secondary lymphoid organs such as the lymph nodes 2 - 6 . IL - 7 is produced by stromal cells , acts as a short - range signal for common lymphoid progenitor cell differentiation 7 and enhances lymphatic endothelial cell activity in vitro and lymphangiogenesis in vivo , as well as lymphatic drainage 8 , and the reconstruction and remodeling of the lymph node 9 . IL - 7 has also been implicated in other cell functions , such as the development of dendritic cells , natural killer cells and lymphoid tissue inducer cells 10 , and it has been shown to inhibit osteoclastogenesis from bone marrow cultures and monocytes 11 , 12 . Because of the immune - boosting properties of IL - 7 , there are currently several clinical trials underway which test the use of recombinant human IL - 7 ( rhIL - 7 ) in immunotherapies against several diseases such as HIV , cancer , lymphocytopenia , chronic viral infections , hepatitis B and C , and congenital immunodeficiency 10 , as well as to boost the immune system of older subjects who have had chemotherapy with human IL - 7 vaccines 13 . Conversely , blocking the IL - 7 signaling pathway by means of antibodies against IL - 7 , or its receptor IL7RA , is currently being investigated to treat diseases with an over - reactive immune response , such as multiple sclerosis , type 1 diabetes , rheumatoid arthritis , Sjögren ' s syndrome , Page 2 of 37 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Nano Letters 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 3 inflammatory bowel disease and systemic lupus erythematous 10 , 14 . Increasing the efficacy of such treatments requires knowledge of the factors that control local IL - 7 availability ; this is especially important because IL - 7 concentration in viv o is very small ( 10 – 40 pg / ml in plasma , and 15 – 35 pg / mL in lymph ) 8 , 9 and many cells , such as T - cells 15 - 17 , B - cells , thymocytes 18 , and stromal cells like lymphatic endothelial cells 8 depend on and compete for it . This tight competition suggests the existence of mechanisms that might enhance the local concentration and regulate the bioavailability of IL - 7 19 . Mechanically regulated sequestration and release of IL - 7 could be one possibility , but this idea has never been tested . In clinical studies where rhIL - 7 was administered , it was shown that although the measured half - life of IL - 7 is at the range of hours ( 6 – 23 hours ) , the biological effects persisted for days , and in some studies , even for several weeks 10 . Such long - lasting effects could result from long - term cell memory achieved though the secretion of micro - RNA 20 ; additionally , it was proposed that a combination of IL - 7 binding to the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) ( followed by slow release ) , and downstream changes in cell proliferation and survival that persist beyond the initial IL - 7 stimulation might also contribute 10 . Indeed , a few studies showed interactions between IL - 7 and ECM components , such as glycosaminoglycans , collagen type IV , laminin and FN 21 - 23 . Recombinant human IL - 7 was reported to bind to ECM or surface - bound FN with IC 50 values of 10 – 100 nM 21 , and ECM - bound IL - 7 was found to be significantly more potent than soluble IL - 7 with respect to its pro - adhesive activity on T - cells 21 . It is therefore crucial for both basic immunological research , as well as for clinical studies , to understand how the local IL - 7 availability is modulated not only by cellular production and consumption , but also by interactions with the ECM . In contrast to other cytokines such as IL - 2 , IL - 7 is a prototypical homeostatic cytokine that provides continuous signals to resting naïve and memory T cells , but it Page 3 of 37 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Nano Letters 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 4 does not activate T - cells 10 . However , how it can provide for continuous signaling if available only at such low concentrations remains elusive . FN is one of the major fibrillar components of ECM and contains many binding sites for other ECM proteins and carbohydrates ( including self - association sites ) , cell - ECM binding proteins such as integrins 24 , 25 , and other cytokines and growth factors such as tumor necrosis factor α ( TNF - α ) 26 , members of the platelet - derived growth factor ( PDGF ) and fibroblast growth factor ( FGF ) families , several vascular endothelial growth factors ( VEGFs ) , transforming growth factor β 1 ( TGF - β 1 ) 27 and the latent complex of TGF - β 1 28 - 32 . Most importantly for this work , IL - 7 has been shown to bind 3 - 4 fold stronger to substrate - adsorbed FN than to bovine serum albumin or hemoglobin 21 , and interacts with the FN N - terminus 21 . Its therein reported binding kinetics and its binding to albumin suggest that it interacts with proteins also via hydrophobic interactions . Several of the binding sites on FN have been shown already to be either cryptic or mechanosensitive , i . e . , opening up or destroyed upon mechanical stretching / unfolding of FN , respectively 33 - 40 . Unfolding and refolding of FN can be mediated by the application of cell traction forces or by proteolytic cleavage due to responses to inflammation , respectively . Alterations in the tensional state of ECM fibers are expected to result in extensive ECM and tissue remodeling , including at sites that are immunologically active , such as the lymph nodes 41 - 47 . It is therefore important to understand how such changes in the tensional state of ECM fibers may affect binding , and consequently , the local availability and signaling activity of cytokines . Although binding studies of signaling molecules to fibrillar ECM have been performed , these have mostly focused on chemokines and growth factors relevant to stromal cells 29 , 48 - 50 , while Page 4 of 37 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Nano Letters 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 5 cytokines that have a more specific homeostatic function on immunological cells , such as IL - 7 , have found far less attention in the ECM community . Previous IL - 7 binding studies to FN have been performed with FN in solution or adsorbed to a rigid substrate 21 - 23 . Since it is known that fibrillar FN has different structural and functional properties than FN in solution or substrate - adsorbed FN 38 , 47 , 51 - 53 , we conducted our IL - 7 binding studies on fibrillar FN , which constitutes a more physiologically relevant platform than surface - adsorbed or soluble FN . Indeed , previous studies have shown that FN molecules in FN fibers stretched from 0 to 400 % display a range of conformations also observed in FN fibrils in native ECM produced by fibroblasts in cell culture 51 . Using this platform , we investigated whether the binding affinity of IL - 7 to FN fibers is altered when these get stretched . Our goal was to explore whether the tensional state of ECM fibrils can regulate the bioavailability of this immunologically relevant cytokine . Stretching of FN fibers increases IL - 7 binding . To investigate IL - 7 binding to fibrillar FN and how it is affected by the tensional state of FN fibers , we employed a stretch binding assay developed earlier in our lab 37 , 47 , 51 , where single FN fibers were manually pulled out of a solution of FN isolated from human plasma and deposited on a stretchable silicone sheet , which was mounted on a uniaxial stretching device to control the strain of the deposited fibers ( Fig . 1A ) . To avoid intermolecular FRET , the pulled FN fibers contained only 5 % of FRET - labeled FN ( FN - FRET ) to assess the level of FN stretching at the molecular level . To exploit FN - FRET as a nanoscale strain sensor , where the FRET ratio decreases upon fiber stretching 47 , 51 , 53 , the molecule was labeled with multiple donors and acceptors to cover a large range of conformational changes . Lysine residues on FN were randomly labeled with donor fluorophores ( Alexa 488 , A488 ) , and the cysteines on FN modules FnI 7 and FNI 15 were labeled with acceptor Page 5 of 37 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Nano Letters 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 6 fluorophores ( Alexa 546 , A546 ) . For every FN - FRET batch , we confirmed in a control experiment that changes in FN - FRET ratios occur upon chemical denaturation of FN ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . Since forces in the µ N - range are required to pull the fibers out of the droplet , and the fibers have to be kept under tension as they are deposited on the silicone substrate , they are typically pre - strained to approximately 140 % 38 ( Fig . 1A ) . This has been previously estimated by depositing manually pulled FN fibers across microfabricated trenches on a stretchable PDMS ( Polydimethylsiloxane ) sheet , which was pre - strained . The PDMS sheet was then slowly relaxed until the FN fibers began to sag . The PDMS strain at which 50 % of the fibers were no longer straight and mechanical tension was absent , approximately correlated with a normalized FN fiber strain of 0 % 38 . It has also been previously shown that no slipping among FN molecules occurs upon force application , since when the applied tensile force was released , the FN fibers contracted and returned to their initial extension and recovered their mechanical properties 38 . Also the initial FRET ratios were recovered 47 . To observe in one image how FN fiber straining versus relaxation affects IL - 7 binding , we first deposited FN fibers in a grid configuration ( native silicone membrane = 140 % FN fiber strain ) , and then stretched the membrane along the principle axis ( stretched silicone membrane = 380 % FN fiber strain ) , which leads to a relaxation of the FN fibers deposited in the transverse direction ( 20 % FN fiber strain ) ( Fig . 1A ) . Following incubation of the fiber grids with recombinant human IL - 7 randomly labeled on lysines with Alexa 647 ( A647 - IL - 7 ) , the samples were visualized by confocal microscopy . IL - 7 binding was assessed by pixel - by - pixel quantification of the A647 - IL - 7 fluorescence intensity over the directly excited acceptor A546 - FN intensity to normalize for the FN content ( Fig . 1 and Supplementary Figs . 4 and 6 ) . Corrections to ensure that the donor and acceptor intensities were solely due to FN - FRET were performed as previously described 54 - Page 6 of 37 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Nano Letters 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 7 56 . A detailed description of the method , including details on image acquisition parameters , microscopy controls , and data processing for adequate image registration can be found in the Supporting Material ( Materials and Methods , Supplementary Fig . S2 and S3 ) . The resulting images ( Fig . 1B ) clearly show that IL - 7 binding to highly stretched FN fibers ( 380 % ) is significantly higher than that to the more relaxed fibers strained to 140 % and 20 % . The signal enhancement was even more pronounced upon normalization of the IL - 7 signal ( A647 - IL7 / A546 - FN ratios ) , which was performed to correct for the stretching - induced reduction in the distances between specific binding sites on FN molecules ( Fig . 1B – C ) . Scatter plots of the constituent pixels for the fibers are given in Fig . 1C , with each strain showing a distinct pixel population , corresponding to the range of conformations that coexist in single FN fibers . Data from several fiber intersections are shown in Supplementary Fig . S5 , confirming the consistency of the results . To increase statistical significance , we then tested FN - FRET fibers only deposited in one direction and strained to 20 % , 140 % , and 380 % , respectively . In contrast to the grid configuration , these FN fibers are free from shear due to physical contact at the cross - section with perpendicular fibers . We analyzed 20 fibers per strain , and confirmed that human IL - 7 binding increased with increasing FN stretching ( representative results are shown in Supplementary Fig . S6 ) . A scatter plot of FN - FRET versus normalized IL - 7 binding for each pixel is shown in Fig . 2A , along with mean values for each fiber ( Fig . 2A ; circles for 20 % strain , squares for 140 % strain , and triangles for 380 % strain ) . We found statistically significant increases in IL - 7 binding to fibers , from 20 % , 140 % to 380 % strain ( p < 0 . 001 ; Fig . 2A ) , i . e . , in a range of strains typically seen in the ECM of fibroblasts in cell culture 51 , 57 . Moving mean values of IL - 7 binding ( red curve ) and their corresponding estimated standard deviation ( orange Page 7 of 37 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Nano Letters 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 8 curves ) were thereby calculated by pooling pixels in bins of 6 x 10 - 3 FRET units . The values considered for the calculation of the curves were limited to the range from the 25 th percentile of the lowest FRET value group ( relaxed membranes ) to the 75 th percentile of the highest FRET value group ( stretched membranes ) , where the data density remained sufficiently high . Box plots of fiber mean values for FRET and normalized IL - 7 binding for all 20 fibers per strain are shown along with the single pixel values for the whole data set , and normalized histograms showing the underlying data distributions generated by pooling all the pixels per strain are shown next to the corresponding axes of the scatter plots . Statistical significance between groups was assessed by the non - parametric two - sided Wilcoxon rank sum test , which does not imply data distribution normality ( since not all the groups showed a distinct normal distribution ) . Similar results were obtained in a replicate experiment and a control experiment with A488 - labeled IL - 7 and unlabeled FN ( Supplementary Figs . 7 - 8 ) , verifying that the data reflect the intrinsic IL - 7 / FN interactions and are not driven by the fluorophores . In similar experiments performed with A647 labeled recombinant murine IL - 7 ( A647 - rmIL7 ) , we confirmed that murine IL - 7 shows a rather similar binding behavior to FN fibers , although the FN fibers need to be more stretched to upregulate murine IL - 7 binding ( Supplementary Fig . S9 - 10 ) . The CD loop of IL - 7 binds preferentially to more stretched FN fibers and is likely to mediate IL - 7 / FN binding . Since the IL - 7 epitope ( or epitopes ) recognizing FN has not yet been determined , we searched for clues on its structure , as shown in Fig . 3A . IL - 7 consists of four alpha - helices ( A – D ) stacked in an up - up - down - down manner , bound by three major connecting loops ( AB , BC , and CD ) and a mini - alpha - helix located along the loop A – B 58 . Since the CD loop has not been resolved in the crystallographic data 58 , we used the modeling tool Modeller 59 within Page 8 of 37 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Nano Letters 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 9 the molecular imaging package UCSF Chimera 60 , to add the unstructured CD loop to the structure of IL - 7 ( Fig . 3A ) . Interestingly , an earlier study has shown that deletion of the CD loop ( identified there as a 19 amino acid sequence ) does not interfere with binding of IL - 7 to its cell surface receptors and the subsequent signaling activity 61 . This raises the interesting possibility that while IL - 7 is engaged in interactions with its receptors , the CD - loop may be free to participate in interactions with other molecules such as FN . Indeed , adding our model with the inserted CD - loop , to a model of IL - 7 bound to its cognate cell surface receptors 6 , also using Modeller , supports this hypothesis . The CD loop does not seem to interfere with binding of IL - 7 to its cell receptors , and appears to be relatively free for interaction with additional molecules , such as FN ( Fig . 3B ) . A 3D structural model of human IL7RA / IL2RG / IL7 with the inserted CD loop and a corresponding video are provided in the Supportive Information . In our search to determine whether the CD loop could potentially mediate specific interactions between IL - 7 and FN , we first evaluated the level of sequence conservation among different species . Sequence alignment between human and murine IL - 7 ( Fig . 3C ) , including a comparison of the hydrophobicity of the two protein homologs showed no marked differences ( Fig . 3C ) , suggesting overall structural similarity , except in the CD loop region , where the CD loop of murine IL - 7 is much shorter than that of human IL - 7 ( 18 vs . 37 amino acids respectively , leading to a length of ~ 6 . 5 nm vs . ~ 14 nm , respectively ) , with the common region of the CD - loop remaining highly conserved between human and murine IL - 7 ( Fig . 3C ) . Among the 18 amino acids missing in the CD loop of murine IL - 7 , there are several positively charged residues , a row of 5 hydrophobic residues , and the N - glycosylation site at position 141 ( Fig . 3D ) . To evaluate whether the CD - loop is involved in the stretch - enhanced binding of IL - 7 to FN fibers , we directly tested the binding of a synthetic CD loop peptide to differently stretched FN Page 9 of 37 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Nano Letters 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 10 fibers . A 36 amino acid - long peptide with the sequence of the human CD - loop ( 91 NCTGQVKGRKPAALGEAQPTKSLEENKSLKEQKKLND 127 ) was synthesized , labeled on the first cysteine ( underlined ) with Alexa Fluor - 647 , and used for binding experiments with manually pulled FN fibers at three different strains , 20 % , 140 % , and 380 % , with 20 fibers per strain ( Supporting Material : Materials and Methods ) . Similar to full - length IL - 7 , we found that the human CD loop peptide indeed bound to FN fibers in a stretch - enhanced manner ( Fig . 2B ) . Although the differences between binding to fibers experiencing 20 % and 140 % strain were not as marked as those observed with full - length IL - 7 , they were statistically significant , and therefore consistent with the hypothesis that the CD - loop mediates IL - 7 binding to FN . Sequence alignment between the CD - loop peptide and bacterial adhesins that also target the FN N - terminus . Since various bacterial adhesins also target the N - terminal FnI modules 36 , 37 , 62 - 65 , as does IL - 7 21 , we aligned the sequence of the CD - loop with those of the bacterial peptides ( Fig . 4 ) . The bacterial adhesins bind to the N - terminus of FN through the formation of antiparallel β - strands with each of the FnI 2 - 5 modules 36 , 37 , 62 - 65 ( Fig . 4 ) . Since the IL - 7 binding site on FN has not been determined , we asked whether sequence homology exists between the CD loop peptide and the bacterial adhesins 36 . The sequence alignment revealed significant homology between the double negatively - charged 110 TKSLEEN 116 motif on the CD - loop peptide of human IL - 7 or the truncated 112 SLEE 115 motif of mouse IL - 7 , and the bacterial β - strands that bind to FnI 2 ( Fig . 4 ) . Less , but still remarkable homology is seen between the mostly hydrophobic 101 PAALGEA 107 motif on the human CD - loop peptide , and the bacterial β - strand that bind to the FnI 3 module ( Figs . 3 and 4 ) . These two CD - loop peptide fragments are connected by a two amino acid - long linker ( 108 QP 109 ) . The peptide fragment containing amino acids 101 – 116 is flanked on both termini by highly charges residues ( 96 VKGRK 100 and Page 10 of 37 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Nano Letters 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 11 117 KSLKEQKKLND 127 ) , both of which have some homology with the loop regions of the respective bacterial adhesins that connect the β - strand forming sequences , but do not themselves bind to FnI modules . The 101 PAALGEA 107 , as well as the highly charged 96 VKGRK 100 motifs , however , are missing in the CD - loop of mouse IL - 7 , yet binding of mouse IL - 7 is also upregulated to stretched FN fibers ( Supplementary Fig . S9 and S10 ) . Taken together with the fact that the human CD - loop peptide itself can recapitulate the FN binding behavior of full - length human and mouse IL - 7 , we propose that the CD - loop fragment 110 TKSLEEN 116 might be the primary epitope of IL - 7 that binds to FN , and particularly , to module FnI 2 . FN fiber strain increases IL - 7 and CD - loop binding ( Fig . 2 ) , whereas it decreases the binding of certain bacterial peptides , as stretching of FN fibers destroys the structural match between those bacterial peptides and the stretched FnI 2 - 5 segment 36 , 37 . Since FnI modules contain two disulfide bonds each , their secondary structure remains mostly intact upon stretching ; however , the distance between these modules increases , mostly by stretching the linker regions between two FnI modules 36 , 37 . In contrast , the short CD - loop peptide 110 TKSLEEN 116 can only bind to one FnI module , possibly to FnI 2 , as suggested by its homology to the bacterial peptides . Enhanced CD - loop peptide binding to stretched FN suggests that additional interactions stabilize IL - 7 on stretched FN , for example interactions with hydrophobic residues or otherwise cryptic sites , that become exposed upon FN fiber stretching 33 , 66 . Additional interactions might form with the highly charged CD - loop peptide 117 KSLKEQKKLND 127 , which is highly preserved between the human and murine IL - 7 CD loop ( Fig . 3 ) , while interactions with other parts of the protein cannot be excluded . We envision that the novel structural insights provided by our findings will motivate further studies to define the interacting epitopes between IL - 7 and FN .

IL - 7 , which is secreted by stromal cells at very low concentrations 8 , 9 , 67 , 68 , does not lead to T - cell activation but is known to provide continuous signals to resting naïve and memory T cells 10 . How IL - 7 can mediate a homeostasis keeper function at such low cytokine concentrations ( 10 – 40 pg / ml in plasma and 15 – 35 pg / mL in lymph 8 , 9 ) remains unknown . Bringing our findings that IL - 7 is modulated by ECM tension together with existing literature , we propose the following mechanism of how the tensional state of FN fibers might alter IL - 7 signaling to maintain ECM homeostasis ( Fig . 5 ) . Enhanced binding of IL - 7 to stretched fibers ( Figs . 1 – 2 ) , might increase its local fiber - bound availability and potency , as suggested by studies showing ECM - bound IL - 7 to be more potent than soluble IL - 7 in promoting T - cell adhesion 21 . Consequently , IL - 7 stimulation may cause changes in paracrine signaling , cell traction forces and / or ECM / cell interface , which vice versa might cause the FN fibers to relax : for example , it is known that IL - 7 downregulates the expression of collagen I and FN in human subconjunctival fibroblasts 69 , increases the expression and activation of α 4 β 7 integrins in naive T - cells 70 , increases the expression of integrin α 5 β 1 in lymphatic endothelial cells ( LECs ) 8 , activates α 4 β 1 integrins in murine thymocytes 71 , downregulates the expression of α - SMA 69 , 72 , and increases the production of matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) in human articular chondrocytes 73 . Thus , the consequent alterations in stromal cell contractility or matrix cleavage by MMPs might lead to a partial relaxation of FN fibers , which in turn could reduce the amount of FN - bound IL - 7 and its bioavailability , affect the stromal cells , and initiate a negative feed - back loop . A similar concept can be found in bone homeostasis , which is maintained not by tightly keeping the status quo , but by constant remodeling through bone deposition and degradation , which allows bone to adapt its strength to external stimuli . Similarly , we hypothesize that IL - 7 Page 12 of 37 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Nano Letters 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 13 helps stromal cells to keep a responsive homeostatic environment by gradual tensing and relaxing FN fibers and thereby tuning the bioavailability of IL - 7 . Additionally , IL - 7 has been shown to bind to collagen IV 21 , and to modify the expression of collagen I 69 . Since it has been shown that collagen deposition increases during tumor formation , including collagen types I , II , III , V , and IX 74 - 77 , changes in the IL - 7 / ECM homeostatic balance might contribute to the altered tissue physiology observed in cancer . To demonstrate such concepts , further studies are required to elucidate the role of stretch - enhanced IL - 7 binding to FN on diverse cellular functions , ECM remodeling , and their intertwined and mechano - regulated effects . We have demonstrated for the first time that the binding of a cytokine to FN fibers is regulated by fiber tension . We could show that FN fiber stretching upregulates IL - 7 binding via its CD - loop ( Figs . 1 - 2 ) , and have suggested a structural mechanism that mediates its binding to FN ( Figs . 3 - 4 ) . Furthermore , we propose for the first time , a mechano - regulated feedback mechanism by which IL - 7 might act as prototypical homeostatic cytokine , mediating cytokine / ECM / cell interactions via stretch enhanced IL - 7 binding ( Fig . 5 ) . We believe that our study will motivate further investigations of nanoscale mechano - regulated mechanisms by which IL - 7 and other cytokines might be stored and / or released as a result of modulating the tensional states of ECM fibers . Here we shed light into the mechano - regulation of IL - 7 / FN interactions and their potential effect on IL - 7 bioavailability and functionality . Our proposed mechanism could be relevant for further developments on IL - 7 based immunotherapies .

Human IL - 7 binds more strongly to stretched than to relaxed FN . ( A ) FN fibers were manually pulled out of a droplet of FN in solution containing 5 % FN - FRET , and deposited in a grid configuration on a stretchable silicone sheet , with 10 fibers deposited parallel to the stretch axis and 10 fibers perpendicular to it . The deposited FN fibers were deposited pre - strained to 140 % due to the process of manually pulling them out of solution . The silicone membranes were either left as mounted with FN fibers pre - strained to ~ 140 % ( native membrane ) , stretched to obtain FN strains of ~ 380 % axially and ~ 90 % perpendicularly , or relaxed to obtain FN strains of ~ 20 % axially and ~ 219 % perpendicularly ( only the native and stretched membranes are depicted here ) . ( B - C ) Binding assays with FRET - labeled FN , and A647 - labeled IL - 7 were performed on the FN fiber grids . Representative confocal images of grid intersections between one parallel and one perpendicular fiber are shown for native membranes ( B ) and stretched membranes ( C ) , showing A647 - IL - 7 ( excitation at 647 nm ) and A546 - FN ( directly excited acceptors to determine local FN content ) intensities . The corresponding results for normalized IL - 7 intensity ( A647 - IL - 7 / A546 - FN ) show equal levels of binding among FN fibers on grids not subjected to further stretching ( 140 % FN - fiber strain ) . Conversely , grids on stretched membranes with final FN - FRET fiber strains of 90 % and 380 % show enhanced Il - 7 binding to stretched FN - FRET fibers ( 380 % FN - fiber strain ) vs . FN - FRET fibers with reduced strain due to perpendicular compression of the membranes ( 90 % FN - fiber strain ) . Decreased FN - FRET ratios correspond to increased donor and acceptor distances due to the stretching of the fibers . IL - 7 binding versus FN - FRET data are shown in pixel - by - pixel scatter plots , whereby one population of binding ratios is seen on the unstretched silicone membranes ; fibers on stretched grids show two distinct populations for stretched FN fibers ( 380 % strain ) versus more relaxed FN fibers ( 90 % strain ) , respectively .

Human IL - 7 and the synthesized CD - loop peptide from human IL - 7 show increased binding to stretched FN - FRET fibers . Binding assays with human A647 - IL - 7 ( A ) and a synthesized CD - loop peptide ( B ) were performed in a set of 20 independent FN - FRET fibers deposited on silicone membranes , which were either stretched , left in their native state , or relaxed , resulting in fiber strains of ~ 380 % , ~ 140 % and ~ 20 % , respectively . Mean values for each fiber ( triangles for ~ 380 % strain , squares for ~ 140 % strain and circles for ~ 20 % strain ) are shown along with pixel - by - pixel scatter plots of FRET ratios vs . normalized IL - 7 intensities from all the pixels from all samples . From these pooled pixel - by - pixel data , moving mean curves were generated along the x - axis ( FRET ) with a bin of 6 x 10 - 3 FRET units ( red curves ) , and their standard deviations were estimated ( orange curves ) . To analyze the binding behavior , we limited these curves to a section between the upper and lower percentiles ( 25 th and 75 th of mean FRET values of single fibers ( FRET box plots ) ) . Box plots of the mean values for single fibers , as well as normalized histograms of all pixels are shown for both FN - FRET and normalized IL - 7 binding . We found statistically significant differences between human A647 - IL - 7 binding to fibers at 20 % , 140 % , and 380 % strain ( p < 0 . 001 ) . A647 - CD loop peptide binding to fibers at 20 % , 140 % , and 380 % strain also showed statistically significant differences , although the difference in binding between 20 % and 140 % was less marked than that observed for human A647 - IL7 binding ( p < 0 . 005 ) . These results show increased binding of human IL - 7 and the CD - loop peptide to FN fibers as they become stretched to strains of 20 % , 140 % and 380 % , respectively .

The IL - 7 structure is shown in two different orientations to highlight the loop running parallel to the helical bundles of IL - 7 . ( B ) Model of the receptor - bound ( IL7RA and IL2RG receptors ) IL - 7 based on a published model 6 , 58 , with the IL - 7 CD loop modeled into the structure . In this orientation , the loop does not appear to be involved in the interactions between IL - 7 and its receptors , and is potentially available to interact with FN . ( C ) Sequence alignment between human ( PDB number : P13232 ) and murine ( PDB number : P10168 ) IL - 7 shows the CD loop to be the most distinctive difference between the two homologs , with a similar hydrophobicity profile for the rest of the sequences . ( D ) Sequence alignment between the CD loop of human and murine IL - 7 ( as in Goodwin et al . 61 ) highlighting the conserved as well as missing amino acid sequences between the two homologs . The sequence alignment and analysis was performed with the Matlab , Geneious , and Unipro UGENE software packages .

The mostly hydrophobic 101 PAALGEA 107 motif ( missing in the murine CD - loop ) shows also some homology with the bacterial β - strand that binds to the FnI 3 module . Other motifs with highly charged residues ( 96 VKGRK 100 and 117 KSLKEQKKLND 127 ) show some homology with the loop regions of bacterial adhesins that connect β - strand forming sequences . These sequence homologies , together with the fact that the human CD - loop peptide itself can recapitulate the FN binding behavior of full length human and mouse IL - 7 , suggest that the 110 TKSLEEN 116 motif might be the primary epitope of IL - 7 that binds to FN .

Proposed model for homeostatic regulation of ECM deposition / degradation though mechanically regulated binding of IL - 7 to FN . Based on our findings and the existing literature 8 , 21 , 69 - 73 , we propose a model whereby ECM homeostasis is balanced through a mechano - sensitive negative - feedback loop controlling the binding of IL - 7 to FN in the ECM , and its effects on cellular functions , including tensional state and paracrine signaling . When FN becomes increasingly stretched by stromal cells , IL - 7 binding is enhanced ( as suggested by our results and highlighted in red ) . ECM binding increases the local availability and bio - activity of IL - 7 21 , and existing literature suggests that this might increase MMP production 73 , reduce FN and collagen production 69 , increase activation of integrins 8 , 70 , 71 , and down - regulate α - SMA Page 22 of 37 ACS Paragon Plus Environment Nano Letters 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940414243444546474849505152535455565758 59 60 23 expression 69 , which in turn regulates fibroblast contractility 72 . Consequently , a decrease in ECM deposition coupled with ECM cleavage and degradation might occur , thereby reducing ECM tension and relaxing the constituent FN fibers , and thus decreasing IL - 7 binding ( suggested by our results and highlighted in red ) , effectively counteracting the initial effect . Inversely , a relaxed ECM with lower binding and bio - activity of IL - 7 might decrease IL - 7 , leading to reduced MMP secretion , integrin activation and cell binding , and increased FN , collagen , and α - SMA production , thereby reducing ECM cleavage and degradation , and increasing ECM deposition to reconstitute a matrix in a higher tensional state , which would in turn increase IL - 7 binding to return to a more homeostatic state . Since it has been shown that IL - 7 binds to collagen IV 21 , and modifies the expression of collagen I 69 , and several collagens , including types I , II , III , V , and IX , show increased deposition during tumor formation 74 - 77 , changes in the IL - 7 / ECM homeostatic balance might contribute to the altered tissue physiology observed in cancer .
