The interactions between different topologies of 3D DNA nanostructures and the cell membranes are crucial for designing efficient tools for interfacing DNA devices with biological systems . The practical applications of these DNA nanocages are still limited in cellular and biological systems owing to the limited understanding of interactions of different surface topologies of DNA nanodevices with cell membranes . The correlation between the geometry of DNA nanostructures and their internalization efficiency remains elusive . We investigated the influence of the shape and size of 3D DNA nanostructure on their cellular internalization efficiency . We found that of different geometries designed , one particular geometry , i . e . , the tetrahedral shape , is more favoured over other geometries for their cellular uptake in 2D and 3D cell models . This is also replicable for cellular processes like 3D cell invasion assays in 3D spheroid models and passing the epithelial barriers in in - vivo zebrafish model systems . Our work establishes ground rules for the rational designing of DNA nanodevices for their upcoming biological and biomedical applications . 1 . Introduction DNA nanotechnology utilizes DNA as a structural material to construct DNA - based nanostructures with varying designs ( shapes & sizes ) by harnessing fundamental properties of DNA like orthogonality in base pairing and the ability to self - assemble into higher - order structures 1 – 3 . Structural DNA Nanotechnology has witnessed the ground - breaking developments in recent years in terms of realizing the nano - objects of practically any shape . Recent developments in software for structure prediction can not only guide scientists to develop DNA - based objects of different shapes and sizes but also in quantitative yields and minimum off - targets . DNA nanostructures ( DNs ) have served as promising candidates for 2 various biological and biomedical applications like drug delivery , biosensing , and other therapeutic applications owing to their inherent biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity 4 – 6 . Structural DNA Nanotechnology utilizes small strands of DNA to create various 1D , 2D , and 3D nanodevices . DNA nanostructures are gaining increasing attention in scientific research owing to their ability to be coupled to external biological targeting entities like peptides , small molecules , antibodies , etc . , and their ability to encapsulate various nanoscale cargo within their internal void 7 – 9 . Despite such attractions , the actual applications of these devices have been limited in cellular and biological systems due to a lack of detailed investigations of such nanostructures within cellular and in vivo systems . Cellular delivery of DNA nanostructures is gaining interest because once administered , these nanostructures must be internalized by cells in order to carry out their desired function . The study by Tuberfield and colleagues demonstrating the internalization of DNA tetrahedron in live HEK cells opened new avenues for utilizing DNA nanostructures for bioimaging and delivery of therapeutic agents into live cells 10 . The influence of geometry and size in the internalization of DNA nanostructures has been partially explored 11 . DNA origami nanostructures ( DONs ) with various shapes and sizes have been employed to deliver small molecules such as doxorubicin 12 , 13 , different proteins like nucleolin 14 , antibody 15 – 17 , and therapeutic nucleic acids like aptamer 18 , siRNA 19 , CpG oligonucleotides 20 into cells . However , significantly less research has been undertaken to reveal the influence of shape , size , and cell type in the cellular uptake process . The correlation between the ligand ' s topology and their internalization efficiency remains unexplored . Most of the research undertaken to investigate the design ( shape & size ) specific effect of DNA nanostructures has used origami - based structures that have very high molecular weight compared to 3D DNA polyheras 21 , 22 . We have studied herewith the interaction of 3D DNA nanocages of different geometries and sizes with the plasma membranes of cells and their uptake pathways in cells , tissues , and animals . We have explored different geometries of DNA polyhedras like DNA Tetrahedron ( TD ) , Icosahedron ( ID ) , Cube , and Buckyball ( BB ) and compared their cellular internalization . We have also studied the correlation between geometry and cell type specific internalization in multiple cell lines derived from various body tissues . To further understand the mechanism of cellular uptake of these DNA nanostructures , we have performed inhibitor studies to identify their endocytic route . Finally , we have demonstrated the internalization of DNA nanostructures using 3D spheroid model and in the zebrafish embryos . We observe that of all the geometries explored , cell uptake is maximal for the case of tetrahedral nanocages . We also dissected the mechanism of endocytosis of these cages and found that uptake of DNA cages occurs via clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Once getting uptaken into the cells , these cages trigger processes like 3D invasion in spheroid models . This is also replicable in in - vivo model systems , where we find that tetrahedral DNA nanocages can efficiently cross the mucus barrier for their uptake into the peridermal or outermost epithelial cells in zebrafish embryos . This is for the first time , we show the demonstration of entry of DNA nanocages of different geometries and their effect of interactions with membrane , their specific endocytic uptake into the cells and their effect on cellular physiology like invasion in 3D and lastly crossing the epithelial barriers for successful uptake in model animals . Our 3 studies will establish ground rules for future investigations involving DNA nanocages for biological and biomedical applications specifically involving their surface topologies in the areas of bioimaging , drug delivery , immune activation , differentiations , etc . 2 . Results and discussions 2 . 1 . Design , synthesis , characterization , and stability of DNA nanostructures DNA nanostructures with different geometries were synthesized by utilizing the self - assembly property of the DNA molecule . Using previously published protocols , a panel of four structures comprising of different 3D polyhedral geometries like tetrahedron ( TD ) 23 , Icosahedron ( ID ) 24 , Cube 25 , and buckyball ( BB ) 26 were designed and constructed using thermal annealing protocol in reaction buffer containing 2mM MgCl 2 in nuclease free water . ( Figure 1a ) . DNA TD was assembled using a single - step assembly approach from the equimolar ratio of four single - stranded oligonucleotides mixed in reaction buffer and annealed in the thermocycler . The reaction mixture was heated at 95 o C and then gradually cooled to 4 o C 27 . DNA ID utilized a modular assembly approach where different structures were synthesized separately and assembled to form a complete structure 24 . Cube and BB were assembled using three - point star motif tiles as a building block 25 , 26 . All the structures were labelled with cyanine - 3 ( Cy3 ) dye at their 5 ' end using one of the Cy3 modified ssDNA incorporated during the assembly process . DNA nanostructures were purified by gel electrophoresis and size - exclusion chromatography . 4 Figure 1 . Design , Preparation , and confirmation of DNA nanostructures .

( c ) DLS - based characterization showing the hydrodynamic diameter of structures formed shown in figure 1b indicating the correct sizes of the objects viz . , TD ~ 14 . 7nm , ID ~ 32 . 7 , Cube ~ 24 . 4 , and BB ~ 53 . 8nm . ( d ) Representative AFM images of ( i ) TD , ( ii ) ID , and ( iii ) BB showing the topology of the objects formed in figure 1b . For quantifying the sizes , 5 - 10 particles were analysed using Atomic J software , and the size of TD was ~ 8nm , ID ~ 28nm , and BB ~ 48nm . Scale Bar : 200nm . Electrophoretic mobility shift assay confirmed the formation of the structures with the desired stoichiometry of the component oligos due to its retarding movement in the gel ( Figure 1b ) . AFM and DLS were explored to test if the bands with a lower mobility in gels correspond to the objects of desired size and dimensions . The hydrodynamic size and distribution of nanostructures were detected by dynamic light scattering ( DLS ) . DLS studies showed the hydrodynamic diameter of TDs is 14 . 7± 3 . 8nm , 32 . 7 ± 3 . 2nm for IDs , 24 . 4 ± 2 . 4nm for Cubes , and 53 . 8 ± 8 . 6nm for BBs . These values fit perfectly well with the previously reported data of these structures ( Figure 1c ) . The morphological characterization of the nanostructures was done using atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) , which showed the characteristic shapes and sizes of the nanocages like TD , ID , and BB ( Figure 1d ) . The stability of DNs is a very crucial parameter for utilizing these nanostructures in cellular and biological applications . DNA - based nanostructures are highly susceptible to nuclease degradation outside and inside the cells and can give deceptive fluorescence signals . To test the stability of DNs to the cellular environment , we incubated all DNs with 10 % FBS , the component carrying nucleases . We found that all the DNs were stable for up to 1 hour . ( Figure S1 in supplementary information ) . 2 . 2 . Concentration - dependent uptake of DNA nanostructures in mammalian cells Cellular uptake of DNA constructs relies on transfection agents aid that helps transport DNA across the negatively charged plasma membrane . However , DNA - based nanostructures are known to traverse the membrane of mammalian cells without any aid of transfection agents . Intuitively , we have studied the cellular uptake of well - defined 3D DNA nanostructures ( DNs ) with different topologies in the MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cell line . A concentration - dependent study ( 5 nM to 500 nM ) was performed to identify the optimum concentration for further cellular studies . Cells were seeded 24h before the experiment in DMEM media supplemented with 10 % FBS . We studied the uptake of single - Cy3 labelled DNs and Alexa488 labelled transferrin ( Tf - A488 ) for 20 min at 37ºC . Tf - A488 is an endocytic marker of clathrin - mediated endocytosis that served as an internal control . The concentration of Tf - A488 used was 5 µg / ml and kept constant in all the experiments . The non - treated cells were considered as a negative control for validating the internalization efficiency of DNs . The internalization of nanostructure was characterized both qualitatively and quantitatively using laser scanning confocal microscopy . The internalization of DNs was tracked using Cy3 conjugated DNA , which was incorporated during the assembly reaction . The concentration of Cy3 - DNA was constant in TD and ID , whereas the number of copies of Cy3 DNA in cube and BB was more , which was normalized by dividing the total intensity by the number of fluorophores . The non - treated cells showed negligible signal in the red 6 channel , validating that the fluorescence in the treated cells corresponds to the internalized DNs . For TD , the signal can be detected at concentrations as low as 5 nM ( Figure 2a , b ) , whereas for cube and BB the signal was visible only after 25 nM and 10 nM , respectively ( Supplementary information , Figure S2 , and S3 ) . However , ID ' s signal was significantly less than the other DNs ( Figure 2c , d ) . The signal of TD increases linearly with the concentration , whereas for Cube and BB , the signal increases till 250 nM and then decreases which may be due to either the aggregation of DNs at higher concentrations or self - inhibition on the membrane due to crowding . The images were processed and quantified using ImageJ software . We further conducted a time - dependent study ( 0 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 30 , and 60 min ) in parallel to study the cellular uptake of DNA TD over time . Initially , the intensity of TD from cells increased with time up to 15 mins , after which it started to decrease indicating the recycling of the internalized TD from the cells ( Figure 2e , f ) . Figure 2 . Cellular uptake of DNA nanostructures . ( a , c ) Confocal images of MDA - MB 231 cells treated with DNA TD - Cy3 and ID - Cy3 in different concentrations ranging from 5 nM to 500 nM .

Error bars in all quantification indicate standard errors . The normalized intensity was calculated from 40 cells ( ordinary one - way ANOVA , P value < 0 . 0001 * * * * ) . Scale Bar : 10µm . 2 . 3 . Cellular uptake of DNs is size and cell type dependent How different DNs bearing different topologies interact with complex cellular environments of different cell types can be utilized to provide a unified piece of information about the cell - specific preference of DNA nanostructures . We studied the uptake of DNs in a panel of cell lines originating from different sources and body tissues including SH - SY5Y , HeLa , SUM159 , KB3 , and RPe1 . We found 150 nM is the optimum concentration to study the cellular uptake from the previous experiment and was used for further experiments . DNs of different geometries were uptaken with varying efficiencies in SUM159 cells ( Figure 3a , b ) and other cell lines as well ( Supplementary information , Figure S4 , S5 , S6 and S7 ) . We found that DNA TD ' s uptake was higher than other DNs in all the cell lines . We further compared the internalization of TD in different cell lines to investigate if there is any tissue specific preference in the internalization of DNA TD . We found that the internalization of TD was more in the cancerous cell lines compared to the non - cancerous cell lines . Among the cancerous cell lines the internalization was maximum in breast ( SUM159 ) , kidney ( HEK293T ) and liver ( WRL ) cell lines ( Figure S8 ) . Since DNA TDs were getting internalized in all the cell types with maximum efficiency , we further investigated if the size of TD has any role to play in the internalization of DNA TDs . TDs of three different sizes were synthesized using thermal annealing protocol as described previously . The hydrodynamic size of TD was analysed by dynamic light scattering and found to be 11 . 7 nm for small TDs ( referred to as TDS ) , 14 . 3 nm for medium TDs ( referred to as TDM ) , and 32 . 7 nm for large TDs ( referred to as TDL ) ( Figure 3c ) . We did the cellular uptake studies in the SUM159 cell line at a 150 nM concentration of TD . We hypothesized that TDS will be internalized more owing to its smaller size but in contrast , we found that TDM followed by TDL has shown maximum internalization ( Figure 3d , e ) . This explains that the size of the ligand indeed has a vital role to play in the internalization of DNA nanostructures . 8 Figure 3 .

DNA TDs get endocytosed by Clathrin Mediated Endocytosis Efficient cellular uptake of the cargo is the primary requirement for delivering molecules of interest . We optimized the uptake of different DNs and concluded that of the tested geometries , TDs are most efficiently internalized in all the cell types . We further wanted to delineate the cellular pathways involved in the internalization of DNA TDs . The uptake of small ligands into cells takes place mainly via active processes like endocytosis . There are two major pathways for endocytosis broadly classified into clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) and clathrin - independent endocytosis ( CIE ) involving the clathrin machinery . Alternatively , less efficient modes such as phagocytosis are involved in the uptake of large sized structures like bacteria . However , these are not very efficient and very slow in action . Since DNA TDs are ligands of size 15nm , we ruled out the phagocytosis and used inhibitors to block the CME and CIE pathways . Pitstop - 2 is a well - studied inhibitor of the CME pathway , which interferes with the terminal domain of clathrin involved in coated pit dynamics , thereby inhibiting clathrin pit scission from the membrane and blocking vesicle transport to the endosome 28 . Lactose has been shown to compete with lectins like galectin - 3 which binds the glycosylated receptors thereby blocking the formation and uptake of clathrin independent carriers 29 . Cells were pre - treated with two different concentrations of Pitstop - 2 ( 20µM & 40µM ) to block CME process for 15mins at 37ºC specifically . Control cells and treated cells were probed to check the uptake of TD - Cy3 , Tf - A488 , and Gal3 - Cy5 after 20 min of incubation at 37ºC . For pitstop - 2 treatment , two different concentrations were tested , and the pathway got inhibited at 20 μM ; however , the cells got stressed at 40 μM . Transferrin is a well - established marker for the CME pathway and thereby was used as a positive control . Galectin - 3—known to enter the cells via the CIE pathway—was used as a negative control for Pitstop - 2 . The CME pathway got inhibited upon treatment with 20 µM of Pitstop - 2 , as confirmed by the quantitative reduction in the signal of Tf - A488 , whereas the uptake of Gal3 - Cy5 was not significantly affected . The signal from TD was significantly reduced , suggesting the internalization of TD by the CME pathway ( Figure 4a , b ) . We used another inhibitor , ' Dynasore ' to block the CME pathway to further confirm the above results . Dynasore inhibits dynamin that acts as a molecular scissor and regulates the dynamics of clathrin - coated vesicles 30 . Dynaosre inhibits the GTPase activity of dynamin which is involved in the pinching of the vesicles . The CME pathway was blocked by pre - treating the cells with 60 µM and 80 µM concentrations of Dynasore for 30 min . Again , TD uptake was significantly affected along with Tf - A488 , suggesting CM - dependent endocytosis of TDs ( Figure 4 c , d ) . However , the internalization of Gal - 3 was not severely affected . In contrast , the uptake of TDs remains unaffected mainly in cells pre - treated with lactose , a known competitive inhibitor of galectins that blocks the CIE pathway 31 ( Figure4 e , f ) . Taken together , these findings support a CME - dependent mechanism of TD internalization . We 10 additionally checked the internalization route of TD in MDA - MB231 cell lines and observed the similar trend results i . e . , upon treatment with pitstop - 2 and dynasore the internalization of TD was significantly reduced . In contrast , upon lactose treatment the internalization of TD was unaffected inferring the internalization of TD via CME process ( Figure S9 , S10 ) . Previous reports suggested the internalization of many DNs via the caveolin pathway . We employed methyl beta - cyclodextrin ( m 𝛽 CD ) inhibitor to selectively block the caveolin pathway 32 . We found that the internalization of TDs was not significantly disturbed upon treatment with m 𝛽 CD whereas the uptake of CtxB , a potential cargo for caveolin pathway was selectively inhibited 33 ( Supplementary information , Figure S11 ) . However , caveolin mediated uptake is present mainly in muscle cells and its expression is minimum in other body cells whereas clathrin mediated and independent pathways are ubiquitous in all body cell types . 11 Figure 4 .

DNA TDs stimulate 3D cell invasion in spheroid model and in vivo uptake in zebrafish model system 3D cell culture mimics cell ' s physiological environment and thus provides an improved platform to study cellular spreading , migration , invasion as well as differentiation . In 3D cell culture , cells clump together to form stable cell - to - cell contacts , thereby maximizing the communication and signalling between the cells . MDA - MB - 231 , extremely aggressive triple - negative human breast cancer cells , were used to prepare 3D spheroids using the hanging drop method . It is a non - scaffold - based method in which cell suspensions are placed dropwise on the lid of the petridish 34 . The cells aggregated due to gravity and form a compact spheroid at the base of the drop after 36 hours of culture at 37ºC . These spheroids can then be transferred to the collagen matrix to invade the 3D system . This invasion potential of the cells can be either stimulated or inhibited by using specific activators or inhibitors . We wanted to check if DNA nanostructures had any effect on the invasion potential of these spheroids . Spheroid invasion assay provides an attractive ex vivo platform to study the invasion potential of 3D DNA - based nanodevices . Cell invasion potential can be quantified by measuring the dispersion of cells in different directions or by calculating the migration distance covered by cells from the intact spheroid core . Following the characterization of uptake of different DNs in the 2D cell culture system , we then investigated the uptake of DNs in the 3D spheroid models . To evaluate the invasion potential of DNs with different topologies , we incubated the spheroids with DNs for 24 h at 37ºC . Untreated spheroids were considered as control that showed minimal invasion potential as the migration distance was negligible , and hardly any cells invaded out from the spheroid core into the collagen matrix ( Figure 5a ) . The zoom - in image of the section of spheroids also demonstrated successful endocytosis of the DNA TDs into migrating cells , thereby stimulating their invasion ( Figure 5b ) . Spheroids treated with DNs showed visible cell invasion in the matrix , the migration distance was more , and many cells migrated in different directions away from the spheroid core . Among all , TD showed the maximum invasion , followed by ID , BB and Cube ( Figure 5c ) . 13 Figure 5 . DNA TDs stimulate 3D cell invasion in spheroid model and in vivo uptake in zebrafish model system . ( a ) Confocal images of DNs uptake by MDA - MB231 spheroids after 24 hours of incubation at 37 o C . DNs have shown invasion in 3D spheroids as cells showed migration from the spheroid core .

( i ) Schematic of experimental design . 72 hpf zebrafish embryos were soaked in media containing 300nM of DN and incubated for four hours . ( ii ) Confocal images of the dissected head of 72hpf embryo showing the internalization of TD shown in red colour . Green colour represents membrane - tethered lynEGFP . ( iii ) Confocal images of the peridermal cells of zebrafish embryo showing the internalization of DNs . Scale Bar : 10µm ( e ) Quantification of DNs internalized into the peridermal cells , calculated by counting the number of DNs vesicles colocalized with WGA vesicles which is known to mark endocytosis in general . Error bars indicate the mean with associated s . d . ( two - tailed unpaired t - test . * * * p < 0 . 001 ) . For each condition n = 6 - 8 embryos were quantified and ( N ) = 2 . We further asked if the geometry of DNs has a similar impact on their uptake in the in - vivo systems as was observed in cells . We tested this by performing an in vivo uptake assay of TD and ID in zebrafish embryos , as these DNs showed the maximum invasion potential in the previous experiment . The in vivo uptake of DNs was performed in zebrafish embryos obtained from a transgenic line Tg ( cldb : : lyn - EGFP ) in which the expression of lynEGFP is driven by claudin promoter marking the membrane of peridermal cells . To check the entry of nanocages , 72 hpf ( hours post fertilization ) embryos were soaked in a solution containing 300 nM of DNs for 4h ( Figure 5d ( i ) ) , post which the embryos were washed , fixed , and imaged using confocal microscopy . Wheat germ agglutinin ( WGA ) was used as an internal control to show the potential of these DNs to overcome the mucus barrier and their successful uptake into the zebrafish peridermal cells . We observed that the internalization of TD was more compared to the ID and control . ( Figure 5d ( iii ) ) . Further quantification of the number of vesicles labelled by control , TD , and ID and colocalized with the WGA vesicles , confirmed this trend ( Figure 5e ) . Conclusions The practical applications of DNA nanodevices in biological systems are minimal and that too very coarsely characterized . This is primarily due to the lack of in - depth understanding of interactions of DNA nanodevices with biological membranes and then applying the knowledge of these interactions to develop Smart Nanoparticles for biological and biomedical applications . 15 Herein we present the basic principles showing how the geometry and size of the DNA based nanoparticles play crucial roles in interactions of the DNs with membranes leading to their very specific uptake into mammalian cells . Most of the endocytic pathways like clathrin - mediated endocytosis trigger signalling pathways like MAPK , SRCK , etc which trigger the range of activities leading to cell migration in 2D and 3D 35 , 36 . It is through this active endocytosis of DNs into the cells that trigger 3D invasion of cells from spheroids into the collagen matrix . Not only do these nanoparticles activate these physiological pathways in a geometry specific manner , but they also possess the capacity to enter epithelial cells in in - vivo systems like zebrafish embryos . Taken together , our results have established the strict influence of ligand geometries on their interactions with biological systems . These results will play crucial roles in the future development of DNA based smart nanoparticles with specific and targeted capacities to probe and program biological systems in multiple avenues like bioimaging , targeted delivery , activation of immune cells , or as scaffolds for tissue engineering , to name a few . Figure 6 . Schematic illustration of the internalization pathway potentially followed by Tetrahedral DNA in cells . Multiple pathways co - exist at plasma membrane for internalization of various cargos including nutirents , growth factors , toxins and even fluid . We successfully marked two different endocytic pathways viz clathrin dependent and independent pathways and we found that DNA nanocages of different geometries mostly adopt the clathrin mediated endocytosis . Further , the uptake of these nanocages is strongly correlated with the object ' s geometry and found that only tetrahedral geometry is more preferred for uptake in cells and in vivo . 3 .
