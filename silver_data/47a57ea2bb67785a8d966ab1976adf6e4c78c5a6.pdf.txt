The Coﬁlin Activity Pathway in Metastasizing Mammary Tumour Cells by Erin Prosk B . Sc . , McGill University , 2007 A THESIS SUBMITTED IN PARTIAL FULFILLMENT OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DEGREE OF MASTER OF SCIENCE in The Faculty of Graduate Studies ( Mathematics ) THE UNIVERSITY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA ( Vancouver ) August 2009 c (cid:13) Erin Prosk 2009 Abstract The activity of coﬁlin has been identiﬁed as a critical determinant of the metastatic potential of carcinoma cells in vivo [ 15 , 23 ] . The burst coﬁlin - mediated barbed end production following stimulation of a cancer cell with EGF is not yet completely understood [ 7 , 24 ] . This motivates the use of mathematical models to test experimental hypotheses and propose areas for future experimental consideration . In this thesis , I outline the initial temporal models of the coﬁlin activity pathway in metas - tasizing mammary tumour cells developed by myself and my supervisor Leah Edelstein - Keshet . This work results from a collaboration with experimentalist Dr . John Condeelis ( Albert Ein - stein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University ) . The project is hierarchical , building from a reduced model of coﬁlin - barbed end interaction ( Chapter 2 ) , to include distinct coﬁlin forms ( Chapter 3 ) and compartmental considerations ( Chapter 4 ) . In each model , we investigate es - sential mechanisms of the coﬁlin pathway required to reproduce the barbed end peak observed in experiment . The models presented in Chapters 2 - 4 represent the initial step in the modeling analysis of the coﬁlin activity pathway . The work serves to validate current hypotheses about the coﬁlin activity pathway and identify important interactions and considerations for future experimental and theoretical development . ii Table of Contents Abstract . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ii Table of Contents . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . iii List of Tables . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . v List of Figures . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . vi Acknowledgements . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . vii 1 Introduction . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 1 . 1 Cell Motility . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1 1 . 2 Review of Actin Dynamics . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 1 . 2 . 1 Role of Coﬁlin . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 1 . 3 Review of Experimental Data . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7 2 Reduced Model . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11 2 . 1 Motivation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11 2 . 2 Barbed End Model . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11 2 . 3 Coﬁlin Barbed End Model Details . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 2 . 3 . 1 Coﬁlin Model Assumptions . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13 2 . 4 Linear Filament Severing . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15 2 . 4 . 1 Analysis of Reduced Linear Model . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15 2 . 4 . 2 Model Scaling and Parameter Analysis . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17 2 . 4 . 3 Simulation of Reduced Linear Model . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17 2 . 4 . 4 Time -

In human physiology , cell movement encompasses such critical processes as cellular diﬀerentiation during embryogenesis , chemotaxis of immune cells , ﬁbroblast migration during wound healing , and invasion and metastatic behaviour of tumour cells . Each of these processes demands the ability of a cell to detect and respond to external signals quickly and with relative precision . Playing such a critical role in the maintainence of biological and physiological well - being , cell motility has been stationed at the forefront of both experimental and theoretical study for many years . However , much of this work has been focused on the motility of biological systems , chemotaxis of amoeboid Dictyostelium cells and ﬁsh keratocytes . These cell types , and their mechanism of movement are inherently diﬀerent than the human physiological counterparts of which a surprisingly small number of systems have been studied extensively . Most surprisingly , theoretical modeling of the migration and invasion of cancer , our popula - tion’s leading cause of death , has seen little attention until recently . Consequently , the cellular mechanisms causing and driving the progression of this dangerous disease are very poorly un - derstood . Modern advancements in ﬂuorescence microscopy imaging and parallel work in the analysis of genetic networks which determine metastatic potential of tumour cells have shone light onto the cellular pathways important for metastatic behaviour . These recent experimental discoveries demand theoretical analysis to expand on previous cell motility theories in light of the experimentally predicted similarities and distinct diﬀerences of cancer cell migration . Such understanding will be critical to determine the important cellular targets to prevent invasive 1 1 . 1 . Cell Motility migration of cancerous cells . General cell movement occurs by ﬁne coordination of several distinct and important steps . Cells initiate protrusion at the front in response to an external stimulus . They attach to avail - able substrate at the site of protrusion before contracting at the back and releasing their trailing edge . This process is repeated as the cell moves in the direction of protrusion toward an external stimulus . It is a fundamental sequence of events consistent across the wide range of motile cells . In each case , the initial step in the motility cycle requires the sensing of chemotactic signals by receptors on the surface of the cell . The activation is relayed to the interior of the cell , kicking oﬀ a complex signaling pathway . Activity culminates in polymerization of new actin at the front of the cell , generating a protrusive force to extend the membrane in the direction of motion . In this manner , the activity of the signaling pathway determines the directionality of cell movement by designating the location of the initial protrusion . The goal of this thesis is to examine one such signaling pathway , the coﬁlin activity cycle , which has been recently identiﬁed as a key component of the metastatic phenotype of mammary tumour cells [ 15 , 29 , 32 ] . This work is the result of a collaboration with Dr . John Condeelis , an experimental cell biologist , professor and co - chair of the Department of Anatomy and Structural Biology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University . His research lab has produced much of the recent experimental literature of breast cancer study in vivo , and supports the important role of the coﬁlin activity cycle . The inherent complexity of cancer cell study in vivo limits the extent of experimental un - derstanding . Discussions with John Condeelis identiﬁed the importance of deciphering an early peak of barbed end density produced by the stimulated activity cycle and critical to the directed migration of cancer cells . The current experimental shortcomings motivate our initial modeling eﬀorts . We focus initially on reproducing the barbed end peak by examining the underlying coﬁlin interactions in a simpliﬁed , temporal framework . We hope to gain insight into the im - portant interactions within the coﬁlin activity cycle , however , determining model parameters is a major challenge toward accurate representation of the system . This thesis outlines the impor - tant initial step in the analysis of the primary regulators of cancer cell metastasis . The work 2 1 . 2 . Review of Actin Dynamics described here helps to simplify the complex spatiotemporal system and provide a foundation for later models . In the next section , I will motivate our recent modeling eﬀorts by describing some experimental work from the Condeelis Lab . 1 . 2 Review of Actin Dynamics Actin exists in the cell in two very closely linked forms . As long , thin ﬁlaments , actin comprises the primary component of the cell’s cytoskeleton . The ﬁlaments are crosslinked into a network of structural scaﬀolding determining cell shape and maintaining mechanical properties , internal force and resistance within the cell . The cytoskeleton and each individual ﬁlament are dynamic structures constantly polymeriz - ing and depolymerizing via addition or loss of the monomer form of the protein , G - actin . G - actin diﬀuses freely in the cell and associates to the nucleotide ATP in the cytosol which hydrolyzes over time to ADP . Actin ﬁlaments are polar structures with distinctly higher monomer addition rates and an aﬃnity to ATP - bound G - actin at their barbed ends , and increased rate of monomer dissociation of ADP - bound G - actin at the pointed ends . In this manner , polymerizing actin ﬁl - aments will exhibit a newly formed cap of ATP - actin at the free ”barbed end” with a tail of older ADP - bound monomers trailing to the disassembling ”pointed end” . An extensive analysis of the dynamics of the actin forms and associated actin binding proteins has been studied in Mogilner and Edelstein - Keshet ( 2002 ) [ 21 ] . The dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton are controlled by a complex network of signalling pathways in the cell . The activity of these networks can be spatially separated , allowing a cell to polarize in response to an external signal . Signalling molecules such as phosphoinositides and Rho proteins can inﬂuence the activity of local actin binding proteins ( ABPs ) which up or downregulate actin polymerization in a local region of the cell . Some ABPs , which upregulation actin , do so by creating additional polymerizing barbed ends . The enhanced polymerization generates force against the membrane and causes the cell to protrude at the site of activity . The cell has three general mechanisms to create new free barbed ends : ( 1 ) uncapping of inhibited barbed ends by release of capping protein or release of bound gelsolin [ 18 , 30 ] , ( 2 ) nu - 3 1 . 2 . Review of Actin Dynamics cleation of new ﬁlaments by the Arp2 / 3 complex [ 26 ] , or ( 3 ) severing of existing older ﬁlaments by coﬁlin [ 7 ] . The activity of these proteins is tightly regulated in a cell to maintain dynamic stability of the actin cytoskeleton . The regulation of each protein can occur via pathways which are strongly interconnected , or by independent mechanisms , depending on the cell type studied and on the system of chemoattractant sensing within the cell . Here we study the regulation of just one such protein , the control of coﬁlin activity in the rat MTLn3 mammary adenocarcinoma cell line , an experimental model for the study of breast cancer cells . 1 . 2 . 1 Role of Coﬁlin As cancer develops in the body , carcinoma cells undergo many stages of mutations . Early cell mutations increase proliferation at the cancer site , creating tumours . As the disease progresses , later mutations promote the abnormal migration of these normally non - motile cells , which can metastasize , or invade blood vessels causing the disease to spread to other tissues . The activity status of coﬁlin has been shown to be distinctly diﬀerent between strictly proliferating non - motile tumour cells and those which exhibit metastatic potential [ 24 , 32 ] . Furthermore , recent work in vivo has identiﬁed that local coﬁlin activity is necessary for directional sensing and determines direction of cell motility [ 15 , 23 ] . Coﬁlin binding to actin ﬁlaments occurs via its Ser - 3 binding site . Under certain cellular conditions , the ﬁlament - bound coﬁlin can instill suﬃcient force on the ﬁlament to create a break . Coﬁlin associates to older segments of actin ﬁlaments where monomers are ADP - associated . This means that unlike binding and nucleation activity of the Arp2 / 3 complex , ﬁlament severing by coﬁlin is not restricted to the newly assembled ﬁlament cap , and does not require ﬁlaments to be actively polymerizing at all . Coﬁlin can bind and sever a capped mother ﬁlament , creating a new barbed end site for polymerizing of the daughter ﬁlament . This introduces the possibility of synergistic interactions between coﬁlin and Arp2 / 3 activity whereby the recently severed and polymerizing ﬁlament tips produced by coﬁlin are available for Arp2 / 3 nucleation [ 13 ] . Coﬁlin has been shown in vitro to bind ﬁlaments cooperatively [ 1 , 3 , 11 ] . This behaviour 4 1 . 2 . Review of Actin Dynamics is yet to be proven in living cells . However , cooperative eﬀects are expected to occur due to the increased torsional ﬂexibility of actin ﬁlaments upon coﬁlin binding [ 27 ] . It is strongly hy - pothesized by experimentalists that between 5 and 7 bound coﬁlin molecules are required in vivo to generate suﬃcient force to create a break ( informal discussions with J . Condeelis and J . van Rheenen ) . This is supported by studies that examine structural force dynamics of coﬁlin binding [ 1 , 27 ] . Inactivation of coﬁlin occurs by inhibition of the Ser - 3 site , preventing binding to actin ﬁla - ments and any consequent severing activity [ 22 ] . Cellular coﬁlin binds both G - actin monomers , and phosphate molecules at the same Ser - 3 site with high aﬃnity [ 28 , 31 ] . Furthermore , coﬁlin is known to bind PIP 2 at the membrane of a cell . Structural studies have shown the PIP 2 - binding site to overlap with the ﬁlament binding Ser - 3 site [ 16 ] . In this manner , cellular coﬁlin can be inactivated , that is , its ﬁlament - severing activity is inhibited , by monomer - binding , phosphory - lation , and PIP 2 - binding at the membrane . These inactive forms of coﬁlin are relatively stable in a resting cell . In general , reactivation of coﬁlin requires a recycling process involving cellular complexes to strip monomers ( SSH or CIN ) , facilitate dephosphorylation ( LIM kinase ) or cleave PIP 2 ( PLC - γ ) . Gradient sensing and chemotaxis of tumour cells is hypothesized to occur via a local exci - tation , global inhibition ( LEGI ) model [ 23 , 25 , 34 ] . Local activation of coﬁlin activity has been shown to occur by a PLC - mediated release of PIP 2 - bound coﬁlin at the membrane of the cell [ 33 ] , and is not spatially or temporally correlated to dephosphorylation [ 31 ] . Upon stimulation with chemoattractant , epidermal growth factor , or EGF , LIM kinase activity increases globally in the cell , increasing the phosphorylation and deactivation of coﬁlin [ 31 ] . Such a LEGI model facilitates a tight control of protrusion sites and allows the cell to accomplish precise directional sensing . The coﬁlin activity pathway of metastasizing tumour cells is well motivated and explained in the recent review by van Rheenen et . al ( 2009 ) [ 32 ] . We use the qualitative structure described in Figure 1 . 1 together with data from recent experimental work ( outlined in the Section 1 . 3 ) to quantify cellular interactions and underlying mechanisms of the observed burst of barbed end 5 1 . 2 . Review of Actin Dynamics density . These initial simple models provide a framework on which to extend further work in the ﬁeld . Figure 1 . 1 : Coﬁlin molecules cycle through three compartments in the cell ; the cytosol , the actin , and the PM compartments . Coﬁlin at the membrane ( PM compartment ) initially translocates to the F - actin compartment upon EGF mediated PIP 2 reduction . Coﬁlin binds and severs actin ﬁlaments resulting in ﬁlaments with free barbed ends , and coﬁlinG - actin complex . The coﬁlinG - actin complex cannot bind actin or PM , and therefore diﬀuses to the cytosol compartment . In the cytosol compartment , coﬁlin is phosphorylated by LIM - kinase ( LIMK ) , resulting in the release of coﬁlin from the coﬁlinG - actin complex . Upon coﬁlin dephosphorylation by SSH , coﬁlin can reenter the membrane ( PM ) or F - actin compartment , starting a new cycle . The cycling of coﬁlin through the three compartments increases free barbed ends , resulting in newly polymerized actin ﬁlaments . The Arp2 / 3 complex prefers to bind to these newly formed actin ﬁlaments , which ampliﬁes the coﬁlin - induced actin polymerization , resulting in protrusion formation [ 32 , 33 ] .

Review of Experimental Data 1 . 3 Review of Experimental Data Recent work has identiﬁed and quantiﬁed the impact of coﬁlin activity in the rat MTLn3 car - cinoma cell line . This cell type has been chosen for study due to the PLC - dependency of coﬁlin - induced barbed end formation , protrusion and chemotaxis [ 23 ] , and the correlation of coﬁlin activity with the metastatic potential of the cell [ 34 ] . Experimental work utilizing recent developments in multiphoton ﬂuorescence imaging and MTLn3 cell properties has demonstrated the critical role of the coﬁlin pathway in invasive tu - mour cells in vivo . The cycle initiates via an increase in activity of PLC - γ in the membrane of the cell upon EGF stimulation [ 24 ] . This induces a rapid and signiﬁcant reduction of PIP 2 into diacylglycerol ( DAG ) and inositoltrisphosphate ( IP 3 ) in the membrane . Coﬁlin has been shown to be in rapid equilibrium with PIP 2 in a strong and stable con - ﬁguration at the membrane of a cell . This relatively high fraction of cellular coﬁlin is reduced signiﬁcantly upon EGF stimulation . The experimental time proﬁles of these phenomena are shown in Figure 1 . 2 . We use these to ﬁt PLC and PIP 2 dynamics of our models described in Chapters 3 and 4 of this thesis . Figure 1 . 2 : Left : Dynamics of PLC from Figure 2 A of Mouneimne ( 2004 ) [ 24 ] . Right : Dy - namics of PIP 2 from Figure 1 A of van Rheennen ( 2007 ) [ 33 ] .

Review of Experimental Data Until recent developments in microscopy , coﬁlin dynamics were studied in vitro where cellu - lar interactions and pathway dynamics may be signiﬁcantly diﬀerent . Consequently , though the dynamics we study here are strongly supported by experimental studies [ 32 ] , the collection of quantiﬁed temporal data of coﬁlin in its various cellular forms is less complete . We are cautious of using the extensive in vitro library of work to validate our model . Much of the study of ﬁlament binding dynamics , especially the extensive analysis of coﬁlin binding and severing actin ﬁlaments has been under in vitro conditions [ 1 , 4 , 11 , 17 ] . Instead , we focus on the ﬁlament binding data described in van Rheenen ( 2007 ) where coﬁlin is released from the membrane upon EGF stimulation , and binds rapidly to membrane - associated ﬁlaments ( < 200 n m from the membrane ) [ 33 ] . We work under the assumption motivated by data in van Rheenen ( 2007 ) , whereby ﬁlament - bound coﬁlin increases less than two - fold following stimulation with EGF . This is shown in Figure 1 . 3 . Figure 1 . 3 : Relative increase in ﬁlament - bound coﬁlin at 0s and 60s following stimulation with EGF , from Figure 5 A of van Rheennen ( 2007 ) [ 33 ] . Reprinted with permission from J van Rheenen EGF - induced PIP 2 hydrolysis releases and activates coﬁlin locally in carcinoma cells . Journal of Cell Biology 179 ( 6 ) : 1247 - 59 ( 2007 ) . As described in previous sections , this relatively small fold increase in coﬁlin activity ( in the form of bound coﬁlin ) induces an ampliﬁcation of barbed end production in the cell . Within 60s following stimulation with EGF , the relative number of free polymerizing barbed ends in the cell increases to a magnitude up to a 12 - fold greater than the barbed end density at rest [ 24 ] . This increase is highly dependent on experimental conditions such as temperature , and pH changes induced by the activity of other signaling networks in the cell , The increase in barbed 8 1 . 3 . Review of Experimental Data end density is stated as an average of 2 . 7 and 3 . 2 fold increases in other studies [ 15 , 19 ] . Within a simple modeling framework , we attempt to reproduce these quantiﬁed barbed end ampliﬁca - tions . An example of maximal barbed end ampliﬁcation , for optimal cellular conditions is shown in Figure 1 . 4 , from Mouneimne ( 2004 ) [ 24 ] . The early peak of barbed end density at 60s following stimulation with EGF has been shown to be a product of PLC - mediated coﬁlin activity in the cell . The later peak , at 180s after stim - ulation , is dependent on the Arp2 / 3 pathway regulated by PI3 kinase ( PI3K ) in both amoeboid D . discoideum and carcinoma cells [ 8 ] . Figure 1 . 5 exhibits this phenomenon by quantifying barbed ends , under two conditions : control vs PLC - inhibited . The early peak of barbed ends is coﬁlin dependent and is suﬃcient to determine direction of cell motility in carcinoma cells . This motivates the focus our attention on the analysis of the coﬁlin pathway and resulting peak of barbed end density 60s following stimulation with EGF [ 15 ] .

In the following chapters , I will describe our eﬀorts to quantify the eﬀect of the coﬁlin activity cycle on the actin cytoskeleton at the leading edge . The models are hierarchical , expanding from a simple reduced coﬁlin - barbed end model , to a complex model framework describing interactions between distinct coﬁlin forms and transitions between cellular compartments . Chapter 2 ﬁrst describes a reduced model which examines the interaction between the density of a single coﬁlin form , termed active coﬁlin for its ﬁlament severing ability , and production of barbed ends . Chapter 3 introduces a closed temporal model of coﬁlin transitioning between various forms in a well - mixed cell , and the consequent impact on cytoskeletal dynamics . Finally , Chapter 4 expands the coﬁlin cycle model to include some spatial considerations by dividing the cell into edge and interior compartments , while still maintaining temporal dynamics in the equations . I will also outline the diﬀerent levels of complexity in the number of coﬁlin interactions we have examined in each model . Finally , in Chapter 5 , I will discuss the conclusions made from this work , and the proposed areas for both experimental and theoretical future study . 10 Chapter 2 Reduced Coﬁlin Barbed End Model 2 . 1 Motivation Coﬁlin is known to sever ﬁlaments under speciﬁc cell conditions . The severing events create an increase in free barbed ends which can polymerize and create protrusive forces . It has been shown that coﬁlin activity is directly linked to spatial localization of directed movement of the cell [ 15 ] . In this chapter , I outline our examination of the relationship between coﬁlin activity and free barbed ends with a simpliﬁed model . Using the information outlined in Section 1 . 3 , we attempt to reproduce the signal ampliﬁcation using a variety of modeling techniques to capture the biological properties of the coﬁlin activity cycle . 2 . 2 Barbed End Model Under the most general and simplest considerations , free , polymerizing barbed ends are produced by a variety of actin - binding proteins , including coﬁlin , in the cell . The rate of barbed end production is tightly regulated in a resting cell , such that the base production rate P B , rest can be considered constant . Growing barbed ends are lost due to binding of capping proteins at a rate proportional to barbed end density . We consider a constant capping rate , k cap based on a near constant lifetime of barbed ends in the cell , k cap ≈ 1 s − 1 [ 26 ] . We deﬁne barbed end density in the cell as B ( t ) , expressed in units of number per µ m 3 . Barbed end dynamics in a resting cell are described by the proposed equation dB dt = P B , rest − k cap B . ( 2 . 1 ) 11 2 . 3 . Coﬁlin Barbed End Model Details This allows a simple identiﬁcation of the resting steady state level of barbed ends , since if ˙ B = 0 , then B rest = P B , rest k cap . Without an applied stimulus , the system approaches this resting state asymptotically , from any initial level of barbed ends B ( 0 ) . Suppose that upon stimulation , production of barbed ends increases from P B , rest to P B , stim . Through the same analysis , the steady state barbed end level under stimulated conditions will be B stim = P B , stim k cap , where P B , stim > P B , rest . Here we ignore any transition period between the two states of pro - duction , considering a stepwise increase in production rate from rest to stimulated conditions . This models an instantaneous increase in activity of actin - binding proteins in the cell . The stimulated steady state is also asymptotically stable , and barbed end levels will approach B stim as long as the production rate remains at P B , stim . If the stimulus is removed and barbed end production returns to the level P B , rest , the barbed end density decreases back to B rest . The magnitude of increase in barbed end production and barbed end level is dependent on the ratio between resting and stimulated states since the condition B stim B rest ≤ P B , stim P B , rest ( 2 . 2 ) must be satisﬁed for all time . Thus , the ratio of production rates , P B , stim / P B , rest , determines the maximum ampliﬁcation of barbed ends . Barbed end density will reach maximum ampliﬁ - cation only if the stimulus is applied for suﬃcient time . 2 . 3 Coﬁlin Barbed End Model Details Shown in Figure 1 . 2 in Section 1 . 3 , EGF stimulation of MTLn3 cells can induce up to a 10 - 15 fold increase in barbed end density within 60 s following stimulation . This has been shown to be dependent on the coﬁlin pathway and independent of the activity status of other ABPs in the 12 2 . 3 . Coﬁlin Barbed End Model Details cell [ 13 ] . We deﬁne the coﬁlin concentration that is active in severing ﬁlaments as C ( t ) usually expressed in units of µM . We propose the following general formulation for a mini model of coﬁlin and barbed ends dC dt = f ( C , B ) , dB dt = g ( C , B ) , where B ( t ) is the density of barbed ends ( usually in number per µ m 2 ) . 2 . 3 . 1 Coﬁlin Model Assumptions • The early and late peaks of barbed end levels , at 60s and 180s following stimulus with EGF are dependent on coﬁlin and Arp2 / 3 respectively [ 13 , 24 ] . The respective pathways are independent of one another , as shown in the data reprinted here in Figure 1 . 5 [ 13 ] . • Barbed ends are produced by the activity of actin - binding proteins in the cell at rest . There is no apparent feedback between barbed ends and their own rate of production ( as discussed previously ) . The increase in barbed end production under stimulated conditions is assumed to be strictly due to increased activity of coﬁlin . Our simple barbed end equation ( Equation 2 . 1 ) applies here with a coﬁlin - dependent barbed end production rate , P B , stim = P B , stim ( C ) . • The observed 10 - 15 fold increase at 60 s demands ampliﬁcation upstream of the barbed end dynamics . We assume here that this stems from the activity of coﬁlin . • Severing events occur at low frequency in resting cells as several ( between 5 - 7 ) bound coﬁlin molecules are required to sever an actin ﬁlament . Coﬁlin has been shown in vitro to exhibit cooperative binding and severing properties [ 1 , 11 ] . Following a severing event , coﬁlin molecules are left in an inactive , monomer - bound form which must be recycled on a longer time scale before being reactivated [ 31 , 33 ] . In this simpliﬁed model , the coﬁlin concentration C ( t ) ( in µM ) is in a form bound to the actin ﬁlaments , available to cut provided required conditions are met . We address distinct coﬁlin forms , active and inactive , in Chapters 3 and 4 . 13 2 . 3 . Coﬁlin Barbed End Model Details We identify that coﬁlin can be activated at some time dependent rate in the cell , A C ( t ) , which we assume to be dependent on some external factor . Coﬁlin is deactivated at a rate k off C proportional to its concentration . We assume that coﬁlin also loses its activated status after a severing event at a rate dependent on its concentration F sev ( C ) , as in Figure 1 . 1 from van Rheenen ( 2009 ) , coﬁlin is released from the daughter ﬁlament in an inactive , monomer - bound form . We use a barbed end equation of a form similar to Equation 2 . 1 . We introduce the production of barbed ends by coﬁlin severing at a rate proportional to the rate of coﬁlin loss αF sev ( C ) . We propose the following system to represent interactions between coﬁlin activity and barbed ends in the cell dC dt = A C − k off C − F sev ( C ) , dB dt = P B + αF sev ( C ) − k cap B . ( 2 . 3 ) Here A C = A C ( t ) is the stimulus dependent activation rate of severing coﬁlin , k off is a de - activation rate constant , F sev ( C ) is the coﬁlin - dependent severing rate which removes active coﬁlin from the system and increases barbed end density , α is a conversion factor between units of coﬁlin and barbed end density , and converts loss of coﬁlin activity into barbed end density produced ( calculations shown in the Appendix ) . We recognize that coﬁlin can be reactivated via a recycling process of inactivated coﬁlin , but we neglect this eﬀect in this model as we consider this contribution to coﬁlin activity to be low within the relatively short time frame of the early barbed end peak [ 31 , 33 ] . 14 2 . 4 . Linear Filament Severing 2 . 4 Linear Filament Severing We propose a constant , basal level of coﬁlin activity in a resting cell , A C , rest . We ﬁrst examine a simple linear severing rate such that new barbed ends are produced at a rate proportional to the concentration of active coﬁlin dC dt = A C − k off C − k sev C , dB dt = P B + αk sev C − k cap B . ( 2 . 4 ) where k sev is the severing constant . Based on this severing rate and Equations 2 . 4 , the basal level of coﬁlin activity in a resting cell is C rest = A C , rest k off + k sev . ( 2 . 5 ) Coﬁlin activity increases upon stimulation with EGF [ 33 ] . We model this phenomenon by introducing temporal EGF dependence to the activation rate A C ( t ) =   A C , stim · EGF when stimulated by EGF , A C , rest otherwise , ( 2 . 6 ) where A C , stim · EGF > A C , rest . While the EGF stimulus is switched on , the concentration of active coﬁlin approaches the stimulated steady state value C stim = A C , stim k off + k sev . 2 . 4 . 1 Analysis of Reduced Linear Model Similar to the barbed end relationship described previously , under these assumptions the max - imum increase in coﬁlin activity is dependent on the relative increase in activation rates C ( t ) C rest ≤ C stim C rest = A C , stim A C , rest . 15 2 . 4 . Linear Filament Severing Equations 2 . 4 imply a resting barbed end production rate P B , rest = P B + α · k sev C rest , where P B > 0 is the production of barbed ends by actin - binding proteins in the cell . The overall barbed end production increases upon stimulation to P B , stim = P B + α · k sev C stim . From Equations 2 . 4 , the resting barbed end density is deﬁned as B rest = P B + αk sev C rest k cap , ( 2 . 7 ) and stimulated steady state B stim = P B + α · k sev C stim k cap . Thus , the relative increase in barbed ends is bounded by the relationship B ( t ) B rest ≤ B stim B rest = P B + α · k sev C stim P B + α · k sev C rest . In order to capture the 10 - 15 fold increase in barbed ends shown in Figure 1 . 4 , B ( t ) B rest ≈ 10 - 15 . However , from Figure 2 of van Rheenen ( 2007 ) , shown in Figure 1 . 3 in Chapter 1 , the coﬁlin activity , recognized as the concentration of coﬁlin that is ﬁlament - bound and ready to sever , increases only by 2 - fold during the ﬁrst 60 s after EGF stimulation [ 33 ] . This restricts the magniﬁcation of barbed ends to be less than a 2 - fold increase , since B ( t ) B rest ≤ P B + 2 · α · k sev C rest P B + α · k sev C rest ≤ 2 . This analytic analysis suggests a limitation of the linear model . We predict that the model will fail to generate barbed end increases of of greater than two - fold for the applied two - fold increase in coﬁlin concentration . These predictions can be tested by model simulations . 16 2 . 4 . Linear Filament Severing 2 . 4 . 2 Model Scaling and Parameter Analysis We scale the reduced linear model , Equations 2 . 4 , by their rest steady states , shown in Equations 2 . 5 and 2 . 7 . After some algebra and simpliﬁcations , we obtain simpliﬁed equations in nondi - mensional variables , C ( t ) = C rest · c ( t ) and B ( t ) = B rest · b ( t ) , to obtain simpliﬁed equations in nondimensional variables dc dt = ( k off + k sev ) [ ˜ A C − c ] db dt = Ak sev [ c − 1 ] − k cap [ b − 1 ] ( 2 . 8 ) where k off , k sev are as described previously ( in s − 1 ) , ˜ A C = A C , stim / A C , rest is the scaled coﬁlin stimulation rate , and the scaling parameter A is A = αC rest B rest . These simpliﬁcations reduce the number of parameters required for simulations . We test a range of scaled stimulation rates to obtain coﬁlin fold increase of 1 . 2 - 2 . 0 upon stimulation , as suggested in van Rheenen ( 2007 ) ( shown in Figure 1 . 3 of this thesis ) . We approximate the coﬁlin oﬀ - rate , k off , to generate these coﬁlin proﬁles . We use a low severing rate parameter ( k sev ) as motivated by discussions with J . Condeelis and similar to the predicted value in vitro [ 1 , 11 ] . The parameter A is calculated from work shown in the Appendix and approximations from the literature [ 19 , 26 ] . These values are summarized in Table 2 . 1 2 . 4 . 3 Simulation of Reduced Linear Model Using the parameters outlined in Table 2 . 1 , results of linear model simulations are shown in Figures 2 . 1 and 2 . 2 . The barbed end dynamics follow the coﬁlin concentrations , but exhibit an increase of less than two - fold . This is governed by the low increase in the linear severing rate . 2 . 4 . 4 Time - Dependent Stimulation A more accurate representation of the EGF - induced increase in coﬁlin activity can be obtained by applying a stimulation rate which is linearly time dependent . This introduces a more gradual 17 2 . 4 .

Nonlinear Filament Severing 2 . 5 Nonlinear Filament Severing Based on the limitations of the coﬁlin model with linear severing rate , we propose a nonlinear severing rate as predicted by experimental work [ 1 ] . It has been identiﬁed that more than one bound coﬁlin molecule may be required to apply the torsional force necessary to create a break in an actin ﬁlament [ 27 ] . The kinetics of a such a severing event can be described by the simple schematic nC + F → B + nC i , where n is the number of molecules required to create a break , usually 5 - 7 . The notation C i represents an inactive form of coﬁlin , a product of a severing event , the dynamics of which will not be considered here . These kinetics suggest the existence of a cooperative eﬀect within the severing function , and motivate a nonlinear severing function . For example , consider a resting coﬁlin activity concen - tration where the equilibrium ready to sever state is 4 molecules per ﬁlament . Severing events would occur rarely at rest . An increase in the density of bound molecules upon stimulation to a state of 6 molecules per ﬁlament causes a substantial increase in severing frequency . Typical biochemical assumptions motivate saturable kinetics in the form of a Hill function . We believe coﬁlin dynamics to be far from the region of saturation in vivo , and here use a severing rate proportional to C n . Our examination of saturable kinetics is described brieﬂy in Section 2 . 5 . 2 , and provides supporting evidence for our assumptions . We propose a nonlinear severing rate function where severing is low at rest conditions and increases when coﬁlin is elevated above rest concentrations . These conditions suggest an appro - priate severing function for the coﬁlin - barbed end model in Equation 2 . 3 of the form F sev ( C ) = k sev C rest (cid:18) C C rest (cid:19) n , ( 2 . 10 ) where n ≈ 5 - 7 and k sev is a small constant . We assume the severing rate at rest , F sev ( C rest ) = k sev C rest to be low . 21 2 . 5 . Nonlinear Filament Severing Under these considerations , the coﬁlin - barbed end model takes the form dC dt = A C − k off C − k sev C rest (cid:18) C C rest (cid:19) n , dB dt = P B + αk sev C rest (cid:18) C C rest (cid:19) n − k cap B . . ( 2 . 11 ) At rest , barbed end production rate proposed earlier is of similar form P B , rest = P B + α · k sev C rest , where if k sev < < 1 s − 1 , coﬁlin severing events are insigniﬁcant compared to the barbed end production by other actin binding proteins . Notice that under such a model , even slight increases in coﬁlin activity above resting levels will be ampliﬁed so that here the stimulated severing rate is higher than the linear rate function for given resting severing rate k sev . Solving for the resting steady state of active coﬁlin , we ﬁnd the same relationship for rest state coﬁlin activity C rest = A C , rest k off + k sev , and at rest the barbed end density is B rest = P B + α · k sev C rest k cap . Similar to the procedure in the previous section , scaling Equations 2 . 11 by the resting con - centrations of coﬁlin and barbed ends , so that C = C rest · c and B = B rest · b , simplifying and rearranging terms , obtains the system dc dt = k off [ ˜ A C − c ] + k sev [ ˜ A C − c n ] , db dt = Ak sev [ c n − 1 ] − k cap [ b − 1 ] . ( 2 . 12 ) where ˜ A C = A C / A C , rest and steady states of these equations are now c = 1 and b = 1 . 22 2 . 5 . Nonlinear Filament Severing Expressed in this form , we notice the impact of the nonlinear severing rate . If the severing rate constant k sev is low , as expected from experimental work [ 33 ] , coﬁlin severing activity is low at rest conditions in the cell . Upon stimulation , ˜ A C > 1 , and coﬁlin activity increases above rest levels . This increases severing of ﬁlaments signiﬁcantly and barbed end density is ampli - ﬁed . While the coﬁlin stimulus is turned on , the system is unstable and activity will increase exponentially , thereby causing exponential increase in barbed end density . This continues until the stimulus is removed and severing activity reduces back to basal resting level . 2 . 5 . 1 Simulation of Reduced Nonlinear Model Simulations of Equations 2 . 4 are shown in Figures 2 . 5 and 2 . 6 , with an applied nonlinear sev - ering rate , linear stimulus as in Section 2 . 4 . 4 , and with parameter values described in Table 2 . 2 , can capture the 10 - 15 fold barbed end ampliﬁcation . The ampliﬁcation can be achieved with biologically reasonable parameter values and for increases in coﬁlin activity in the range of 1 . 5 - 2 . 0 fold increase . The results are robust to model parameters k off and k sev . The impact of the nonlinear assumption is exempliﬁed in the proﬁle of the function αF sev ( C ) . The magnitude of the severing rate , approximately one at rest conditions , increases several orders of magnitude with elevated coﬁlin activity . This generates the observed ampliﬁcation of barbed end density . This model represents a system far from saturation where ﬁlament - binding of coﬁlin is unlim - ited . The results can be viewed in the coﬁlin - barbed end phase plane Figure 2 . 6 , where barbed end ampliﬁcation is demonstrated with respect to coﬁlin activity . Notice increases in barbed end production are slight for coﬁlin activity just above resting levels . However , nonlinear eﬀects take over as coﬁlin activity is increased up to the two - fold ampliﬁcation . 23 2 . 5 .

Nonlinear Filament Severing 2 . 5 . 2 Nonlinear Filament Severing with Saturation We considered the possibility of saturation in the dependence of actin ﬁlament severing on coﬁlin concentration . Saturable kinetics can be incorporated into the ﬁlament severing rate by introducing a Hill function of the form F sev ( C ) = γ max k sev C rest C n C n + K , ( 2 . 13 ) where n = 7 is the nonlinear factor or Hill coeﬃcient , K is a saturation coeﬃcient in units µM , and γ max is a nondimensional parameter to scale the resting severing rate k sev C rest of Section 2 . 5 to the saturated or maximum severing rate γ max k sev C rest . The reduced model can be scaled and simpliﬁed in terms of the saturable severing rate , following a similar procedure to that described in the previous section . Forgoing the algebraic details , we emphasize that under this severing rate assumption , barbed end ampliﬁcation loses its robustness to parameters . Barbed end ampliﬁcation in the 10 - 15 fold range is obtained strictly within a small window of the γ max k sev parameter space . This range is shown in the left panel of Figure 2 . 7 where relatively high parameter settings are required ( compared to experi - mental predictions [ 1 , 11 ] ) . The source of this model limitation is due to an increase in the severing rate at rest , and reduction of stimulated severing in certain parameter regions . This prevents increases of several orders of magnitude required to generate substantial ampliﬁcation of barbed end density . The ﬁlament severing rate for rest concentration of coﬁlin is shown in the right panel of Figure 2 . 7 for the same range of parameter space . The results of this applied severing rate , together with the experimental studies of ﬁlament binding concentrations and severing rates in vitro suggest that the increases in coﬁlin activity observed in living cells may be far from the potential regions of saturation . These conclusions suggest that the nonlinear severing rate described in Section 2 . 5 is a plausible severing function for future model expansions . 26 2 . 5 .

According to John Condeelis , and as outlined in several publications from his group [ 13 , 24 , 31 , 32 ] , the early transient peak at 60 s after EGF stimulation is due to an increase in coﬁlin activity caused by a PLC - mediated release of PIP 2 - bound inactive coﬁlin at the membrane of the cell ( shown in Figure 1 . 5 in Section 1 . 3 ) . The coﬁlin released upon stimulation is in an active form , ready to sever actin . It immediately translocates to bind to uninhibited membrane - associated actin ﬁlaments [ 33 ] . In this chapter , we expand the reduced coﬁlin activity model of Chapter 2 to analyse the dynamics of coﬁlin in its various cellular forms . We introduce cellular interactions and tran - sitions between coﬁlin forms , some active in ﬁlament severing , others inactive , to quantify the mechanisms responsible for the observed coﬁlin - dependent protrusion . We follow the conclu - sions of the work in van Rheenen et . al ( 2007 ) , and use recent supporting data to reproduce the observed peak of barbed ends . We apply the results of the reduced model of Chapter 2 to identify the ﬁlament - severing rate necessary to generate suﬃcient signal ampliﬁcation . We work with a closed model of the coﬁlin cycle , whereby coﬁlin exists in one of several proposed forms . We include slow recycling steps of the inactive coﬁlin forms via actin monomer - stripping and phosphorylation - dephosphorylation processes . These processes are facilitated by complexes including phosphatases such as SSH or CIN , and on LIM kinase ( LIMK ) , but we will 28 3 . 1 . Introduction consider constant complex activity here . We use temporal data of coﬁlin interactions to validate model assumptions where available . Following Figure 1 . 1 from van Rheenen ( 2007 ) , we propose a temporal model of the coﬁlin cycle as outlined in Figure 3 . 1 .

This releases the coﬁlin from the membranous PIP 2 - bound pool ( C 2 ) to an active form ( pool C A ) , from which it can attach to actin ﬁlaments ( pool C F ) . Once the ﬁlament is severed , coﬁlin comes oﬀ , carrying an actin monomer ( pool C M ) with it . It is phosphorylated by LIM kinase into the form C P , and then stripped of its monomer , so that it could reattach to PIP 2 . Here we have also assumed that the active coﬁlin can exchange with the ﬁlament bound form or be phosphorylated . 29 3 . 1 . Introduction 3 . 1 . 1 Assumptions Expanding on the assumptions of the reduced coﬁlin barbed end model of Chapter 2 , we work with the following conditions . • We consider here only temporal dynamics , and are thereby approximating the cell as a well - mixed system where coﬁlin concentrations are averaged across the cell , and molecules move freely between the cytosolic and peripheral compartments of the cell . In this model , we neglect spatial considerations . • Coﬁlin is conserved in the system , so that cellular coﬁlin exists in one of the forms proposed here and their sum is constant , equal to the total concentration of coﬁlin in the cell . That is , for all time t , our system satisﬁes the equation C 2 ( t ) + C A ( t ) + C F ( t ) + C M ( t ) + C P ( t ) = C tot . ( 3 . 1 ) It is convenient to relate all coﬁlin pools to the fraction of total coﬁlin in the cell . Ex - perimental data is expressed relative to average coﬁlin concentration C tot , rather than in absolute concentrations . Scaling respective coﬁlin forms with respect to C tot , such that c i ( t ) = C tot · C i ( t ) obtains the dimensionless conservation equation c 2 ( t ) + c a ( t ) + c f ( t ) + c m ( t ) + c p ( t ) = 1 , ( 3 . 2 ) for all time t . At this point we neglect compartmental volume considerations , all coﬁlin forms are as - sumed to be well - mixed within the domain . This conservation equation will be examined and modiﬁed in further models . However , here we use this simple equation to gain rough insight into model behaviour . • We assume that actin ﬁlaments are abundant and at constant density within the domain . We consider an actin binding rate dependent only on available coﬁlin , and combine the rate constant as ( k on F ) . We assume ﬁlament severing to be independent of ﬁlament density . • Stimulated production of barbed ends is assumed to be coﬁlin dependent . We assume , as 30 3 . 2 . Model Development before , that barbed ends do not feed back on their own production . We use the equations proposed in Section 2 . 5 to govern barbed end dynamics . 3 . 2 Model Development The model considered here is closely based on Figure 3 . 1 . We identify the coﬁlin concentration active in ﬁlament - severing , C , of the reduced model , as the concentration of ﬁlament bound coﬁlin C F , in this model framework . In this section , I motivate and describe the equations of component of the system . Readers can skip to Section 3 . 3 for a summary of model equations . Under the simplest assumptions , for a resting cell , we consider basal rates of activation , I G , and basal deactivation rates proportional to concentrations , − d G G . A typical substance with concentration G ( t ) would satisfy the equation dG dt = I G − d G G . To such equations , we add various linear and nonlinear terms to account for interconversion and stimulation eﬀects . Unless otherwise stated , component concentrations are measured in micro - molar values , ( µM ) , where 1 µM ≈ 6 · 10 17 molec L − 1 . We also consider a closed system of coﬁlin , so that the sum of coﬁlin in all forms is a constant , as in Equation 3 . 1 . 1 . Dynamics of PLC Activity : We start analysis by quantifying phospholipase - C ( PLC ) activity and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P2 ( PIP 2 ) dynamics , as the experimental time proﬁles of these reg - ulators are well - documented , shown in Figure 1 . 2 . Furthermore , PLC activity represents the kicking - oﬀ point for our simulations , initiating the cascade of downstream transient states . We assume a basal level of production and decay of PLC activity in a resting cell . We introduce an enhanced production rate of active PLC , which is dependent on presence of an EGF stimulus . Once the EGF signal is turned oﬀ , the active PLC concentration settles down to its resting state , and consequently each coﬁlin pool returns to resting state on their respective time scales . 31 3 . 2 . Model Development The proposed equation for PLC dynamics is dPLC dt = I stimPLC ( t ) (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) stimulated activation + I PLC − d PLC PLC (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) basal rates , ( 3 . 3 ) where I PLC is a constant base level of PLC activation in the cell and d PLC is a deactivation rate . The term I stimPLC ( t ) represents the enhanced PLC activation rate due to stimulation by external factors , here , EGF . We propose a stimulation term of the form I stimPLC ( t ) =   I stim · EGF when stimulated by EGF , 0 otherwise . , where stimulation by EGF is represented by a Heaviside ( step ) function EGF ( t ) = H ( t − t on ) − H ( t − t off ) . In the absence of external stimulation , I stimPLC = 0 , and PLC activity is at its resting level PLC rest = I PLC d PLC . We normalize equation 3 . 3 in terms of this resting value , PLC ( t ) = PLC rest · plc ( t ) , where plc ( t ) is a dimensionless variable . Equation 3 . 3 becomes dplc dt = d PLC ( ˜ I stimPLC ( t ) + 1 − plc ) , ( 3 . 4 ) where ˜ I stimPLC ( t ) = I stimPLC ( t ) I PLC , is a ratio of elevated activation rate to basal activation . These parameters can be ﬁt well using data from Mouneimne ( 2004 ) [ 24 ] , outlined in Section 3 . 4 . 1 . 2 . Dynamics of PIP 2 : Similarly , we assume that a basal membrane concentration of the phosphoinositide PIP 2 exists in a resting cell . PIP 2 is known to bind and inactivate coﬁlin molecules at the membrane . Furthermore , the release of this pool of PIP 2 - bound coﬁlin upon stimulation of the cell is proposed as the source of enhanced coﬁlin activity [ 33 ] . 32 3 . 2 . Model Development We assume PIP 2 to be in equilibrium under rest conditions of the cell , and that resting rates of production and decay are low [ 33 ] . Upon EGF stimulation , increased PLC activity catalyzes increased hydrolysis of PIP 2 at the membrane [ 24 , 33 ] . We represent this phe - nomenon by introducing a PLC - mediated hydrolysis rate d hyd , in eﬀect when PLC activity is elevated above rest levels . At this point , we consider only the eﬀect of PLC - mediated enhanced PIP 2 hydrolysis . We currently neglect other dynamics of the phosphoinositide pathway for simplicity . We propose the following equation of PIP 2 dynamics dP 2 dt = I P 2 − d P 2 P 2 (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) basal rates − (cid:18) d hyd PLC rest (cid:19) ( PLC − PLC rest ) P 2 (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) PLC − mediated hydrolysis . ( 3 . 5 ) At rest , Equation 3 . 5 leads to P 2 , rest = I P 2 d P 2 . Normalizing P 2 in Equation 3 . 5 by its resting steady state level , P 2 ( t ) = P 2 , rest · p 2 ( t ) , where p 2 ( t ) is dimensionless , obtains the scaled equation dp 2 dt = d P 2 ( 1 − p 2 − ˜ d hyd ( plc − 1 ) p 2 ) , ( 3 . 6 ) where ˜ d hyd = d hyd d P 2 . Similar to ˜ I stimPLC , the parameter ˜ d hyd is a dimensionless ratio of stimulated and resting rates , in this case ( PLC - mediated hydrolysis of PIP 2 ) / ( basal decay rates ) . The estimation of PIP 2 parameters ( Section 3 . 4 . 1 ) relies on the rough PIP 2 temporal data shown in Figure 1 . 2 ( from van Rheenen ( 2007 ) [ 33 ] ) . 3 . Dynamics of coﬁlin bound to PIP 2 at the membrane : Experimental work has ver - iﬁed that a population of coﬁlin molecules is bound to PIP 2 at the membrane of a resting cell [ 14 , 33 ] . We assume that coﬁlin binds to PIP 2 in a 1 : 1 binding ratio , and is thus released from the membrane upon EGF stimulation at the same rate as PIP 2 hydrolysis . 33 3 . 2 . Model Development We assume that membrane - bound coﬁlin , C 2 , is formed by dephosphorylation of inactive phospho - coﬁlin , C P . For now , we assume C 2 recovers at a constant dephosphorylation rate and binds to PIP 2 at the membrane with mass - action kinetics . The equation for membrane - bound coﬁlin is dC 2 dt = (cid:18) k P 2 P 2 , rest (cid:19) P 2 C P (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) phospho − cofilin binds PIP 2 − d C 2 C 2 (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) basal unbinding − (cid:18) d hyd PLC rest (cid:19) ( PLC − PLC rest ) C 2 (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) Loss via PIP 2 hydrolysis . ( 3 . 7 ) The ﬁrst term represents a simpliﬁed PIP 2 binding rate of phosphorylated coﬁlin that is stripped of its phosphate group . Here we approximate the re - binding of coﬁlin to the membrane , neglecting the distinct processes of coﬁlin dephosphorylation and PIP 2 binding . The recycling process rebuilds membrane - associated coﬁlin slowly as shown in the time proﬁles of phosphorylated coﬁlin in Fig 2 of Song ( 2006 ) [ 31 ] , and the PIP 2 recovery in Figure 1 . 2 of this theisis ( from van Rheenen ( 2007 ) [ 33 ] ) . Normalizing the coﬁlin variables by the average concentration of coﬁlin in the cell C i ( t ) = C tot · c i ( t ) , and substituting the normalized PLC and PIP 2 variables , plc and p 2 , the fraction of cellular coﬁlin that is bound to PIP 2 is described by dc 2 dt = k P 2 p 2 c p − d C 2 c 2 − d hyd ( plc − 1 ) c 2 . ( 3 . 8 ) 4 . Dynamics of active coﬁlin : We assume that the coﬁlin released from PIP 2 is in a free , unligated state . We consider this uninhibited state to be active , C A , as it is ready to bind actin ﬁlaments . We assume that active coﬁlin is released at the membrane from the PIP 2 - bound ( C 2 ) pool . Active coﬁlin can be phosphorylated ( to C P ) by LIM - Kinase , and consequently deactivated . We also assume active coﬁlin to be in equilibrium with actin ﬁlaments in a resting cell , with on and oﬀ rates proportional to concentrations in respec - tive pools . 34 3 . 2 . Model Development The resulting equation for active coﬁlin is dC A dt = d C 2 C 2 + k off C F − ( k on F ) C A (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) off − on actin filaments − k p C A (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) phosphorylation + (cid:18) d hyd PLC rest (cid:19) ( PLC − PLC rest ) C 2 , ( 3 . 9 ) where ( k on F ) , and k off are the ﬁlament binding and unbinding rate constants , k p is the rate constant of phosphorylation by LIMK , d C 2 is the decay of PIP 2 - bound coﬁlin , and d hyd is the rate constant of PLC - mediated PIP 2 hydrolysis described previously , all in units s − 1 . Scaling by the average concentration of cellular coﬁlin , so C A ( t ) = C tot · c a ( t ) , results in the equation for the active coﬁlin fraction , in dimensionless form dc a dt = d C 2 c 2 + k off c f − ( k on F ) c a − k p c a + d hyd ( plc − 1 ) c 2 . ( 3 . 10 ) 5 . Dynamics of ﬁlament - bound coﬁlin : Coﬁlin that is bound to F - actin makes up the pool C F . We assume that severing of ﬁlaments occurs in a resting cell at a basal rate proportional to the rest concentration of ﬁlament - bound coﬁlin , with rate constant k sev . We assume loss of ﬁlament - bound coﬁlin is proportional to the concentration of bound coﬁlin . We use a nonlinear unsaturated severing rate function F sev ( C F ) , as described in Section 2 . 5 F sev ( C F ) = k sev C F , rest (cid:18) C F C F , rest (cid:19) n , where n = 7 , and k sev < < 1 s − 1 so that barbed end production by coﬁlin severing is low at rest conditions . We assume that following a severing event , the bound coﬁlin molecules are released from the ﬁlament in an actin - monomer - bound inactive form which must be recycled before rebinding to ﬁlaments . 35 3 . 2 . Model Development The dynamics of the ﬁlament - bound coﬁlin compartment are described , at this stage by dC F dt = ( k on F ) C A − k off C F − k sev C F , rest (cid:18) C F C F , rest (cid:19) n (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) nonlinear filament severing . ( 3 . 11 ) Under these assumptions , the term k sev C F , rest is the only source of inactive monomer - bound coﬁlin . The model expansion outlined in Chapter 4 investigates the possibility of active coﬁlin binding to G - actin monomers in the cytosol as another potential source of monomer - bound coﬁlin . Normalizing C F in Equation 3 . 11 by the average coﬁlin concentration in the cell , so C F ( t ) = C tot · c f ( t ) , leads to dc f dt = ( k on F ) c a − k off c f − k sev φ F (cid:18) c f φ F (cid:19) n , ( 3 . 12 ) where φ F = C F , rest C tot = c f , rest . 6 . Dynamics of G - actin monomer - bound coﬁlin : After an actin ﬁlament severing event , coﬁlin is left bound to an actin monomer , termed C M , as described in van Rheenen ( 2007 ) [ 33 ] . Coﬁlin in this form is inactive , unable to bind and sever actin again until it is re - cycled to the membrane . This requires an actin monomer - stripping and phosphorylation - dephosphorylation process . We use the approximation that monomer - bound coﬁlin tran - sitions into the phosphorylated pool at a rate proportional to C M concentration , with a rate constant equal to the phosphorylation rate of active coﬁlin , k p . The proposed equation is dC M dt = k sev C F , rest (cid:18) C F C F , rest (cid:19) n (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) source − k p C M (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) phosphorylation , ( 3 . 13 ) with normalized form dc m dt = k sev φ F (cid:18) c f φ F (cid:19) n − k p c m . ( 3 . 14 ) 36 3 . 2 . Model Development Here we neglect the monomer - stripping step of the recovery process for simplicity . Thus , we work under the assumption that the monomer is stripped and coﬁlin is phosphorylated in one step , whereby phosphorylation is the rate - determining step of the process . We examine the implications of this assumption in Chapter 4 . 7 . Dynamics of phosphorylated coﬁlin : Coﬁlin is inactivated in the cytosol by phospho - rylation via LIM - Kinase . Coﬁlin in this C P pool is inhibited from binding both PIP 2 , and actin ﬁlaments . Phosphorylation of two diﬀerent coﬁlin pools , active coﬁlin ( C A ) and monomer - bound coﬁlin ( C M ) are considered , assuming with the same rate k p . Phosphory - lated coﬁlin rebinds PIP 2 at the membrane via a dephosphorylation process which requires a stripping proteinase SSH or CIN [ 31 , 32 ] . We assume here a ( slow ) dephosphorylation rate proportional to concentration of phospho - coﬁlin and mass action binding kinetics pro - portional to concentrations of phosphorylated coﬁlin and PIP 2 . The proposed equation governing dynamics of the phosphorylated coﬁlin pool is dC P dt = k p C A + k p C M − (cid:18) k P 2 P 2 , rest (cid:19) P 2 C P , ( 3 . 15 ) with scaled form dc p dt = k p ( c a + c m ) − k P 2 p 2 c p . ( 3 . 16 ) 8 . Dynamics of Barbed Ends : Following the reduced model outlined in Chapter 2 and Section 2 . 5 , we propose a barbed end equation where barbed end production in a stimu - lated cell is dependent on ﬁlament - bound coﬁlin C F . Barbed end dynamics are governed by the equation dB dt = P B − k cap B (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) basal source − sink + αk sev C F , rest (cid:18) C F C F , rest (cid:19) n (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) cofilin − induced rate , ( 3 . 17 ) where the rates P B and k sev C F , rest represent barbed end production in a resting cell , k cap is the capping rate constant , n is the nonlinear severing factor and α is the estimated con - version factor between coﬁlin used and barbed ends created , and converts between units of coﬁlin concentration ( µM ) and barbed end density ( number per µ m 3 ) . 37 3 . 2 . Model Development Here we apply an assumption that the basal severing rate by ﬁlament - bound coﬁlin is neg - ligible with respect to the production rate P B , so that αk sev C F , rest < < P B . Consequently , the resting barbed end concentration B rest = P B + αk sev C F , rest k cap , is approximated by B rest ≈ P B k cap . We normalize the barbed end density by the approximate rest steady state and scale coﬁlin concentration by the average coﬁlin concentration in the cell to obtain db dt = Ak sev φ F (cid:18) c f φ F (cid:19) n − k cap ( b − 1 ) , ( 3 . 18 ) where φ F = c f , rest , and the conversion parameter α is combined with scaling factors in the parameter A = α C tot B rest , as in Chapter 2 . The approximation step described here must be veriﬁed with coﬁlin parameters and information from the literature , that is , whether the ﬁlament - severing rate is much lower than other basal rates of barbed end production , αk sev C F , rest < P B . The model simulation results using a non - approximated barbed end equation are outlined in Chapter 4 . 38 3 . 3 . Full Normalized Model 3 . 3 Full Normalized Model The assumptions and simpliﬁcations described in Section 3 . 2 allow us to propose a simple model framework for a closed , temporal model of the coﬁlin activity cycle . The collected equations for the full model are displayed in the Appendix . The equations of the scaled model are : dplc dt = d PLC ( ˜ I stimPLC ( t ) + 1 − plc ) , ( 3 . 19 ) dp 2 dt = d P 2 ( 1 − p 2 − ˜ d hyd ( plc − 1 ) p 2 ) , ( 3 . 20 ) dc 2 dt = k P 2 p 2 c p − d C 2 c 2 − d hyd ( plc − 1 ) c 2 , ( 3 . 21 ) dc a dt = d C 2 c 2 + k off c f − ( k on F ) c a − k p c a + d hyd ( plc − 1 ) c 2 , ( 3 . 22 ) dc f dt = ( k on F ) c a − k off c f − k sev φ F (cid:18) c f φ F (cid:19) n , ( 3 . 23 ) dc m dt = k sev φ F (cid:18) c f φ F (cid:19) n − k p c m , ( 3 . 24 ) dc p dt = k p c a + k p c m − k P 2 p 2 c p , ( 3 . 25 ) db dt = k cap ( 1 − b ) + Ak sev φ F (cid:18) c f φ F (cid:19) n . ( 3 . 26 ) The dynamics of PLC and PIP 2 , Equations 3 . 19 and 3 . 20 are decoupled from the rest of the system . The coﬁlin equations , 3 . 21 - 3 . 25 represent the closed coﬁlin activity cycle and are strongly coupled by interconversion terms . The solution of the barbed end equation , 3 . 26 is a system readout which is dependent on the proﬁle of ﬁlament bound coﬁlin , c f ( t ) , the solution of Equation 3 . 23 ( recall that φ F = c f , rest ) . In the absence of a stimulus , the system has a basal steady state where PLC and PIP 2 are at their respective basal levels plc = 1 and p 2 = 1 . Similarly , barbed end density is at its resting steady state , b = 1 . The equations of coﬁlin concentrations , 3 . 21 - 3 . 25 , are expressed as fractions of the average concentration of the cell , the respective steady state are given in Table 3 . 1 . If a stimulus is introduced , such that ˜ I stimPLC ( t ) = ˜ I stim > 0 , a stimulated steady state exists where PLC activity is enhanced above resting levels , plc > 1 . The elevated activity of 39 3 . 4 . Model Parameter Analysis PLC induces a transient response in the coﬁlin cycle , which is known experimentally to increase ﬁlament - severing , and create a burst of barbed end density . To quantify this transient response with the above model , we require parameter estimates obtained from the experimental literature . 3 . 4 Model Parameter Analysis The equations of the model represent a downstream cascade of eﬀects initialized by PLC and PIP 2 dynamics at the cell membrane . The coﬁlin cycle returns to resting steady state on a slow time scale following EGF stimulation . This simpliﬁes model analysis , as dynamics of PLC activity and PIP 2 can be ﬁt to data independently of coﬁlin considerations . Coﬁlin transition rates can be examined based on PLC and PIP 2 results , model assumptions and available data about respective coﬁlin fractions . 3 . 4 . 1 PLC and PIP 2 Parameters We ﬁrst study the most upstream entity , PLC activity . In the right panel Figure 3 . 2 , we repro - duce the PLC activity proﬁle subject to EGF stimulation shown in the left panel of the same ﬁgure ( from Mouneimne et al ( 2004 ) [ 24 ] ) . The model equation 3 . 4 can produce a good representation of experimental results , as shown in Figure 3 . 2 . To obtain accurate time scale and relative proportions of stimulated and basal levels , we assign parameter values d PLC = 0 . 018 s − 1 and use scaled stimulation rates in the range ˜ I stim = 1 . 3 - 1 . 6 , such that during stimulation , the scaled stimulated production of PLC activity is I stimPLC ( t ) = 1 . 3 - 1 . 6 . In view of the reasonable agreement , we use the values d PLC = 0 . 018 s − 1 , ˜ I stim = 1 . 5 . The simple combined model consisting of Equations 3 . 19 and 3 . 20 facilitates the analysis of the decay rate of PIP 2 , d P 2 , and the nondimensional PLC - mediated PIP 2 hydrolysis rate , ˜ d hyd . In combination , these determine the PIP 2 reduction due to hydrolysis as well as the recovery time back to basal levels . From van Rheenen et al ( 2007 ) , PIP 2 decreases to a minimum of 40 - 60 % of its basal level 40 3 . 4 . Model Parameter Analysis upon EGF stimulation [ 33 ] . Figure 1 A in that paper , shown here in the left panel of Figure 3 . 3 , shows PIP 2 levels recover half of the lost concentration on a time scale of approximately 360 s . This suggests a decay rate d P 2 ≈ ln ( 2 ) / ( 360 ) ≈ 0 . 0018 s − 1 . Comparison between the simulations in the right panel of Figure 3 . 3 with the PIP 2 data in Figure 1 . 2 , suggests a reasonable value of ˜ d hyd in the range of 10 - 20 . This means that the PLC - dependent hydrolysis of PIP 2 is 10 - 20 times greater than resting background decay rate of PIP 2 due to other processes . For model simulations , we adopt the parameter settings d P 2 = 0 . 0018 s − 1 , ˜ d hyd = 20 . 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 0 . 8 1 1 . 2 1 . 4 1 . 6 1 . 8 2 2 . 2 time P L C Figure 3 . 2 : Left : Dynamics of PLC from Figure 2 A of Mouneimne ( 2004 ) [ 24 ] .

The parameter d P 2 = 0 . 018 s − 1 was chosen to give our estimated best ﬁt of PIP 2 recovery . We can compare these curves to the experimental data by van Rheenen’s Figure 1A to select parameters for our ( rough ) approximation of PIP 2 dynamics 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 time P I P 2 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 time P I P 2 Figure 3 . 4 : Model simulations of PIP 2 dynamics with d P 2 = 0 . 018 s − 1 , and Left : ˜ d hyd = 20 so that PIP 2 is almost completely reduced in the periphery , as per discussions with J .

Model Parameter Analysis 3 . 4 . 2 Coﬁlin Data Review We can use the resting state concentrations , together with data from the literature to satisfy the at rest steady state equations and solve for unknown model parameter values . In this section , I ﬁrst outline available time series information , then compare with the parameter constraints imposed by the model . We interpret Figure 6 A of van Rheenen ( 2007 ) as an exponential ﬁt of coﬁlin residence time , or decay , bound to either PIP 2 ( recovery t c 2 = 3 . 7 s ) or actin ﬁlaments ( recovery t cf = 26 s ) [ 33 ] . We recognize that under a linear model , these recovery times represent the half - life of the respective coﬁlin binding , such that the decay rate of C 2 is given by d c 2 = ln ( 2 ) t c 2 ≈ 0 . 19 s − 1 . ( 3 . 27 ) We can estimate the loss of ﬁlament - bound coﬁlin , which under our model occurs by the sum of rates k off and k sev , both linear at rest d cf = k off + k sev = ln ( 2 ) t cf ≈ 0 . 027 s − 1 . ( 3 . 28 ) We expect severing events to be rare in a resting cell , as barbed end production is tightly regulated and severing occurs primarily as stochastic ﬂuctuations of the system . This implies that the oﬀ - rate , k off , of coﬁlin being released from actin ﬁlaments without causing a severing event should be signiﬁcantly higher that the severing parameter k sev . This information is con - sistent with our assumption k off > k sev together with in vitro ﬁlament severing rates given in the literature [ 1 , 2 ] where k sev ≈ 0 . 010 - 0 . 012 s − 1 . If we interpret Figure 6 B of van Rheenen ( 2007 ) as the ﬁt of a linear combination of the C 2 and C F exponential decay equations , then y = A 1 exp ( − d c 2 t ) + A 2 exp ( − d cf t ) . 43 3 . 4 . Model Parameter Analysis Using this method , the relative ratios of PIP 2 - bound coﬁlin and ﬁlament - bound coﬁlin can be obtained for both a resting and stimulated cell . We obtain the at rest ratio from this ﬁgure , implemented as initial conditions in our model , C 2 , rest C F , rest = 0 . 85 0 . 15 . This ratio decreases upon stimulation with EGF to C 2 , stim C F , stim = 0 . 38 0 . 62 , which is important for time proﬁle ﬁtting of our model simulations . Furthermore , Figure 2 in van Rheenen ( 2007 ) shows an observed 2 - fold increase of ﬁlament - bound coﬁlin C F upon stim - ulation with EGF . Figure 2 of Song et al . ( 2006 ) [ 31 ] , exhibits the time proﬁle of phosphorylated coﬁlin before and after stimulation of the cell with EGF . The resting level is identiﬁed as C P , rest = 0 . 18 ( ± 4 ) · C tot , and stimulated level , which we take to be the maximum of the phosphorylated coﬁlin pool is C P , max = 0 . 38 ( ± 6 ) · C tot . Further time proﬁles of phospho - coﬁlin can be used to ﬁt model simulations [ 31 ] , but this is beyond the scope of this thesis . We use compare the experimental data of a stimulated cell to model simulations , shown in Section 4 . 8 , and discuss conclusions in Chapter 5 . 3 . 4 . 3 Coﬁlin Model Parameter Analysis Here we outline the analysis of model assumptions and equations to combine with available coﬁlin data from Section 3 . 4 . 2 to gain information about unknown model parameters . The information given in Song et . al ( 2006 ) , [ 31 ] , implies the rest fraction of phosphorylated coﬁlin in the cell to be c p , rest = 0 . 20 . Through analysis of Figure 6 of van Rheenen ( 2007 ) [ 33 ] , the ratio of coﬁlin bound to F - actin 44 3 . 4 . Model Parameter Analysis and PIP 2 at the periphery of the cell is identiﬁed as c f , rest c 2 , rest ≈ 0 . 15 0 . 85 , which gives c 2 , rest ≈ 5 . 8 · c f , rest . From personal communication with J . Condeelis , we estimate the fraction of PIP 2 - bound coﬁlin at rest as c 2 , rest ≈ 0 . 10 . This supports resting level fractions of ﬁlament - bound , and PIP 2 - bound coﬁlin to be approximately c f , rest = 0 . 02 , c 2 , rest = 0 . 10 . The conservation assumption Equation 3 . 2 also implies that , at rest , the normalized coﬁlin pools sum up to 1 c 2 , rest + c a , rest + c f , rest + c m , rest + c p , rest = 1 . ( 3 . 29 ) Thus the sum of at rest steady state fractions of active and monomer - bound coﬁlin is approxi - mately c a , rest + c m , rest = 1 − c 2 , rest − c f , rest − c p , rest = 1 − 0 . 10 − 0 . 02 − 0 . 20 = 0 . 68 . ( 3 . 30 ) We ﬁrst identify steady state relationships between resting coﬁlin pool levels . We set deriva - tives of Equations 3 . 21 - 3 . 25 to zero , and use the assumption k sev < < 1 s − 1 . From equation 3 . 21 , parameters must satisfy the relationship c 2 , rest = k P 2 · p 2 , rest d C 2 · c p , rest , ( 3 . 31 ) where c i , rest is the scaled coﬁlin level and p 2 , rest = 1 is scaled PIP 2 level in the resting cell . Equation 3 . 31 , together with the rest levels data of PIP 2 - bound and phosphorylated coﬁlin , 45 3 . 4 . Model Parameter Analysis provides a relationship between the dephosphorylation rate of the model k P 2 and the decay rate of PIP 2 coﬁlin d C 2 . We have k P 2 = c 2 , rest p 2 , rest · c p , rest · d C 2 = 0 . 10 1 · 0 . 20 · d C 2 , so that k P 2 = 0 . 5 · d C 2 . Since PIP 2 - bound coﬁlin decays as PIP 2 decays at the membrane , we assume d C 2 = d P 2 . The PIP 2 decay rate constant , d P 2 approximated in Section 3 . 4 . 1 . We then set parameter values d C 2 = 0 . 002 s − 1 , k P 2 = 0 . 001 s − 1 . Furthermore , from equation 3 . 25 c p , rest = k p k P 2 · ( c a , rest + c m , rest ) . ( 3 . 32 ) From above , the rest fraction of phospho - coﬁlin is c p , rest = 0 . 20 , and from Equation 3 . 30 c a , rest + c m , rest = 0 . 68 . This gives the relation 0 . 68 0 . 20 = k P 2 k p , and k P 2 = 3 . 40 · k p . The phosphorylation rate can be approximated as k p = 2 . 94 · 10 − 4 s − 1 . The steady state equation of monomer - bound coﬁlin , Equation 3 . 24 can be simpliﬁed , since 46 3 . 4 . Model Parameter Analysis φ F = C F , rest / C tot = c f , rest . This identiﬁes the relationship c m , rest = k sev k p · c f , rest . ( 3 . 33 ) Notice that the ratio between monomer - bound and ﬁlament - bound coﬁlin at resting conditions is determined here by the ratio between basal severing and phosphorylation rates . This implies c m , rest c f , rest = k sev k p . ( 3 . 34 ) We identify this parameter k sev , ( for which there are estimates only from in vitro work and other modeling eﬀorts [ 1 , 6 ] ) , as a free parameter to be tested by model simulations . It is identiﬁed by the constraints of Equation 3 . 34 once the rest steady state level of monomer - bound coﬁlin , c m , rest is assigned . From discussion with J . Condeelis , we work under the assumption that the fraction of active coﬁlin is very small at any time t . Condeelis predicts this coﬁlin fraction to be near zero in a resting cell , therefore , we estimate the rest level of active coﬁlin pool of coﬁlin as c a , rest ≈ 0 . 01 . By conservation , Equation 3 . 30 , this gives c m , rest = 0 . 67 . This identiﬁes the severing model parameter , since to satisfy Equation 3 . 34 , we have k sev = 0 . 67 0 . 02 · k p , so k sev = 0 . 0099 s − 1 . In line with the conservation equation 3 . 30 , c m , rest = 0 . 67 , c a , rest = 0 . 01 . The coﬁlin equations 3 . 22 and 3 . 23 introduce two actin - binding parameters , k off and simpli - ﬁed binding rate constant ( k on F ) . From Equation 3 . 28 , and the linear decay of ﬁlament - bound 47 3 . 4 . Model Parameter Analysis coﬁlin from Equation 3 . 23 , we obtain the relationship between rate constants of loss of ﬁlament - bound coﬁlin k off = d cf − k sev = 0 . 027 s − 1 − 0 . 0099 s − 1 , ( 3 . 35 ) = 0 . 0171 s − 1 ( 3 . 36 ) based on previous assumptions . Thus the model assumptions satisfy experimental predictions that k off > k sev . We can gain further information about parameters by using the relationship between steady states of Equations 3 . 10 and 3 . 12 c a , rest = 1 k p + ( k on F ) · [ d C 2 c 2 , rest + k off c f , rest ] , ( 3 . 37 ) and c f , rest ≈ k on F k off + k sev · c a , rest . ( 3 . 38 ) Setting the relations for c a , rest equal to one another and simplifying obtains the relation k p k sev + k p k off + ( k on F ) k sev ( k on F ) d C 2 = c 2 , rest c f , rest , which can be further simpliﬁed to be in terms previously identiﬁed parameter ratios d C 2 k p · c 2 , rest c f , rest − c m , rest c f , rest = k sev + k off ( k on F ) . ( 3 . 39 ) From Equation 3 . 38 , together with previous assumptions about resting concentrations and resulting parameter estimates , we ﬁnd that the ﬁlament association and dissociation parameters must satisfy 6 . 80 · 5 . 0 − 33 . 50 = k sev + k off ( k on F ) = c a , rest c f , rest . Here we have deﬁned c a , rest = 0 . 01 , so ( k on F ) = 2 · ( k sev + k off ) . 48 3 . 5 . Summary of Model Equations and Parameters Using experimental data from van Rheenen ( 2007 ) ( Section 3 . 4 . 2 ) , the ﬁlament binding rate is estimated as ( k on F ) = 2 · ln ( 2 ) 26 s − 1 = 0 . 054 s − 1 . 3 . 5 Summary of Model Equations and Parameters We simulate the system of ODEs , Equations 3 . 19 - 3 . 26 using parameter values described in Sec - tion 3 . 4 . 3 and summarized in Table 3 . 2 and 3 . 3 . The system is initialized at the respective rest steady states . The stimulus is introduced as an EGF step function turned on at t = 60 s and oﬀ at t = 120 s , such that ˜ I stimPLC ( t ) = ˜ I stim ( Heaviside ( t − 60 ) − Heaviside ( t − 120 ) ) .

Simulations of Well - Mixed Model 3 . 6 Simulations of Well - Mixed Model The following ﬁgures exhibit an example of simulation results of the well - mixed temporal coﬁlin system for proposed model assumptions and parameter estimates . We simulate two scenarios proposed by experiments . First , we use a PLC - hydrolysis parameter of d hyd = 0 . 01 s − 1 to pro - duce a 60 % reduction of PIP 2 levels , shown in the left panel of Figure 3 . 5 . This represents the overall reduction of PIP 2 as given in van Rheenen ( 2007 ) . The model simulations results are shown in Figures 3 . 6 - 3 . 8 . Secondly , model simulation with d hyd = 0 . 04 s − 1 produces almost complete reduction of PIP 2 , shown in the right panel of Figure 3 . 5 . Motivated by discussions with J . Condeelis , this represents cellular activity in local regions near an EGF receptor . The results of model simulations are given in Figures 3 . 9 - 3 . 11 . The simulations of a 60 % reduction in PIP 2 levels result in a similar reduction in the level of PIP 2 - bound coﬁlin . The resulting barbed end density reaches a maximum increase of less than 5 - fold over resting barbed end levels ( Figure 3 . 8 ) . This peak is enhanced by increasing the PIP 2 reduction , since this induces a much larger release of PIP 2 - bound coﬁlin ( Figure 3 . 10 ) . This generates a barbed end peak of approximately 8 - 9 fold increase over resting levels ( Figure 3 . 11 ) . While these results reproduce the experimental increase in barbed ends , up to 10 - 12 fold , at a respectable level , both scenarios fail to generate the 2 - fold increase in ﬁlament - bound coﬁlin shown in van Rheenen ( 2007 ) . In the next chapter , I outline our work to reformulate the well - mixed cell approximation . By working within a model framework which better represents the physical properties of a cell , we aim to analyze the assumptions made in this chapter and verify model results . 50 3 . 6 .

We introduce two volume compartments , one to represent the small region at the cell edge and another to represent the large cellular interior . Compartmental considerations are supported by the desire to diﬀerentiate the coﬁlin forms identiﬁed to be bound at the cell edge by ﬂuorescence - tagged membrane experiments versus those that diﬀuse freely in the cytosol [ 24 , 33 ] . Coﬁlin bound to PIP 2 ( C 2 ) has been shown to be stationary and membrane - associated [ 33 ] . Coﬁlin binding to F - actin is known experimentally to be conﬁned to the periphery of the cell by inhibition of tropomyosin binding to ﬁlaments in the interior [ 12 , 33 ] . These model revisions quantify relative local concentrations of coﬁlin in the periphery and cytosolic compartments by identifying the diﬀerent volumes of the edge and interior com - partments , which may be up to 1 or 2 orders of magnitude larger . This requires revision of the model equations to represent transition between compartments . We also consider whether interactions previously neglected could be signiﬁcant , so we include the reactivation of coﬁlin via direct dephosphorylation of C P , re - binding of active coﬁlin C A back onto PIP 2 at the membrane ( into C 2 pool ) , and a new equilibrium relationship between active and monomer - bound coﬁlin . The revised deﬁnitions of coﬁlin pools in respective compartments are outlined in Table 4 . 1 and interactions between coﬁlin forms shown in the schematic , Figure 4 . 1 . 55 4 . 1 . Introduction This model version serves as the ﬁnal step in the analysis of the temporal dynamics of the coﬁlin pathway before embarking on a spatio - temporal model . Here , we address all possible interactions between the identiﬁed coﬁlin forms with the goal of identifying the critical interac - tions to include in the spatial framework . A future one - dimensional ( PDE ) model should then simulate the distribution of coﬁlin as distance from the cell edge . Thus , the edge and inte - rior compartments examined in this chapter will determine the boundary conditions of a radial model . This ﬁnal temporal model also facilitates the veriﬁcation of appropriate and necessary model assumptions to simplify future work .

Introduction PIP2 EGF PLC C2 membrane edge interior IP3 CF CM CP CP CM CA CA Figure 4 . 1 : Schematic of proposed temporal compartmental model of coﬁlin pathway : Dynamics are separated into those at the edge of the cell , and interactions in the cytosol , or interior of the cell . At the membrane , EGF stimulation activates PLC , causing the membrane lipid PIP 2 to be hydrolyzed . This releases the coﬁlin from the membranous PIP 2 - bound pool ( C E 2 ) to an active form ( pool C EA ) at the edge of the cell , from which it can attach to actin ﬁlaments ( pool C EF ) , or bind to G - actin ( C EM ) , phosporylated ( to C EP ) , or rebind to PIP 2 . Once the ﬁlament is severed , coﬁlin comes oﬀ , carrying an actin monomer ( pool C EM ) with it . Filament dynamics are assumed to occur near the membrane , in the edge compartment . Following a severing event , the G - actin - coﬁlin is stripped of its monomer , and phosphorylated by LIM kinase into the form C P , so that it could reattach to PIP 2 . The freely diﬀusing forms of coﬁlin diﬀuse between the edge and interior compartment , to C IA , C IM , C IP . 57 4 . 1 . Introduction 4 . 1 . 1 General Assumptions • We will consider here only temporal dynamics , and thereby approximate the cell as a well - mixed system where coﬁlin molecules move freely between the cytosolic and peripheral compartments of the cell . • Cellular coﬁlin is divided into several forms in the edge compartment ( within 200 n m of the cell membrane ) and in the interior compartment . Freely diﬀusing forms can transition between the two compartments , whereas coﬁlin molecules bound to PIP 2 at the membrane , or bound to ﬁlaments at the edge of the cell are conﬁned to the edge compartment . We assume that the edge and interior compartments have ﬁxed volumes , V E and V I respectively . • The total amount of coﬁlin is conserved in the cell . We use the notation C Ei and C Ii to denote concentrations in micromolar units ( µM ) of coﬁlin in various forms . The total number of molecules of coﬁlin is given by the conservation statement V E · ( C E 2 + C EA + C EF + C EM + C EP ) + V I · ( C IA + C IM + C IP ) = V tot · C tot = ( V E + V I ) · C tot , ( 4 . 1 ) where V E , V I are volumes of compartments , usually in µ m 3 , C tot is the total average coﬁlin concentration in the cell ( 10 µM ) , and the coﬁlin forms , C i , are as deﬁned in Table 4 . 1 . • Actin ﬁlament density is constant and abundant within the domain . We consider an actin binding rate dependent only on available coﬁlin , and assume ﬁlament severing to be independent of ﬁlament density for now . • Barbed end dynamics are governed by equations proposed in earlier works and do not feed back on their own production . We assume that active barbed ends observed at 60s following stimulation with EGF are due to ampliﬁcation of coﬁlin severing . 58 4 . 2 . Model Details 4 . 2 Model Details Motivated by experimental conclusions , we deﬁne the edge compartment as the region within 200 n m of the cell membrane , and the interior compartment as the remaining fraction of the cell [ 33 ] . This implies a large diﬀerence in compartmental volumes , V I > > V E , conﬁrmed by calculations outlined in the Appendix . Since some coﬁlin forms , C 2 and C F exist only at the edge of the cell , whereas the other coﬁlin forms , C A , C M , and C P are present at both the edge , and in the interior of the cell , we must consider the eﬀective local densities of each coﬁlin fraction in the given compartment . We will denote relative local coﬁlin concentrations of respective forms as C Ei in the edge compartment , and C Ii in the interior . For example , monomer - bound coﬁlin concentration in the edge compartment is described by C Ei = molar quantity of monomer - bound coﬁlin in edge volume of edge compartment . We ensure that balance equations are written in terms of conservation of mass or of num - bers of molecules . When compartment volumes diﬀer , as in the case we describe here , this introduces some correction factors from dilution eﬀects . To avoid confusion about relative local concentrations , we outline several diﬀerent notations here . These all convey the same message , conservation of total coﬁlin , Equation 4 . 1 . The quantity V tot · C tot has units µ m 3 · µM since these are common units of measure . . Converting this quantity into number of molecules of coﬁlin requires a conversion factor η , described in the Appendix . The total number of coﬁlin molecules in the cell is given by # molecules = V tot · C tot · η , where η = 600 molecules µM − 1 µ m − 3 , since 1 µ M ≈ 600 molecules per µ m 3 , details of this calculation are outlined in the Appendix . The available data that describes the resting coﬁlin concentrations in a cell is given as the proportion of total coﬁlin in the cell . We take these to be proportions of the total molecular content ( as in ﬂuorescence data ) . We use the average total cellular coﬁlin concentration of 10 µM [ 26 ] . This allows us to calculate the total molecular content in our model cell approximation , 59 4 . 2 . Model Details after choosing a volume estimate . We can nondimensionalize Equation 4 . 1 by dividing by V tot · C tot , obtaining the relationship V E V tot (cid:18) C E 2 C tot + C EA C tot + C EF C tot + C EM C tot + C EP C tot (cid:19) + V I V tot (cid:18) C IA C tot + C IM C tot + C IP C tot (cid:19) = 1 . We deﬁne compartment volumes by total volume of the cell , and relative coﬁlin concentrations scaled by average coﬁlin concentration C tot , deﬁning v E = V E V tot , v I = V I V tot , c i = C i C tot , This leads to the the nondimensional conservation equation v E · ( c E 2 + c Ea + c Ef + c Em + c Ep ) + v I · ( c Ia + c Im + c Ip ) = 1 . ( 4 . 2 ) Finally , if we combine relative local concentrations with their respective volume fraction , such that ˜ c Ei = v E · c Ei , ˜ c Ii = v I · c Ii , the conservation equation can be expressed as ( ˜ c E 2 + ˜ c Ea + ˜ c Ef + ˜ c Em + ˜ c Ep ) + ( ˜ c Ia + ˜ c Im + ˜ c Ip ) = 1 . Notice that the ˜ c i expression represents the fraction of total molecular coﬁlin in each respective form . These modiﬁcations in methodology and model development introduce several new aspects to the model . First , available data gives estimates of resting coﬁlin fractions of respective forms [ 24 , 31 , 33 ] . We take these to be proportional to the average coﬁlin concentration in the cell . The fractions which exist in strictly the edge compartment must be scaled to obtain the relative local concentrations of each coﬁlin form . For example , if C i , in units of µM , is the average cellular concentration of coﬁlin in form i , we can convert this to the relative local concentration in the edge compartment using the relationship 60 4 . 2 . Model Details C Ei = V tot V E · C i . Based on the exchange between compartments , we must now incorporate 3 additional ODEs in the system to describe the dynamics of C IA , C IM and C IP in the interior . The rate of change of each respective coﬁlin form in each compartment is described qualitatively by d dt [ molecules of form i in compartment ] = rate of exchange + source terms − loss terms . Currently , we assume that exchange between compartments follows simple diﬀusion . Transi - tions between compartments of each respective coﬁlin form occur at a rate proportional to the concentration diﬀerence . We utilize known coﬁlin diﬀusion coeﬃcient ( D ≈ 10 µ m 2 s − 1 ) [ 26 ] to give the rate of molecular exchange and use a width parameter of the cell ( ω = 0 . 2 µ m ) [ 21 ] . These parameters scale the compartmental transition terms and match units in Equations 4 . 3 and 4 . 4 The rate of change of coﬁlin in given forms satisﬁes d ( V E C Ei ) dt = ωD [ C Ii − C Ei ] + source terms − loss terms , ( 4 . 3 ) d ( V I C Ii ) dt = − ωD [ C Ii − C Ei ] + source terms − loss terms . ( 4 . 4 ) The considerations of compartmental volumes and transitions aﬀect only the diﬀusing forms that exchange between the edge and interior , not C 2 or C F . We assume a constant diﬀusion co - eﬃcient for all forms of coﬁlin , though the coeﬃcient describing diﬀusion of C M may be slightly lower due to the larger structural size of the complex . We also take into account several interactions neglected in previous modelling eﬀorts . These include equilibrium binding of G - actin on / oﬀ active coﬁlin ( C A ↔ C M ) , rebinding of active coﬁlin to PIP 2 at the membrane , and dephosphorylation of phospho - coﬁlin at locations other than the membrane . These interactions are included in the full model schematic shown in Figure 4 . 1 . The addition of these interactions in the absence of further experimental data will require extensive simplifying model assumptions . However , we hope that the process will facilitate some insight into the importance of each respective interaction eﬀect . 61 4 . 3 . Model Equations 4 . 3 Model Equations For the most part , equations will closely follow their forms in Equations 3 . 19 - 3 . 26 . However , in this version , we expand the model to incorporate a more complete collection of potential cellular interactions . We keep the same assumptions and equations for PLC and PIP 2 , since these system com - ponents are not involved in the conservation equation . We proceed with the scaled equations as experimental data is commonly given in a normalized form as fold increases over resting levels . I outline here the revised model equations for PIP 2 - bound coﬁlin , C E 2 , and both edge and interior forms of active coﬁlin , C EA and C IA , where new terms are expressed in red font . The Equations 3 . 23 - 3 . 25 are revised in a similar manner to include new terms from Figure 4 . 1 and exchange between compartments . 1 . Dynamics of coﬁlin bound to PIP 2 at the membrane : Since PIP 2 is a membrane - associated lipid , coﬁlin bound to PIP 2 is assumed to exist only in the membrane compart - ment . We quantify the coﬁlin bound to the membrane at any time t , as # moles C E 2 = V E · C E 2 . The equation for membrane - bound coﬁlin dynamics is given by d ( V E C E 2 ) dt = (cid:18) k Pp 2 P 2 , rest (cid:19) P 2 V E C EP (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) phospho − cofilin binds PIP 2 + (cid:18) k Ap 2 P 2 , rest (cid:19) P 2 V E C EA (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) active cofilin binds PIP 2 − d C 2 V E C E 2 (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) basal unbinding − (cid:18) d hyd PLC rest (cid:19) ( PLC − PLC rest ) V E C E 2 (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) Loss when PIP 2 hydrolyzed , ( 4 . 5 ) where terms are as previously with the addition of PIP 2 - binding rates from phosphorylated and active coﬁlin forms , k Pp 2 and k Ap 2 , respectively . We then normalize the molecular level of PIP 2 - bound coﬁlin by the total amount of coﬁlin in the cell to obtain fractions of total cellular coﬁlin , v E · c Ei = V E V tot · C Ei C tot . ( 4 . 6 ) Since fractioned edge compartment volume , v E = V E / V tot , is assumed to be approximately constant in time , and appears in all terms here , we can divide it from both sides of 62 4 . 3 . Model Equations Equation 4 . 5 . Using normalized PLC and PIP 2 variables , ( PLC ( t ) = PLC rest · plc ( t ) ) , the nondimensional concentration of PIP 2 - bound coﬁlin ( C 2 ( t ) = C tot · c 2 ) is dc E 2 dt = k Pp 2 p 2 c Ep + k Ap 2 p 2 c Ea − d C 2 c E 2 − d hyd ( plc − 1 ) c E 2 . ( 4 . 7 ) 2 . Dynamics of active coﬁlin at the periphery : Coﬁlin liberated from the membrane compartment is released into the edge compartment of the cell . We consider this coﬁlin form to be active ( pool C EA ) , as it can bind to available and uninhibited actin ﬁlaments . Active coﬁlin diﬀuses between the edge and interior compartments of the cell , at a rate proportional to its concentration diﬀerence . Here we assume G - actin monomers with re - spective on and oﬀ rates proportional to concentrations in respective pools . Expanding on assumptions of previous models , here we consider the reactivation of coﬁlin by dephospho - rylation ( from C P ) or loss of the actin monomer ( from C M ) . These considerations were motivated by conversations with J . Condeelis , and work shown in Mogilner , Keshet ( 2002 ) [ 21 ] respectively . The revised equation of active coﬁlin is dV E C EA dt = ωD (cid:2) C IA − C EA (cid:3) (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) diffusion + d C 2 V E C E 2 + k off V E C EF − ( k on F ) V E C EA − k p V E C EA + k dp V E C EP (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) dephosphorylation + k ma V E C EM − k am V E C EA (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) off − on − G − actin − monomer − (cid:18) k Ap 2 P 2 , rest (cid:19) P 2 V E C EA (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) active cofilin binds PIP 2 + (cid:18) d hyd PLC rest (cid:19) ( PLC − PLC rest ) V E C E 2 , ( 4 . 8 ) where d C 2 , k on F , and k off , k p , and d hyd are deﬁned as before ( in s − 1 ) . The constants ω ( µ m ) and D ( µ m 2 s − 1 ) are the cell width and diﬀusion parameters described previously , k am and k ma are G - actin - monomer binding and un - binding rates , and k dp is the rate of dephosphorylation via various cellular phosphatases ( s − 1 ) . We scale the equation for active coﬁlin dynamics as in Equation 4 . 6 to obtain the equation 63 4 . 3 . Model Equations for nondimensional active coﬁlin in the edge compartment dc Ea dt = ωD V E [ c Ia − c Ea ] + d C 2 c E 2 + k off c Ef − ( k on F ) c Ea − k p c Ea + k dp c Ep + k ma c Em − k am c Ea − k Ap 2 p 2 c Ea + d hyd ( plc − 1 ) c E 2 . ( 4 . 9 ) Note that the compartment volume consideration aﬀects the scaled equation only by a concentration , or ”dilution” eﬀect in the exchange term . 3 . Dynamics of active coﬁlin in the interior : The coﬁlin released into the edge com - partment can be contained there by to membrane or ﬁlament associated dynamics , but can also transition into the interior compartment of the cell . We consider the large interior compartment of the cell to be well - mixed , as characterized by fast diﬀusion rates in the cytosol of the cell . In the interior compartment , we assume coﬁlin cycles between diﬀerent forms based on equilibrium interactions between active , monomer - bound , and phospho - coﬁlin . We assume transition rate constants to be equivalent to transition rates proposed at the edge of the cell . Since the relative volumes of the interior to the edge compartments can diﬀer by up to two orders of magnitude , molecules that transition into the interior compartment are diﬀused due to the increase in relative volume . Thus , concentrations of interior pools will be relatively constant in the absence of a large release of coﬁlin molecules from on of the edge pools ( ie . such as the release of C 2 following EGF stimulation ) . The equation for active coﬁlin in the interior compartment is d ( V I C IA ) dt = − ωD (cid:2) C IA − C EA (cid:3) (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) source / loss due to diffusion − k p V I C IA + k dp V I C IP (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) phos − dephosphorylation + k ma V I C IM − k am V I C IA (cid:124) (cid:123)(cid:122) (cid:125) off − on − monomer , ( 4 . 10 ) where transition rates are as described previously . We scale Equation 4 . 10 , as in Equation 4 . 6 , to obtain the equation for nondimensional local concentration of active interior coﬁlin dc Ia dt = − ωD V I [ c Ia − c Ea ] − k p c Ia + k dp c Ip + k ma c Im − k am c Ia . ( 4 . 11 ) 64 4 . 3 . Model Equations 4 . Dynamics of Barbed Ends : We use the full ( non - approximated ) barbed end equation from Section 2 . 5 of Chapter 2 to a generate a more complete picture of barbed end dynamics . We work with the non - approximated barbed end steady state equation B rest = P B + αk sev C F , rest k cap , and normalize Equation 3 . 17 , similar to the method of Section 2 . 5 , such that B ( t ) = B rest · b ( t ) db dt = Ak sev [ (cid:18) c f φ F (cid:19) n − 1 ] − k cap [ b − 1 ] ( 4 . 12 ) where parameters A , k sev , and k cap are as described previously , and φ F is the scaled rest - ing steady state of ﬁlament - bound coﬁlin , φ F = c f , rest . The analysis of model parameters in described brieﬂy in Section 4 . 5 , alternatively readers can skip to the outline of parameters used in Tables 4 . 2 and 4 . 3 . 65 4 . 4 . Compartmental Model Summary 4 . 4 Compartmental Model Summary With these simpliﬁcations , we can rewrite the model equations in their reduced and normalized form dplc dt = d PLC ( ˜ I stimPLC ( t ) + 1 − plc ) , ( 4 . 13 ) dp 2 dt = d P 2 ( 1 − p 2 − ˜ d hyd ( plc − 1 ) p 2 ) , ( 4 . 14 ) dc E 2 dt = k Pp 2 p 2 c Ep + k Ap 2 p 2 c Ea − d C 2 c 2 − d hyd ( plc − 1 ) c 2 , ( 4 . 15 ) dc Ea dt = ωD V E [ c Ia − c Ea ] + d C 2 c 2 + k off c f − ( k on F ) c Ea − k p c Ea + k dp c Ep + k ma c Em − k am c Ea − k Ap 2 p 2 c Ea + d hyd ( plc − 1 ) c 2 , ( 4 . 16 ) dc Ef dt = ( k on F ) c a − k off c f − k sev φ F (cid:18) c f φ F (cid:19) n , ( 4 . 17 ) dc Em dt = ωD V E [ c Im − c Em ] + k sev φ F (cid:18) c f φ F (cid:19) n − k mp c Em + k pm c Ep − k ma c Em , + k am c Ea ( 4 . 18 ) dc Ep dt = ωD V E [ c Ip − c Ep ] + k p c Ea − k dp c Ep + k mp c Em − k pm c Ep − k Pp 2 p 2 c Ep , ( 4 . 19 ) dc Ia dt = − ωD V I [ c Ip − c Ep ] − k p c Ia + k dp c Ip + k ma c Im − k Iam c Ia , ( 4 . 20 ) dc Im dt = − ωD V I [ c Im − c Em ] − k mp c Im + k pm c Ip − k ma c Im + k am c Ia , ( 4 . 21 ) dc Ip dt = − ωD V I [ c Ip − c Ep ] + k p c Ia − k dp c Ip + k mp c Im − k pm c Ip , ( 4 . 22 ) db dt = k cap ( 1 − b ) + Ak sev φ F (cid:18) c f φ F (cid:19) n . ( 4 . 23 ) Notice that the reduced coﬁlin equations form a closed system when multiplied by the re - spective volume fractions of each compartment , such that v E · (cid:34) dc 2 dt + dc Ea dt + dc f dt + dc Em dt + dc Ep dt (cid:35) + v I · (cid:34) dc Ia dt + dc Im dt + dc Ip dt (cid:35) = 0 . 4 . 5 Model Parameter Analysis As outlined in Section 3 . 4 . 2 , we have information referring to the concentrations of various coﬁlin pools at rest . We ﬁrst make some assumptions necessary for model identiﬁcation . 66 4 . 5 . Model Parameter Analysis • We ﬁrst consider the assumption that the freely diﬀusing coﬁlin forms are at equal con - centrations in the edge and interior compartments at rest . This allows us to reduce the compartment exchange term from the steady state equations . 1 • We assume that transition rates between coﬁlin forms are equivalent in the respective com - partments . Eﬀectively , we assume that the cellular complexes required for each transition are equally abundant and active in the edge and the interior of the cell . This assumption may be accurate for some coﬁlin processes ( such as LIM kinase - mediated phosphoryla - tion ) and very inaccurate for others ( ie . monomer - binding ) . The transition rates will be considered independently in a later model reduction . 4 . 5 . 1 Steady State Analysis The steady state equations provide constraints on parameters . We set derivatives of Equations 4 . 15 - 4 . 22 to zero and examine rest state conditions . From Equation 4 . 15 c E 2 , rest = 1 d C 2 · [ k Pp 2 c Ep , rest + k Ap 2 c Ea , rest ] . ( 4 . 24 ) Under the assumption c Ea , rest < < 1 as described in Chapter 3 , this gives the approximate relationship k p 2 d C 2 ≈ c E 2 , rest c Ep , rest , indicating that the binding rate of phospho - coﬁlin to PIP 2 at the membrane must be signiﬁcantly higher than the C 2 decay rate in order to maintain the large local concentration of PIP 2 - bound coﬁlin . We assume here that free diﬀusing forms of coﬁlin have the same concentration in the edge and interior compartments . The steady state equations of these forms account only for the source and loss terms of the pool , so from Equation 4 . 16 , the resting level of active coﬁlin in the edge compartment is c Ea , rest = d C 2 c 2 , rest + k off c f , rest + k ma c Em , rest + k dp c Ep , rest k Ap 2 + k on F + k am + k p . ( 4 . 25 ) 1 The no net ﬂux simpliﬁcation will have to be reviewed in later models . It is possible that rest conditions could lead to opposed standing gradients at the cell edge such that the net ﬂux between compartments is zero . 67 4 . 5 . Model Parameter Analysis The steady state equation for ﬁlament - bound coﬁlin , from Equation 4 . 17 , is much simpler , since our model includes just one known source c Ef , rest = k on F k off + k sev · c Ea , rest , ( 4 . 26 ) which can be rearranged to obtain the relationship c Ef , rest c Ea , rest = k on F k off + k sev . This implies that binding parameters must exceed the loss rates by some magnitude to maintain the relatively high local concentration of ﬁlament - bound coﬁlin , ( c Ef , rest > > c Ea , rest ) in the edge compartment at rest . Based on Equation 4 . 18 , we ﬁnd c Em , rest = k sev c Ef , rest + k am c Ea , rest + k pm c Em , rest k mp + k ma , ( 4 . 27 ) where the severing term is expected to be low at rest . Equation 4 . 19 implies the concentration of phosphorylated coﬁlin in the edge compartment at rest satisﬁes c Ep , rest = k p c Ea , rest + k mp c Em , rest k dp + k pm + k p 2 . ( 4 . 28 ) The equations of coﬁlin forms in the interior compartment each have two source terms and two loss terms . Based on Equation 4 . 20 , the relative concentration of active coﬁlin in the interior is given by c Ia , rest = k dp c Ip , rest + k ma c Im , rest k p + k am . ( 4 . 29 ) Similarly , from Equation 4 . 21 , the interior monomer - bound coﬁlin at rest satisﬁes c Im , rest = k pm c Ip , rest + k am c Ia , rest k mp + k ma . ( 4 . 30 ) 68 4 . 5 . Model Parameter Analysis And ﬁnally , the concentration of phospho - coﬁlin in the interior , from Equation 4 . 22 , must satisfy c Ip , rest = k p c Ia , rest + k mp c Im , rest k dp + k pm . ( 4 . 31 ) 4 . 5 . 2 Model Parameter Estimation Under the assumption of equal concentrations in the edge and interior compartments , we can combine equations for respective forms of coﬁlin and reduce parameters . Equating the edge and interior concentrations of monomer - bound coﬁlin at rest , Equations 4 . 27 and 4 . 30 , and reducing the equivalent loss terms obtains the relationship k sev c Ef , rest + k am c Ea , rest + k pm c Ep , rest = k pm c Ip , rest + k am c Ia , rest , ( 4 . 32 ) which reduces to k sev c Ef , rest = 0 . Since c Ef , rest > 0 , this implies k sev = 0 . This zero severing rate contradiction could be a result of any one of our model assumptions . Equation 4 . 32 suggests that one or more of the simpliﬁcations should be reconsidered in future models . Some suggested modiﬁcations are : 1 . Variation in parameters between the edge and interior compartments . This revision to our initial assumptions is supported by the dependence of cellular complexes on the rate of coﬁlin transition between forms . The concentrations of such complexes may vary in the edge and interior of the cell . 2 . The assumption of equal concentrations of coﬁlin forms between the edge and interior should be reviewed . This may be most easily approached in a one - dimensional spatial framework as here we work with local average coﬁlin concentrations in each compartment . Here I address the contradiction from Equation 4 . 32 by considering the ﬁrst modiﬁcation , and revise the parameter consistency assumption in the following section . 69 4 . 5 . Model Parameter Analysis 4 . 5 . 3 Distinct Transition Rates in Compartments In Equation 4 . 32 , both the monomer - binding rate k am , and the combined dephosphorylation - monomer - binding rate k pm are assumed to be equivalent in the edge and interior of the cell . However , both of these processes are dependent on the concentration of G - actin available for binding . It has been shown in both experimental and analytical work that concentrations of G - actin are higher in the cell interior due to higher ﬁlaments breakdown , and are depleted at the cell edge where there is an increased polymerization rate [ 26 ? ] . We assume that the coﬁlin - G - actin association rate is negligible in the edge compartment , such that k Eam ≈ 0 , k Epm ≈ 0 . ( 4 . 33 ) We rewrite Equation 4 . 32 with the notation k Iam and k Ipm , to diﬀerentiate between these rates . Therefore , k sev c Ef , rest + k Eam c Ea , rest + k Epm c Em , rest = k Ipm c Ip , rest + k Iam c Ia , rest . This approximation obtains the relationship k sev c Ef , rest ≈ k Ipm c Ip , rest + k Iam c Ia , rest . ( 4 . 34 ) The positivity of rate constants and the condition imposed by Equation 4 . 34 set restrictions on parameter magnitudes . As outlined in previous chapters , we expect ﬁlament severing by coﬁlin to be low in the cell at rest . Here , the magnitude of k sev must be signiﬁcant enough to maintain k Ipm > 0 and k Iam > 0 . Outlined in previous chapters , we assume a very low concentration of active coﬁlin in the resting cell . In Chapter 3 , we used the value c a , rest = 0 . 01 and determined the resulting severing parameter , k sev , by applying model constraints ( Equation 3 . 34 ) . Here we resolve the constraint of Equation 4 . 34 by applying a lower rest state concentration of active coﬁlin c a , rest ≈ 10 − 4 . This is motivated and supported by personal communication with J . Condeelis where he predicts 70 4 . 6 . Further Proposed Simplifying Assumptions a near - zero rest concentration of active coﬁlin . In a similar manner , the remaining rest state relationships , Equations 4 . 28 and 4 . 31 to obtain the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation parameter relationships . The remaining parameters are constrained by Equations 4 . 25 and 4 . 29 . The parameter estimates outlined in Table 4 . 3 were calculated using the temporal data described in Section 3 . 4 . 2 , the volume assumptions outlined in the Appendix , and the scaled resting concentrations , and parameter relationships described here . 4 . 6 Further Proposed Simplifying Assumptions The number of parameters introduced by this expansion creates a model identiﬁcation problem in the absence of additional experimental data . To proceed with parameter estimation and model simulations , we must make some critical assumptions to simplify equations and reduce the number of unknown parameters to be analyzed . Here we start by identifying a large number ( upper bound ) of simpliﬁcations . These should be reviewed in future works . We summarize the parameter simpliﬁcations , motivated by assumptions described in Section 4 . 5 . 3 , and by conversations with J . Condeelis . 1 . Following Section 4 . 5 . 3 , we assume that monomer binding of both active and phospho - coﬁlin occurs at a very low rate in the edge compartment . We diﬀerentiate between edge and interior parameters , as in Equation 4 . 33 , such that k Eam ≈ 0 , k Epm ≈ 0 . Interior rates are denoted as k Iam , k Ipm . 2 . From conversations with J . Condeelis , we identify that phosphorylation rates of active and monomer - bound coﬁlin are indistinguishable in the cell . Eﬀectively , this is an assumption that the monomer - stripping step is negligible within the phosphorylation process , possible 71 4 . 6 . Further Proposed Simplifying Assumptions due to a combined LIM kinase - SSH complex . The phosphorylation rates are expressed as k mp ≈ k p . 3 . We also identify that rebinding of active coﬁlin to PIP 2 at the membrane occurs at a very low rate , due to the instability of active coﬁlin , and its tendency to diﬀuse away from membrane contact after its release . We assume k Ap 2 ≈ 0 , eliminating this interaction from the model . We apply these simplifying assumptions to the compartmental model . The revised schematic of coﬁlin interconversion between forms is shown in Figure 4 . 2 . Parameter values obtained from calculations in this section , including these simplifying assumptions are outlined in Table 4 . 3 .

Simulations of Revised Compartmental Model 4 . 8 Simulations of Revised Compartmental Model We show some preliminary results here based on our current parameter estimates . We initialize the system at the resting steady states outlined in Table 4 . 2 , and stimulate using parameter values in Table 4 . 3 via addition of an EGF signal at 60s , removed at 120s . We obtain the same PLC and PIP 2 results , shown in Figure 3 . 5 and simulate the eﬀect of these dynamics on the coﬁlin pools in the edge and interior compartments , shown in the top and bottom panels of Figure 4 . 8 . 1 respectively . Figure 4 . 4 shows these same coﬁlin results , but dis - plays proﬁles as fractions of total molecules of coﬁlin , for example v E · c Ei = V E · C Ei / V tot · C tot . Two cases of barbed end simulation results are shown in Figure 4 . 5 for parameters in Table 4 . 3 . The top panel uses low hydrolization rate d hyd = 0 . 01 s − 1 , as estimated by experimental results . The bottom panel displays results for the increased hydrolysis , d hyd = 0 . 04 s − 1 , as per discussions with J . Condeelis . 4 . 8 . 1 Discussion of Compartmental Model The compartmental model expands the well - mixed model in several respects . The compartmen - tal framework provides a more accurate representation of the cell , accounting for the high local concentrations of PIP 2 - bound and ﬁlament - bound coﬁlin . The added complexity of interactions and cellular geometry considerations introduce challenges in parameter constraints . Further - more , the lack of available experimental data requires assumptions to simplify the model and identify parameters . However , in view of these increased complexities , and the distinct diﬀerences in the dynamics of coﬁlin pools , the barbed end results of the compartmental and well - mixed models , Figures 3 . 8 , and 4 . 5 are remarkably similar . This may indicate that the interactions introduced in the compartmental are not essentia to generate the barbed end ampliﬁcation . The simpliﬁed coﬁlin interactions of the well - mixed system should be investigated under the compartmental frame - work to conﬁrm this hypothesis . The compartmental model also exhibits similar limitations as those described in Chapter 3 . The increase of ﬁlament - bound coﬁlin increases only to a maxi - mum of 1 . 4 relative to rest levels , failing to reach the 2 - fold increase shown in Figure 1 . 3 from 75 4 . 8 . Simulations of Revised Compartmental Model van Rheenen ( 2007 ) . We propose several experimental considerations to investigate these issues in the discussion of Section 5 . 2 . 1 of Chapter 5 . 76 4 . 8 .

Previously hypothesized to be important only for ﬁlament disassembly , as strictly an actin depolymerizing factor [ 4 , 5 ] , coﬁlin is now unexpectedly at the cell motility forefront as a key determinant of a cell’s ability to detect chemoattractant gradients and direct cell protrusion . Furthermore , coﬁlin may interact synergistically with the Arp2 / 3 complex to promote actin nucleation , and thereby inﬂuence overall cell polarity . Though substantial ground has been made experimentally to identify the underlying mech - anisms of coﬁlin activation in the cell [ 31 , 33 ] , there are many open questions and diﬃcult obstacles to overcome in order to gain a more complete understanding of cancer cell metastasis . The modeling work described in this thesis represents one such initial step in the critical analysis of this important activity cycle . 5 . 1 Discussion of Temporal Model Results The models discussed in Chapters 2 - 4 determine important interactions with the coﬁlin activ - ity cycle and propose the signiﬁcant model considerations for simulation of the initial coﬁlin - dependent peak of barbed ends in a stimulated cell . Both the well - mixed and compartmental models of Chapters 3 and 4 respectively can reproduce temporally accurate barbed end peaks observed in recent experiments [ 15 , 19 , 23 ] ( reproduced in Figure 1 . 4 ) . In both cases , the mag - nitude of the barbed end readout of model simulations is robust to most parameters , including 80 5 . 2 . Proposed Future Considerations severing rate parameter assumptions . A barbed end peak of the 10 - fold magnitude observed under certain experimental conditions [ 23 ] , requires almost complete reduction of PIP 2 levels ( Figures 3 . 11 , and 4 . 5 ) . The similar barbed end results obtained from the well - mixed and compartmental models indicate that some of the complexities introduced in Chapter 4 do not play a signiﬁcant role in barbed end generation . These should be investigated in future work such that a spatial model can be appropriately simpliﬁed to include only the essential level of complexity . 5 . 2 Proposed Future Considerations The models described in this thesis facilitate insight about future considerations for both mod - eling and experimental work . 5 . 2 . 1 Issues for Experimental Investigation The models described in this thesis facilitate insight about future considerations for both model - ing and experimental work . A residual challenge stemmed from the discrepancy between model parameter constraints and experimentally proposed relative magnitudes of the rate that coﬁlin unbinds from ( k off ) and severs ( k sev ) an actin ﬁlament . An example of such a constraint re - lationship is outlined in Section 4 . 5 . 2 . In lieu of conclusive experimental data , modelers must enforce system assumptions to resolve constraints . Experimental work to investigate the rela - tionship between ﬁlament - binding , severing and G - actin binding of coﬁlin in the cell periphery would be invaluable to either support or negate model assumptions . The shortfall of both models to reproduce the observed 2 - fold ampliﬁcation of ﬁlament - bound coﬁlin at 60 s following stimulation requires further attention . We suppose that this issue stems from the ﬁlament severing rate used in both models , motivated in Section 2 . 5 . Through personal communication with J . Condeelis , and supported by recent work outlined in Frantz ( 2008 ) , we identify that ﬁlament severing in vivo is highly dependent on pH levels in the cell [ 14 ] . Stim - ulation with EGF induces a pH change through a pathway independent of the coﬁlin activity 81 5 . 2 . Proposed Future Considerations cycle studied in our model . This eﬀect is proposed to delay the eﬀect of the ampliﬁed severing , and could result in a build up of ﬁlament - bound coﬁlin before the rapid ﬁlament - severing oc - curs . Such a hypothesis requires further experimental motivation . For example , a time proﬁle of ﬁlament - bound coﬁlin density would be beneﬁcial to test model validity . Currently the only in vivo C F data describe the density at 0 s and 60 s following EGF stimulation ( Figure 1 . 3 from van Rheenen ( 2007 ) ) . 5 . 2 . 2 Future Modeling Work Further research into the coﬁlin activity cycle is imperative . Due to the complexity and cost of the experimental study of mammary tumour cells in vivo , the medical and societal importance of understanding the metastatic phenotype notwithstanding , research in this ﬁeld demands the collaboration of experimentalists and modelers . As stated , we propose the models outlined in this thesis as a foundational study into the temporal dynamics of the coﬁlin activity pathway . We focused here on the mechanisms necessary to produce the EGF - induced burst of barbed ends produced by increased coﬁlin activity . There are many potential directions for future modeling work . A logical ﬁrst step would be to extend the model to include spatial properties , by analysing a one dimensional transect of the cell . A model of this form would facilitate a more accurate representation of the dynamic ﬁlament density of the cell . Spatial proﬁle data of the barbed end density produced by the coﬁlin cycle has been developed recently [ 23 , 24 ] . An important distinction from previous spatial models of cell motility in keratocytes [ 9 , 10 ] , the barbed end peak produced by coﬁlin is transient , and would not generate steady state traveling wave solu - tions . This can be traced to the inherently diﬀerent methods of migration of keratocytes and cancer cells . Further investigation into the role of the coﬁlin activity cycle in the overall metastatic phe - notype of cancer cells is also critically important . The advancement of the big picture of how cancer cells migrate and invade is critical to the identiﬁcation of the important targets to inhibit the spread , and consequent fatality of cancer in the body . 82 5 . 2 . Proposed Future Considerations 5 . 2 . 3 Other Perspectives The coﬁlin activity cycle has emerged as a critical regulator of membrane protrusion ; however , tumour cell migration and invasion has been shown to depend on the activity status of several signalling pathways , including the N - Wasp and MENA pathway , critical for both protrusion and the necessary breakdown of the extracellular matrix [ 20 ] . It is through ﬁne coordination of the respective signalling networks that cancer cells are able to produce suﬃcient protrusive force and enzymatic activity to migrate into blood vessels and invade body tissues . As the understanding of N - Wasp and MENA signalling pathways develop experimentally , theoretical investigation of the relationships within the regulation network will be important to test hypotheses and propose interactions to be analysed experimentally . 83 Bibliography [ 1 ] Ernesto Andrianantoandro and Thomas D Pollard .

By adding together the equations for the coﬁlin forms , we ﬁnd that dC 2 dt + dC A dt + dC F dt + dC M dt + dC P dt = 0 88 Appendix which is a check for conservation of the total coﬁlin , i . e . for the fact that C 2 + C A + C F + C M + C P = C tot = constant . Calculation of Conversion Factor α Here we describe calculations to obtain the model conversion parameter α . This parameter serves two purposes : to convert between common units of coﬁlin concentration measurement ( µM ) and barbed end density ( number per µ m 2 ) , and to scale the number of coﬁlin molecules used in a severing event into the number of barbed ends produced . We ﬁrst proceed as described in Mogilner and Edelstein - Keshet 2002 , [ 21 ] , to estimate con - version between units of cellular concentration , µM , and common units of barbed end quantiﬁ - cation , # µm − 2 . We have 1 µM ≈ 10 − 6 · 6x10 23 molec L = 6x10 17 molec dm 3 · 10 − 15 dm 3 1 µm 3 , and therefore , 1 µM ≈ 600 moleculesper µ m 3 . This relationship gives us a working estimate for conversion between unit volumes , ν = 600 µM − 1 µ m − 3 . Experimental approximations of barbed end density in a resting cell , such as those given in Lorenz ( 2004 ) [ 19 ] are generally given in units of number per µ m 2 . This means that we must multiply the parameter ν by the approximate width of the lamellipod . If we approximate the lamellipod width as ω ≈ 0 . 200 µ m , we obtain a unit conversion parameter ˜ ν = ω · ν ≈ 120 µM − 1 µ m − 2 . It is proposed experimentally that a ﬁnite number n , where n ≈ 5 - 7 , of bound coﬁlin molecules are required to force a ﬁlament break . We use this assumption throughout Chapters 89 Appendix 2 - 4 , and use n = 7 in most simulations . Therefore , we approximate the conversion parameter as α = ˜ ν n ≈ 17 . 1 µM − 1 µ m − 2 . Cell Geometry Calculations from Chapter 4 We now give rough calculations for the volumes of the edge and interior compartments use in the compartmental model of Chapter 4 . First we calculate the total volume of the cell , approximating a resting cell as a half - sphere of radius 5 − 10 µ m . The total cellular volume is V tot = 1 2 · 4 π 3 r 3 ≈ 2 π 3 ( 5 - 10 µ m ) 3 , and therefore , V tot ≈ 250 - 2000 µ m 3 . From van Rheenen ( 2007 , 2008 ) , we divide the cell into a periphery or edge compartment , reaching a distance 200 n m into the cell . We denote this volume as V E . We obtain a range of magnitudes for V E depending on assumptions about the geometric representation of this periphery compartment , that is whether data describes the periphery as a thin ring around the edge of the cell ( as if a cross - section ) , or a thin ﬁlm that covers the entire surface of the cell . ( This is still to be discussed ) Working with assumption 2 , V E ≈ 1 24 πr 2 · ω = 2 π ( 5 - 10 µ m ) 2 · 0 . 200 µ m , which gives a range of V E ≈ 40 - 156 µ m 3 . Assumption 1 would result in a much smaller value of V E , we will work with this value for now . We will denote the volume of the interior compartment as V I , it comprises the remaining volume fraction V I = V tot − V E ≈ 200 - 1850 µ m 3 90 Appendix MATLAB Code for Simulations of Temporal Model in Chapter 3 % % Cofilin ODE - FULL with constant filament density clear ; close all % - - - Variables - - - % % PLC = PLC normalized to PLC ( rest ) % P2 = PIP2 normalized to P2 ( rest ) % % C2 = Cofilin inactivated by PIP2 at membrane % CA = Cofilin active free diffusing % CF = Cofilin ready - to - sever filament bound % CM = Cofilin inactivated by G - actin monomer post - severing % CP = Cofilin inactivated by phosphate added by LIMK - freely diffusing % % - - - F = F - actin density normalized to F - actin ( rest ) % B = barbed end density - active polymerizing barbed ends % - - - Parameters - - - % PLC d _ plc = 0 . 018 ; % decay rate I _ stim = d _ plc * 1 . 5 ; % scaled stimulation % PIP2 d _ p2 = 0 . 002 ; % decay d _ hyd = 0 . 01 ; % d _ hyd = 0 . 04 ; % scaled stim hydrolysis ~ 20 * ( resting decay ) psi = 1 ; % binding ratio of C2 : PIP2 91 Appendix % C2 d _ c2 = 0 . 002 ; % base decay rate ( assume = PIP2 decay ) k _ dp = 0 . 5 * d _ c2 ; % dephos rate ( onto membrane ) Assume slow % CF k _ sev = 0 . 67 / 0 . 02 * kp ; % base proportional severing rate % CA kp = k _ dp / 3 . 4 ; % satisfy rest states k _ off = 0 . 08 ; k _ onF = ( k _ sev + k _ off ) / ( 0 . 68 - k _ sev / kp ) ; % CM % kp _ Act = 0 . 01 ; % enhanced phosphorylation % b _ SSH = 0 . 01 ; % reduction in phosphorylation rate due to G - actin removal % CP % B k _ cap = 1 ; % capping rate A = 1000 ; % ratio a * C _ tot / B _ rest % Other n = 7 ; % non - linear factor sat = 0 ; % 1 ; % saturation on / off K = 1 ; % saturation coefficient t _ stim = 60 ; % length of stimulus t _ off = 120 ; CP _ re = 0 . 20 ; % Song ( 2006 ) 92 Appendix C2 _ re = 0 . 10 ; % discussion CF _ re = 0 . 02 ; % van Rheenen ( 2007 ) CM _ re = 0 . 67 ; CA _ re = 0 . 01 ; % estimate C _ rest = [ C2 _ re CA _ re CF _ re CM _ re CP _ re ] ; phi _ F = CF _ re ; % - - - Initials - - - C2 _ check = k _ dp / ( d _ c2 ) * CP _ re ; CA _ check = 1 / ( kp + k _ onF ) * ( d _ c2 * C2 _ re + k _ off * CF _ re ) ; CM _ check = k _ sev / kp * CF _ re ; CF _ check = k _ onF / ( k _ off + k _ sev ) * CA _ re ; CP _ check = kp / k _ dp * ( CA _ re + CM _ re ) ; % verify match defined rest states % B _ re = alpha * k _ sev / kappa * CF _ re ; C _ check = [ C2 _ check CA _ check CF _ check CM _ check CP _ check ] ; % print resting concentrations disp ( C _ check ) % - - - Equations - - - Fsev = @ ( x ) k _ sev * phi _ F * ( x . / phi _ F ) . ^ n ; % severing function % Fsev = @ ( x ) k _ sev * phi _ A * ( x . / phi _ A ) . ^ n . / ( K ^ n + sat * ( x . / CF _ re ) . ^ n ) ; % severing function % Fsev = @ ( x ) k _ sev * x ; 93 Appendix IPLC = @ ( x ) I _ stim * x ; KP _ ACT = @ ( x ) kp _ Act * x ; EGF = @ ( x ) ( x > 60 ) * ( x < 120 ) ; % EGF stimulus % - - - ODEs - - - % S = [ PLC PIP2 C2 CA CF CM CP B T ] ( 9 ) ! dSdt = @ ( t , S ) [ IPLC ( EGF ( S ( 9 ) ) ) - d _ plc * ( S ( 1 ) - 1 ) ; d _ p2 * ( 1 - S ( 2 ) ) - d _ hyd * ( S ( 1 ) - 1 ) * S ( 2 ) ; k _ dp * S ( 2 ) * S ( 7 ) - d _ c2 * S ( 3 ) - d _ hyd * ( S ( 1 ) - 1 ) * S ( 3 ) ; d _ c2 * S ( 3 ) - kp * S ( 4 ) - k _ onF * S ( 4 ) + k _ off * S ( 5 ) + d _ hyd * ( S ( 1 ) - 1 ) * S ( 3 ) ; k _ onF * S ( 4 ) - k _ off * S ( 5 ) - k _ sevb * S ( 5 ) - Fsev ( S ( 5 ) ) ; k _ sevb * S ( 5 ) - kp * S ( 6 ) + Fsev ( S ( 5 ) ) ; kp * S ( 6 ) + kp * S ( 4 ) - k _ dp * S ( 2 ) * S ( 7 ) ; % k _ cap * ( 1 - S ( 8 ) ) + A * Fsev ( S ( 5 ) ) ; % k _ cap * ( Fsev ( S ( 5 ) ) / ( k _ sev * phi _ F ) - S ( 8 ) ) ; A * Fsev ( S ( 5 ) ) - k _ cap * S ( 8 ) 1 ] ; % system ODEs % - - - Integration - - - 94 Appendix options = odeset ( ’abstol’ , 1e - 28 ) ; Sinit = [ 1 1 C2 _ re CA _ re CF _ re CM _ re CP _ re 1 0 ] ; % initial conditions tfinal = 300 ; % final time in s [ T , S ] = ode45 ( dSdt , [ 0 tfinal ] , Sinit , options ) ; 95
