Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 308 : F614 – F626 , 2015 . First published January 13 , 2015 ; doi : 10 . 1152 / ajprenal . 00616 . 2014 . — Podocyte - endothelial cell cross - talk is paramount for maintaining the ﬁltration barrier . The present study investigated the endothelial re - sponse to podocyte injury and its subsequent role in glomeruloscle - rosis using the podocyte - speciﬁc injury model of NEP25 / LMB2 mice . NEP25 / LMB2 mice showed proteinuria and local podocyte loss accompanied by thrombotic microangiopathy on day 8 . Mice showed an increase of glomerular plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 ( PAI - 1 ) mRNA and aberrant endothelial PAI - 1 protein already on day 1 , before thrombosis and proteinuria . A PAI - 1 - speciﬁc inhibitor reduced proteinuria and thrombosis and preserved podocyte numbers in NEP25 / LMB2 mice by stabilization of (cid:2) 1 - integrin translocation . Heparin loading signiﬁcantly reduced thrombotic formation , whereas proteinuria and podocyte numbers were unchanged . Immortalized podocytes treated with PAI - 1 and the urokinase plasminogen activator ( uPA ) complex caused signiﬁcant cell detachment , whereas podocytes treated with PAI - 1 or uPA alone or with the PAI - 1 / uPA complex pretreated with an anti - uPA receptor ( uPAR ) antibody failed to cause detachment . Confocal microscopy and cell surface biotinylation ex - periments showed that internalized (cid:2) 1 - integrin was found together with uPAR in endocytotic vesicles . The administration of PAI - 1 inhibitor or uPAR - blocking antibody protected cultured podocytes from cell detachment . In conclusion , PAI - 1 / uPA complex - mediated uPAR - dependent podocyte (cid:2) 1 - integrin endocytosis represents a novel mechanism of glomerular injury leading to progressive podocytope - nia . This aberrant cross - talk between podocytes and endothelial cells represents a feedforward injury response driving podocyte loss and progressive glomerulosclerosis . podocyte ; plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 ; endocytosis ; integ - rin ; kidney ; pathology PODOCYTE INJURY and the subsequent cell loss promote glomer - ulosclerosis in various glomerular diseases ( 7 , 8 , 21 , 43 ) . However , there is limited information describing the detailed mechanism of podocyte injury - induced glomerulosclerosis . In the remnant kidney model , segmental podocyte loss was ac - companied by synechiae formation to Bowman’s capsule , leading to segmental sclerosis ( 27 , 28 ) . A more progressive podocyte loss model was followed by Notch1 - mediated pari - etal epithelial cell migration leading to collapsing focal seg - mental glomerulosclerosis ( FSGS ) ; thus , podocyte loss triggers a maladaptive extracapillary response leading to sclerosis ( 39 ) . The glomerular ﬁltration barrier is composed of podocytes , the glomerular basement membrane ( GBM ) , and endothelial cells ( 8 ) . Homeostatic regulation of ﬁltration barrier function has been suggested to be maintained by cross - talk signaling between podocytes and endothelial cells . Electron microscopy showed a close association of endothelial cell abnormalities and overlying podocyte injury in various models of glomeru - losclerosis , suggesting a causal relationship between these two cells ( 12 , 22 ) . Bevacizumab is an anti - VEGF antibody used in the treatment of cancer that occasionally causes glomerular thrombotic microangiopathy ( TMA ) , and mice with podocyte - speciﬁc VEGF depletion have intracapillary lesions similar to TMA ( 12 ) . These observations suggest that podocyte - derived VEGF preserves intracapillary homeostasis ; however , the mo - lecular basis of the intracapillary response to podocyte injury and its role in progressive glomerular damage has not been delineated . Blockade of endothelial VEGF transport in mice deﬁcient in EH - domain containing 3 / 4 caused podocyte foot processes effacement ( 13 ) . Shear stress in glomerular endothe - lial cells in vitro changed the actin arrangement in cocultured podocytes via ERK5 - mediated vasodilator - stimulated phos - phoprotein phosphorylation ( 36 ) . Additionally , transient podo - cyturia and heavy proteinuria accompany pregnancy - induced hypertension , of which the pathophysiological base is severe endothelial cell injury ( 1 ) . These ﬁndings suggest that podo - cyte injury triggers intracapillary - derived aberrant podocyte danger signals that underlie glomerular diseases . Plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 ( PAI - 1 ) is synthe - sized by several cell types and is known to inhibit ﬁbrinolysis to stop bleeding by inactivating tissue plasminogen activator and urokinase plasminogen activator ( uPA ) ( 31 , 44 ) . Addition - ally , PAI - 1 has several pleiotropic actions , including effects on cell survival , proliferation , motility , and mobility ( 9 , 24 ) . Notably , PAI - 1 is not expressed in normal kidney glomeruli ( 10 ) . Instead , PAI - 1 is upregulated in glomeruli of patients with FSGS and membranous nephropathy , both of which are Address for reprint requests and other correspondence : M .

PAI - 1 interacts with the uPA receptor ( uPAR ) , which is upregulated in podocytes undergo - ing injury , and the soluble form of uPAR can drive the onset of FSGS via interactions with the podocyte integrin system ( 41 , 42 ) . These ﬁndings suggest a novel action of glomerular PAI - 1 on podocyte diseases . The present study aimed to investigate the glomerular intra - capillary response to primary podocyte injury and its role in disease progression using a transgenic murine model of podo - cyte - selective injury ( 26 ) . Our results showed that aberrant intracapillary signals associated with podocyte injury acceler - ated podocyte loss due to local PAI - 1 / uPA complex formation , which mediated its effect through uPAR - dependent (cid:2) 1 - integrin endocytosis by podocytes . This suggests a novel mechanism for a vicious cycle of podocyte loss . Additionally , since PAI - 1 inhibition ameliorates this exacerbated podocyte loss , our work suggests a novel therapeutic option for podocyte injury - driven glomerulosclerosis . MATERIALS AND METHODS Animal Experiments We used well - established NEP25 mice treated with an immuno - toxin ( LMB2 NEP25 / LMB2 mice ) ( 26 ) , a FSGS model driven by podocyte - speciﬁc injury . NEP25 mice with the C57BL / 6J genetic background selectively express human CD25 on podocytes . Podocyte - speciﬁc injury was induced by human CD25 - speciﬁc antibody ( LMB2 ) , as previously described ( 26 , 39 ) . The toxin was given once ; it disappeared after 35 min and set in motion a cascade leading to podocyte depletion . Mice were treated humanely and housed in animal facilities with free access to food and water , according to protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Use and Care Com - mittee of the University of Tsukuba ( Registered No . 11 - 305 ) . Protocols Protocol 1 : microangiopathic assessment of podocyte injury in NEP25 mice injected with LMB2 . NEP25 mice aged 12 – 18 wk ( n (cid:3) 32 ) were randomly divided into two groups : 1 ) NEP25 / LMB2 mice anesthetized with isoﬂurane and injected with LMB2 intravenously ( n (cid:3) 26 , 4 ng / g body wt ) on day 0 and 2 ) NEP25 / PBS mice injected with PBS intravenously as controls ( n (cid:3) 6 ) . The LMB2 dosages used in this experiment induces severe nephrosis and mice died at 2 wk , as previously described ( 26 , 39 ) . Our preliminary study showed no proteinuria in wild - type littermate mice treated with LMB2 . Histopa - thology was conducted in both groups ( with LMB2 : n (cid:3) 6 and with PBS : n (cid:3) 6 ) . Renal samples were obtained by biopsy ( on days (cid:4) 1 and 8 ) and autopsy at death ( on day 12 ) . Proteinuria was measured on days (cid:4) 1 , 0 , 5 , 8 , and 12 after injection and estimated as the urinary protein - to - creatinine ratio . For real - time PCR , glomeruli were isolated from each animal , NEP / LMB2 mice on days (cid:4) 1 ( n (cid:3) 5 ) , 1 ( n (cid:3) 5 ) , 8 ( n (cid:3) 5 ) , and 12 ( n (cid:3) 5 ) , and were statistically analyzed . Protocol 2 : effect of PAI - 1 inhibition on NEP25 mice injected with LMB2 . NEP25 / LMB2 mice aged 12 – 18 wk ( n (cid:3) 24 ) were divided into two groups : 1 ) PAI - 1 inhibitor - treated NEP25 / LMB2 mice ( NEP25 / LMB2 (cid:5) PI ) and 2 ) vehicle - treated NEP25 / LMB2 mice ( NEP25 / LMB2 (cid:5) VH ) . NEP25 / LMB2 (cid:5) PI mice were administered the PAI - 1 inhibitor TM5484 ( 10 (cid:6) g / g body wt in 0 . 5 % carboxymethyl cellulose sodium , n (cid:3) 13 ) orally for 12 days . As the half - life of LMB2 is 35 min , the PAI - 1 inhibitor was initially administered 2 h after LMB2 injection . NEP25 / LMB2 (cid:5) VH mice ( n (cid:3) 11 ) were adminis - tered vehicle orally for 12 days after LMB2 injection . The details of PAI - 1 inhibitor are summarized below . Histology and real - time PCR were performed on biopsies from NEP25 / LMB2 (cid:5) PI ( n (cid:3) 8 ) and NEP25 / LMB2 (cid:5) VH ( n (cid:3) 6 ) mice on days (cid:4) 1 and 8 and on day 12 at death . Biopsy samples contained over 30 glomeruli in a single section . After LMB2 injection , 24 - h urine samples were collected on days (cid:4) 1 , 0 , 5 , 8 , and 12 . Glomeruli were isolated from both groups ( n (cid:3) 5 mice / group ) at death and used for real - time PCR . The PAI - 1 inhibitor TM5484 ( molecular weight : 384 . 8 g / mol , clogP : 2 . 32 ) was designed based on structures of the PAI - 1 inhibitor TM5007 ( 19 ) . TM5007 was the initial compound identiﬁed virtually by structure - based drug design after undergoing a docking simulation that selected for compounds that ﬁt within the cleft of PAI - 1 ( s3A in the human PAI - 1 three - dimensional structure ) and was accessible to insertion of the reactive center loop ( 18 , 19 ) . The design of TM5484 was processed by an extensive structural activity relationship study among (cid:7) 450 novel derivatives of TM5007 with comparatively low molecular weight ( 400 – 550 g / mol ) without symmetrical structure ( 17 ) . The inhibitory activity of TM5484 was shown in vitro by a chromogenic assay ( IC 50 : 3 . 56 (cid:6) M ) , and its speciﬁcity was conﬁrmed by demonstrating that it did not inhibit other serpins , such as anti - thrombin III and (cid:8) 2 - antiplasmin . A repeated dose toxicity study of TM5484 was assessed for 2 wk in ﬁve rats per gender per group , and no adverse effect level was concluded at 30 mg / kg . Regarding the reverse mutation Ames test , evaluation of TM5484 produced a neg - ative result . The effect of TM5484 on human ether - a - go - go - related gene ( hERG ) electric current was investigated in human embryonic kidney - 293 cells transfected with the hERG gene . TM5484 was found not to have an effect on hERG electric current at concentrations up to 10 (cid:6) mol / l . We assessed the average bleeding time in NEP25 / PBS mice by tail cut ( n (cid:3) 3 ) . Average bleeding times after TM5484 treatment were 165 (cid:9) 39 . 7 s at preadministration , 375 (cid:9) 68 . 7 s at maximal time ( 2 h for TM5484 , P (cid:10) 0 . 05 vs . preadministration ) , and 341 . 7 (cid:9) 3 . 33 s at 24 h , which indicated the effects of TM5484 in the NEP25 mouse model . Protocol 3 : effect of heparin loading on NEP25 / LMB2 mice . NEP25 / LMB2 mice aged 12 – 18 wk ( n (cid:3) 10 ) were divided into two groups : 1 ) NEP25 / LMB2 mice treated with 25 units of heparin sodium ( Fuji Pharma , Tokyo , Japan ) through subcutaneous injection twice daily from days (cid:4) 1 to 11 ( NEP25 / LMB2 (cid:5) Hep ; n (cid:3) 5 ) and 2 ) NEP25 / LMB2 mice treated with PBS ( NEP25 / LMB2 (cid:5) PBS ; n (cid:3) 5 ) , which were considered controls . The anticoagulant effect of heparin was determined by the coagulation time , as revealed by a recalciﬁ - cation coagulation assay ( 16 ) . The dosage of heparin sodium used was determined by keeping the coagulation time three times longer than that for control mice . Histology was performed on day (cid:4) 1 by biopsy and on day 12 at death . Proteinuria was estimated on days 0 , 5 , 8 , and 12 . Number of Wilms tumor 1 ( WT - 1 ) - positive cells and thrombosis scores were estimated on days (cid:4) 1 and 12 . Staining and Morphological Analysis Kidneys were ﬁxed in 4 % paraformaldehyde and embedded in parafﬁn . Parts of the kidney samples were incubated in graded ( 10 – 20 % ) sucrose - PBS solution and frozen for immunoﬂuorescence or were ﬁxed with 2 % glutaraldehyde for transmission electron microscopy . Parafﬁn sections ( 2 (cid:6) m ) were processed for periodic acid - Schiff staining , periodic acid - silver methenamine staining , and immunostaining with speciﬁc primary antibodies , as shown in Table 1 . Immunohistochemical staining was performed using standard proce - dures with an Avidin / Biotin Blocking Kit ( Vector Laboratories , Bur - lingame , CA ) and peroxidase - conjugated EnVision (cid:5) Single Reagent ( Dako , Glostrup , Denmark ) , and sections were visualized using di - aminobenzidine ( DAB substrate - chromogen system , Dako ) or ni - troblue tetrazolium ( Roche Diagnostics , Mannheim , Germany ) ac - cording to the manufacturers’ instructions . For immunoﬂuorescence analysis , frozen sections and parafﬁn sections were used . Primary antibodies ( (cid:2) 1 - integrin , synaptopodin , PAI - 1 , and CD31 ) were reacted with secondary antibodies labeled with Alexa 488 or 568 ( Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA ) or rhod - amine - conjugated secondary antibodies , respectively .

Nuclear staining was performed using 4 = , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole . For the quantitative determination of podocyte numbers , the WT - 1 - positive cells were counted in all glomeruli of each section on days (cid:4) 1 and 8 ( (cid:7) 30 glomeruli / mice ) , and at least 70 randomly selected glomeruli were counted on day 12 under high - power magniﬁcation ( (cid:11) 400 ) . Average podocyte numbers per glomerulus were calculated on the basis of individual values . Thrombi and sclerosis were evaluated in periodic acid - silver methenamine - stained parafﬁn sections . Glomeru - lar sclerosis and thrombosis scores were determined as follows . Each glomerulus was graded on a scale of 0 – 4 , representing the thrombotic or sclerotic area involving 0 % , 1 – 25 % , 26 – 50 % , 51 – 75 % , or (cid:7) 75 % of the glomerulus , respectively . Glomeruli ( n (cid:7) 70 ) for each section were averaged and deﬁned as the thrombosis score or sclerosis score per mouse , separately ( n (cid:3) 6 ) . RNA Extraction and Quantitative Real - Time PCR Glomerular isolation was performed using ion powder perfusion and a magnet , as previously described ( 38 ) . Total RNA was isolated using ISOGEN ( Wako Pure Chemical Industries , Osaka , Japan ) . Total RNA was reverse transcribed using the Thermoscript RT - PCR System ( Invitrogen , Karlsruhe , Germany ) for ﬁrst - strand cDNA . For quanti - tative analysis , all measured values were normalized to GAPDH gene expression using the (cid:12)(cid:12) C t method ( C t is threshold cycle ) , and results are presented as relative expression in arbitrary units . All primers used are shown in Table 2 . Western Blot Analysis Samples were solubilized in RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors . Cytoplasmic proteins from cultured podocytes were extracted using a subcellular protein fractionation kit for cultured cells ( Thermo Scien - tiﬁc , Pittsburgh , PA ) . Proteins were separated by 4 – 12 % polyacryl - amide gel electrophoresis ( SDS - PAGE ) and transferred to polyvi - nylidene diﬂuoride membranes ( PALL , Port Washington , NY ) . Blots were incubated with the primary antibodies shown in Table 1 . After being washed in blocking solution , primary antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase - conjugated antibody ( GE Healthcare , Buckinghamshire , UK ) and a chemiluminescent substrate . Cell Experiments The immortalized mouse podocyte cell line ( passages 10 – 16 ) used was a generous gift from Dr . Sakairi ( Gunma University ) ( 33 ) . Cell differentiation was induced as previously described ( 39 ) . All cell experiments were done under the following conditions and compared . Podocytes were treated in vitro with either uPA , PAI - 1 alone , the PAI - 1 / uPA complex ( PAI - 1 / uPA ) , or the PAI - 1 / uPA complex fol - lowed by anti - uPAR antibody ( 4 g / ml , R & D Systems , Minneapolis , MN ) pretreatment ( anti - uPAR (cid:5) PAI - 1 / uPA ) . All compounds used were set by equimolar concentrations ( 5 nM ) . Glycosylated mouse PAI - 1 ( stable mutant ) and active two - chain high - molecular - weight mouse uPA were purchased from Molecular Innovations ( Novi , MI ) . The PAI - 1 / uPA complex was prepared by reacting 5 nM uPA with PAI - 1 for 10 min at 37°C ( 40 ) . After acid treatment for tight cell adhesion ( 5 , 6 ) , podocytes in individual wells were treated with uPA , PAI - 1 , the PAI - 1 / uPA complex , or anti - uPAR antibody before PAI - 1 / uPA complex administration . Anti - uPAR antibody was prepared by preincubation for 30 min at 37°C before the addition of the PAI - 1 / uPA complex . Podocyte Detachment Assay The podocyte detachment assay was analyzed by two blinded observers ( M . Nagata and T . Ueno ) . Equal numbers of podocytes ( 4 (cid:11) 10 3 cells / well ) were seeded on 24 - well plates precoated with collagen type I ( 0 . 03 % ) and treated under each condition described above . Biotinylation of Cell Surface Protein Experiments Surface biotinylation was performed using the Cell Surface Protein Isolation Kit ( Pierce , Rockford , IL ) . Differentiated podocytes were biotinylated for 30 min at 4°C with 0 . 25 mg / ml sulfo - NHS - SS - biotin and then sonicated with lysis buffer . The biotinylated protein was extracted by an incubation with streptavidin - coupled beads for 60 min . After this , sample buffer containing DTT was added to the extraction buffer , and samples were incubated for 60 min using an end - over - end mixer followed by centrifugation . This procedure was performed for podocytes treated with uPA , PAI - 1 , the PAI - 1 / uPAR complex , or anti - uPAR (cid:5) PAI - 1 / uPAR , and (cid:2) 1 - integrin expression was estimated by Western blot analysis . Extraction of the Cytosolic Fraction We used a subcellular protein fractionation kit for cultured cells ( Thermo Scientiﬁc ) . Cells were detached by trypsin EDTA acid and Table 1 .

After cells were washed , they were transferred to a microtube and pelleted by centrifugation at 500 g for 3 min . The cell pellet was obtained by discarding the superna - tant . After this , cell extraction buffer with protease inhibitors was added and incubated with gentle mixing for 60 min at 4°C . The supernatant was immediately extracted as the cytoplasmic fraction after centrifugation at 500 g for 5 min . Immunoﬂuorescence in Cultured Podocytes Podocytes grown on collagen type I - coated coverslips were treated under each condition described above and ﬁxed with 4 % paraformal - dehyde in PBS . After being blocked with 50 mM glycine - PBS , podocytes were incubated with anti - uPAR antibody or anti - (cid:2) 1 - integ - rin antibody overnight followed by secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa 488 ( Life Technologies ) or rhodamine for 2 h . Double Immunogold Labeling of Ultrathin Cryosections uPA - and PAI - 1 / uPA complex - treated cells were ﬁxed in periodate lysine paraformaldehyde ﬁxative for 6 h , pelleted , and then resus - pended in 2 . 0 % agarose ( Wako Pure Chemical Industries , Osaka , Japan ) as previously described ( 23 ) . The grids were incubated on anti - (cid:2) 1 - integrin antibody and anti - uPAR antibody in 1 % BSA over - night at 4°C followed by secondary antibodies of goat anti - rabbit 5 - nm gold ( BB , Cardiff , UK ) or goat anti - rat 10 - nm gold ( BB ) for 2 h at room temperature . Sections were stained with both uranyl acetate and lead citrate and inspected under a transmission electron micro - scope ( model JEM - 1400 , JEOL , Tokyo , Japan ) at 80 kV . Statistics Results are presented as means (cid:9) SE . Comparisons between two groups were performed using two - tailed Student’s t - tests . Compari - sons between three or more groups were performed using nonre - peated - measures ANOVA . P values of (cid:10) 0 . 05 were considered statis - tically signiﬁcant . In the ﬁgures , P values are indicated as * P (cid:10) 0 . 05 , * * P (cid:10) 0 . 01 , and * * * P (cid:10) 0 . 001 . RESULTS Podocyte Depletion Caused Local Thrombotic Microangiopathy NEP25 / LMB2 mice developed signiﬁcant proteinuria on days 8 and 12 compared with control mice , and this was parallel with the decrease of WT - 1 positive podocyte numbers , which was further diminished in glomeruli with thrombi compared with those without ( Fig . 1 , A – C ) . Serial section with ﬁbrin immunostaining showed the association of local intracapillary thrombi with overlaying podocyte damage ( Fig . 1 , D and E ) . This was conﬁrmed by double immuno - labeling showing that segments lacking WT - 1 - positive cells were associated with ﬁbrin in the corresponding capillary ( Fig . 1 F ) . Elec - tron microscopy demonstrated that intracapillary coagulation debris and mesangiolysis were associated with degeneration or detachment of overlaying podocytes ( Fig . 1 G ) . These ﬁndings indicate that podocyte loss causes local thrombotic microangiopathy in this model . Fig . 1 . Podocyte - speciﬁc injury evoked pro - gressive proteinuria and microangiopathy .

PAI - 1 / uPA Complex - Induced Podocyte Detachment In Vitro Required uPAR - Dependent (cid:2) 1 - Integrin Endocytosis The mechanism underlying podocyte protection by the PAI - 1 inhibitor in vivo was tested using established mouse podocytes in vitro . PAI - 1 / uPA - treated podocytes showed a signiﬁcant cell detachment with a loss of arborized shape , whereas this was not seen in podocytes treated with uPA and PAI - 1 alone . Apoptotic bodies and caspase - 3 - positive cells were not observed upon podocyte detachment ( data not shown ) . In addition , podocytes treated with anti - uPAR anti - body targeting the PAI - 1 / uPA complex ( anti - uPAR (cid:5) PAI - 1 / uPA ) did not exhibit podocyte detachment , indicating that PAI - 1 / uPA - mediated podocyte detachment was uPAR depen - dent ( Fig . 7 ) . Using confocal immunoﬂuorescence microscopy , cultured podocytes treated with the PAI - 1 / uPA complex ex - pressed (cid:2) 1 - integrin in the cytoplasm that colocalized with uPAR expression , despite the absence of such translocation in podocytes treated with uPA or PAI - 1 alone or with anti - uPAR (cid:5) PAI - 1 / uPA ( Fig . 8 , A and B ) .

The cytoplasmic shift of (cid:2) 1 - integrin and uPAR was conﬁrmed by counting gold particles ( Fig . 9 D ) . DISCUSSION The present study describes novel mechanism of podocyte loss by aberrant intracapillary signaling , which , in turn , targets podocytes by pathological PAI - 1 - mediated and uPAR - depen - dent (cid:2) 1 - integrin internalization , resulting cell detachment . Our ﬁrst observation was that induced podocyte - speciﬁc injury correlated with thrombosis in glomeruli . Double immu - nolabeling and electron microscopy displayed an association of focal thrombi with damage in overlying podocytes . Because our heparin loading experiments suppressed thrombi without changing podocyte number , thrombosis has no signiﬁcant re - sponsibility for podocyte loss . These ﬁndings support the notion that podocyte dysfunction causes glomerular TMA and suggests that podocyte - intracapillary signaling is locally regu - lated . Generally , TMA appeared in the setting of severe endo - thelial cell injury , such as hemolytic uremic syndrome , which seems to be mediated by PAI - 1 , a strong effector of antiﬁbrin - olysis ( 2 , 31 ) . Normally , PAI - 1 is not produced in kidneys but is elevated in glomeruli in cases with crescentic glomerulone - phritis , which accompanies ﬁbrin exudation ( 20 ) . This may reﬂect severe glomerular endothelial cell injury and is thought to be a response to tissue ﬁbrinolysis . In our model of NEP25 / LMB2 mice , expression of glomer - ular PAI - 1 protein revealed some unique features , i . e . , a diffuse pattern in a de novo fashion in glomerular endothelial cells as early as 1 day after LMB2 injection . Since LMB2 binds to human CD25 and mouse endothelial cells do not express it , glomerular PAI - 1 upregulation 1 day after LMB2 injection is caused by LMB2 - induced podocyte injury but not a direct action of LMB2 in glomerular endothelial cells ( 26 ) . Notably , this was before decreases in VEGF and eNOS mRNA expression as well as the formation of glomerular TMA lesions . The ultrastructure on day 1 showed podocyte foot process effacement accompanied by endothelial cell swelling but not with platelet accumulation or thrombi in NEP25 / LMB2 mice . Because LMB2 immediately binds to and injures podo - cytes , diffuse PAI - 1 expression in endothelial cells on day 1 suggests that PAI - 1 synthesis is an early endothelial response to podocyte injury but may not be the same for antiﬁbrinolytic actions . Of note , we also demonstrated de novo expression of uPAR in podocytes , not in endothelial cells , on day 1 . Thus , podocyte injury rapidly activates aberrant endothelium - podo - cyte signaling in vivo . At the later stage where glomerular TMA was apparent , PAI - 1 was also expressed in preserved capillaries but not in the portion of thrombi , implicating that Fig . 5 . (cid:2) 1 - Integrin was expressed in the cyto - plasm of podocytes in NEP25 / LMB2 mice . In control mice , (cid:2) 1 - integrin was detected in the mesangium and along the glomerular basement membrane ( GBM ) and did not overlap with synaptopodin . In NEP25 / LMB2 (cid:5) VH mice on days 3 and 12 , (cid:2) 1 - integrin was found in the podocyte cytoplasm and occasionally colocal - ized with synaptopodin . Such (cid:2) 1 - integrin trans - location was not apparent in NEP25 / LMB2 (cid:5) PI mice on days 3 and 12 . Magniﬁcation : (cid:11) 600 .

The absence of PAI - 1 at thrombi may be due to the loss of endothelial cells , as shown in our electron microscopy exper - iments ( Fig . 1 G ) . Importantly , we showed colocalization of PAI - 1and synaptopodin in this late stage . Since uPAR , a receptor of PAI - 1 , was shown to be expressed in podocytes among several models of nephrosis ( 41 ) , endothelium - derived PAI - 1 may pass through the GBM and form a complex with uPAR during podocyte injury . PAI - 1 is known to have pleiotropic functions , including effects on cell motility , activation of apoptosis , and promotion of cell senescence , some of which may contribute to the progression of glomerular damage ( 9 , 11 , 24 , 35 ) . Although several reports have shown glomerular PAI - 1 expression in glomerular diseases ( 14 , 29 , 45 ) , the role of PAI - 1 in podocyte diseases has not been extensively explored . In this regard , the present study investigated the actions of PAI - 1 during podo - cyte injury by several experiments . First , we administered a PAI - 1 inhibitor immediately after LMB2 treatment and found suppression of thrombosis and maintained VEGF and eNOS levels in NEP25 / LMB2 mice , suggestive of endothelial pro - tection . Moreover , PAI - 1 inhibitor treatment showed signiﬁ - cantly less proteinuria and higher podocyte numbers in NEP25 / LMB2 mice compared with vehicle - treated NEP25 / LMB2 mice . This suggests that intracapillary PAI - 1 impacted the glomerular ﬁltration barrier and particularly promoted podo - cyte loss . Second , because it is unknown whether the effect of PAI - 1 inhibitor on podocyte protection was by direct or indi - rect actions through ﬁbrinolysis , we performed heparin loading experiments in our model . Heparin loading signiﬁcantly re - duced thrombosis but had no effects on proteinuria and podo - cyte number . These observations may provide a novel action of PAI - 1 , other than ﬁbrinolysis , as an aberrant intracapillary podocyte danger signal during podocyte injury . Our hypothesis that primary podocyte injury causes second - ary podocyte loss by the above - described PAI - 1 mechanism suggests a positive feedback loop of podocyte loss . Using podocyte - speciﬁc CD25 chimeric mice , Matsusaka et al . ( 25 ) showed that LMB2 induced primary podocyte injury in CD25 - positive podocytes only , even though neighboring podocytes lacking CD25 were secondarily damaged . This observation provides important clues to understanding progressive glomer - ulosclerosis promoted by a vicious cycle of podocyte loss as a “domino effect , ” and our hypothesis of an intracapillary danger signal toward podocytes may explain this phenomenon . Our additional experiments in vitro disclosed the mechanism whereby intracapillary PAI - 1 upregulation triggered secondary to podocyte loss . Basically , motility of cells requires the proper function of cytoskeletal and cell membrane dynamics ( 4 ) . It is Fig . 6 . Interference with thrombosis by heparin loading had no effect on proteinuria and podocyte numbers . A : proteinuria levels were similar in mice treated with ( NEP25 / LMB2 (cid:5) Hep group ; n (cid:3) 5 ) or without heparin ( NEP25 / LMB2 (cid:5) PBS group ; n (cid:3) 5 ) .

Integrins are key mole - cules maintaining cell integrity via matrix - cytoskeleton signal - ing as transmembrane receptors ( 4 ) . In the podocyte , (cid:8) 3 (cid:2) 1 - integrin is the main contributor of tight adhesion of podocytes to the GBM ( 32 ) . Podocyte - speciﬁc (cid:2) 1 - integrin ﬂox / ﬂox mice exhibit foot process effacement , podocyte loss , and glomerulosclerosis ( 30 ) . Czekay et al . ( 5 , 6 ) showed that PAI - 1 / uPA complex - bound uPAR on the cell membrane promoted endocytosis of (cid:8) v (cid:2) 3 - , (cid:8) v (cid:2) 5 - , and (cid:8) 3 (cid:2) 1 - integrins . In the present study , NEP25 / LMB2 mice showed (cid:2) 1 - integrin in the podocyte cytoplasm on day 12 , which was not observed in control mice , and was blocked by PAI - 1 inhibitor . Additionally , immortalized podocytes treated with the PAI - 1 / uPA complex underwent signiﬁcant cell detachment . Confocal immunoﬂuorescence microscopy showed (cid:2) 1 - integrin and uPAR internalization only in PAI - 1 / uPA - treated podo - cytes . PAI - 1 / uPAR - mediated (cid:2) 1 - integrin internalization was conﬁrmed by decreased membrane - localized (cid:2) 1 - integrin by biotinylated experiments and an increase of (cid:2) 1 - integrin protein in the cytoplasmic fraction . Furthermore , the double immuno - gold labeling technique displayed colocalization of (cid:2) 1 - integrin and uPAR within endocytotic vesicles after PAI - 1 / uPA treat - ment , suggesting endocytosis as a mechanism of (cid:2) 1 - integrin internalization . In patients with FSGS , soluble uPAR is elevated in the serum and on the surface of podocytes . Wei et al . ( 41 , 42 ) recently reported that uPAR - activated podocyte (cid:8) v (cid:2) 3 - integrin resulted in the effacement of foot processes through disruption of the actin cytoskeleton . This mechanism could prime podo - cyte for detachment and then could be followed by endothelial PAI - 1 induction , setting a progressive mechanism into motion . Clearly , more experiments are needed to link ( soluble ) uPAR - mediated podocyte injury and PAI - 1 - uPAR - (cid:2) 1 - integrin inter - nalization , even though it is known that repression of (cid:2) 1 - integrin activates (cid:2) 3 - integrin via Rac1 and ERK ( 15 ) . These observations , together with our present ﬁndings , suggest that primary podocyte injury accelerates progressive podocyte loss by upregulation of endothelial PAI - 1 - mediated podocyte (cid:2) 1 - integrin endocytosis . uPAR may have an important role in orchestrating disruption of integrin homeostatic functions to accelerate the cascade of responses leading to podocyte loss . The present study not only describes a novel mechanism of podocyte loss but also suggests that the PAI - 1 inhibitor may be a possible therapeutic option for podocyte protection through the stabilization of (cid:2) 1 - integrin , similar to the sug - gested role for the B7 - 1 inhibitor abatacept ( 46 ) .

Using immunoﬂuorescence microcopy , cultured podocytes treated with the PAI - 1 / uPA complex expressed (cid:2) 1 - integrin in the cytoplasm that colocalized with uPAR , whereas no translocalization occurred in podo - cytes treated with uPA or PAI - 1 alone .

In conclusion , primary podocyte injury stimulates upregula - tion of endothelial PAI - 1 , with the uPA / uPAR complex on the podocyte surface , resulting in podocyte detachment secondary to (cid:2) 1 - integrin endocytosis ( Fig . 10 ) . This mechanism may explain a vicious cycle of podocyte injury . Therefore , we suggest PAI - 1 inhibition as a possible therapeutic option for the progression of glomerular injury inhibiting the vicious podocyte domino effect . Fig . 10 . Schematic demonstration of the podocyte domino effect by PAI - 1 / uPAR - mediated (cid:2) 1 - integrin endocytosis . From the left , damaged podocytes repressed VEGF expression , leading to endothelial dysfunction . Damaged endothelial cells produced and secreted PAI - 1 ( molecular mass : 45 kDa ) , which binds to circulating uPA ( molecular mass : 31 . 5 kDa ) either in the capillary or on the podocyte surface and then makes a complex with uPAR on the podocyte surface . The complex formation is able to bind (cid:2) 1 - integrin , which is known as a strong assembler of podocyte - GBM attachment . With the aid of a large endocytotic receptor , LDL receptor - related protein ( LRP ) , on the podocyte surface ( the expression of LRP was detected in vivo and cultured podocytes by real - time PCR in our preliminary experiments ) , (cid:2) 1 - integrin is translocated to the podocyte cytoplasm by endocytosis with the PAI - 1 / uPA / uPAR complex . Finally , (cid:2) 1 - integrin - lost primary healthy podocytes undergo detachment from the GBM . Fig . 9 . The PAI - 1 / uPA complex induced (cid:2) 1 - integrin and uPAR translocation via an endosomal pathway .
