LETTER doi : 10 . 1038 / nature10241 A Polycomb - based switch underlying quantitative epigenetic memory Andrew Angel 1 * , Jie Song 2 * , Caroline Dean 2 & Martin Howard 1 The conserved Polycomb repressive complex 2 ( PRC2 ) generates trimethylation of histone 3 lysine 27 ( H3K27me3 ) 1 , 2 , a modifica - tion associated with stable epigenetic silencing 3 , 4 . Much is known about PRC2 - induced silencing but key questions remain concern - ing its nucleation and stability . Vernalization , the perception and memory of winter in plants , is a classic epigenetic process that , in Arabidopsis , involves PRC2 - based silencing of the floral repressor FLC 5 , 6 . The slow dynamics of vernalization , taking place over weeks in the cold , generate a level of stable silencing of FLC in the subsequent warm that depends quantitatively on the length of theprior cold . These features make vernalization an ideal experi - mental system to investigate both the maintenance of epigenetic states and the switching between them . Here , using mathematical modelling , chromatin immunoprecipitation and an FLC : GUS reporter assay , we show that the quantitative nature of vernaliza - tion is generated by H3K27me3 - mediated FLC silencing in the warm in a subpopulation of cells whose number depends on the length of the prior cold . During the cold , H3K27me3 levels pro - gressively increase at a tightly localized nucleation region within FLC . At the endof the cold , numerical simulations predict that such a nucleation region is capable of switching the bistable epigenetic state of an individual locus , with the probability of overall FLC coverage by silencing H3K27me3 marks depending on the length of cold exposure . Thus , the model predicts a bistable pattern ofFLC gene expression in individual cells , a prediction we verify using the FLC : GUS reporter system . Our proposed switching mechanism , involving the local nucleation of an opposing histone modification , is likely to be widely relevant in epigenetic reprogramming . In Arabidopsis , vernalization requires the plant - homeodomain – PRC2 complex ( PHD – PRC2 ) , whose components include SWINGER ( an E ( Z ) histone methyltransferase homologue ) , together with VIN3 , VRN5 and VEL1 ( PHD proteins required to generate high H3K27me3 levels ) 7 – 10 . PRC2complexessuchasthisarethoughttoinitiatetrimethy - lation of H3K27 and then spread this modification through a positive feedback loop where they both bind to H3K27me3 and trimethylate other nucleosomes 7 – 10 . In principle , this process could generate stable maintenance of histone modifications even when perturbed by DNA replication , where on average half of the modifications could be lost by the insertion of unmodified nucleosomes . In general , however , how to establishstableepigeneticsilencingatalevelthatdependsquantitativelyonthelevelofatransientstimulusisnotunderstood . In an effort to answer this question , we combined chromatin immu - noprecipitation ( ChIP ) experiments with mathematical modelling to dissect the vernalization process . This required high - resolution ana - lysis of H3K27me3 during vernalization as a function of space across the FLC locus and time . Previously , we had demonstrated that PRC2 was associated with the whole FLC locus before cold , and that this correlatedwith an epigenetically stable low level of silencing 9 , 11 . After 8 weeks of cold , a PHD – PRC2 complex had formed atone particular site withinthe geneandonlyafterplantswere returnedtothewarmdidthe PHD proteins associate more generally with PRC2 over the locus . This association resulted in high levels of H3K27me3 , which epigenetically maintained the fully silent state . Therefore , we needed to explore the quantitative accumulation of silencing during the cold . Figure 1a ( and Supplementary Fig . 1 ) shows the H3K27me3 profile across FLC , in non - vernalized plants and also after 2 and 4 weeks of cold ( at 4 u C ) . A localized peak of H3K27me3 develops ( close to exon 1 , see Fig . 1 ) , the level of which increases with increasing length of cold , in agreement with previous results 12 . For longer periods of cold ( 6 and 8 weeks ) , this nucleation seems to saturate , with some limited general increase in H3K27me3 levels across the rest of the locus ( Fig . 1b and Supplemen - tary Fig . 2 ) . During the cold , the rising levels of H3K27me3 in the nucleation region are correlated with an increase in expression of the PHD protein VIN3 ( refs 7 , 8 ) , whose concentration levels may therefore constitute one of the primary read - outs of the length of cold . However , VIN3 expression returns to low levels immediately ( within one day ) after return to the warm : the memory of the cold implicit in the VIN3 concentration levels must therefore be converted into a * Theseauthorscontributedequallytothiswork . 1 DepartmentofComputationalandSystemsBiology , JohnInnesCentre , NorwichResearchPark , NorwichNR47UH , UK . 2 DepartmentofCellandDevelopmentalBiology , JohnInnesCentre , Norwich ResearchPark , NorwichNR47UH , UK . – 2 , 000 0 2 , 000 4 , 000 6 , 000 8 , 000 0 0 . 5 1 H 3 K 27 m e 3 – 2 , 000 0 2 , 000 4 , 000 6 , 000 8 , 000 0 0 . 5 1 H 3 K 27 m e 3 – 2 , 000 0 2 , 000 4 , 000 6 , 000 8 , 000 0 0 . 5 1 H 3 K 27 m e 3 4 weeks , T0 2 weeks , T0 NV 8 weeks , T0 6 weeks , T0 4 weeks , T0 8 weeks , T7 6 weeks , T7 4 weeks , T7 2 weeks , T7 NV Nucleationregion Distalregion Promoter Intron 1 Exon1 Exon 7 FLC = 1 kb a b c Figure 1 | H3K27me3 ChIP experiments . a , H3K27me3 profile across FLC for non - vernalized plants ( NV ) and after 2 or 4 weeks of cold , with 0 days of warm ( T0 ) . b , H3K27me3profileacross FLC after4 , 6or8weeksofcold , with0 days of warm ( T0 ) . c , H3K27me3 profile across FLC for non - vernalized plants and 7 days post - cold ( T7 ) after 2 , 4 , 6 or 8 weeks of cold ( top ) and schematic layout of FLC gene ( bottom ) , with definitions of nucleation and distal regions .

We measured therefore the H3K27me3 profile across FLC 7 days after the plants had been transferred to the warm ( Fig . 1c and Supplemen - tary Fig . 3 ) . The profile changed rather little in the nucleation region but rose quantitatively across the rest of the FLC locus according to the length of the cold period ( Supplementary Fig . 4 ) . This quantitative increase correlated with decreased FLC expression ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) , and was consistent with H3K27me3 levels being a key element in epigenetic memory of the cold after return to the warm . For shorter periods of cold , levels of ChIP - measured H3K27me3 at the nucleation region depended quantitatively on the length of the cold period , and could therefore potentially act to switch quantitatively the epigenetic state of the locus after return to the warm . Epigenetic states are , however , intrinsicallystable ( inthecaseofvernalization , overmany weeks ormonths ) . Itwas therefore unclear whetherthe small sizeofthe nucleation region ( Fig . 1a ) would be sufficient to cause a quantitative switch in the epigenetic state of the FLC locus . To answer this question , we turned to mathematical modelling 13 – 19 . Previous modelling of epi - genetic states had focused primarily on cell - autonomous dynamics in yeast 13 , 15 – 18 . We wondered whether a similar cell - autonomous mech - anism could also explain the quantitative response to the cold seen in vernalization . The above data provided an ideal opportunity to test such a model . In essence , our model is an implementation of a Polycomb - based switch , incorporating highly dynamic rewriting of histone modifications on a timescale of minutes ( see Fig . 2 and SupplementaryInformationfor details ) . Therapiddynamicsofhistone modifications are vital as they allow for the formation of bistable epi - genetic states , despite the noisy turnover of nucleosomes , both con - tinuously ( on a timescale of tens of minutes 20 ) and discretely at DNA replication ( on a timescale of days 21 , 22 ) . The model utilizes a simplified set of possible histone modifications : M ( H3K27me3 ) , U ( unmodified ) and A ( activating ) ( other possible assumptions are discussed in the Supplementary Information ) , where histones with the M or A modi - fication antagonistically promote the transition of other histones towards the same modification , leading to positive feedback 13 , 16 . At the high levels of noise potentially generated by noisy nucleosome turnover and subsequent random histone mark addition , the presence of spatially long - ranged interactions between histones is an important factor inthe formation of bistable states 13 . Inour model , starting from a state with the FLC locus covered by A modifications , two additional processes contribute to the switch - like behaviour at the end of the cold intothe opposingstate , where the locus ispredominantly covered byM modifications . The first process is a site - specific nucleation of the opposing M modification mediated by a cold - induced increase of VIN3 expression ( motivated by the localized increase of H3K27me3 levels , see Fig . 1a ) . The second process is a permanent PHD – PRC2 - mediated bias in the histone dynamics towards the M modification on return to the warm , motivated by the observed post - cold spread of the PHD protein VRN5 across the locus 9 . The combination of these two processes enhances the probability of switching between the two bistable epigenetic states , before nucleation is lost ( due to clearance of VIN3 on a timescale of days at the end of the cold ) and the potential to switch is greatly diminished . We simulated the above model in 10 , 000 individual FLC loci , and attempted to fit unconstrained model parameters to our experimental ChIP data ( see Supplementary Table 2 ) . In Fig . 3a – d we show the simulated population - averaged levels of the M modification averaged separately over the nucleation region ( five - histones wide ) and the rest of the locus . Also shown are the experimental H3K27me3 values for non - vernalized plants and 0 and 7 days after 2 , 4 , 6 or 8 weeks of cold , averaged separately over the nucleation and distal regions of FLC ( as defined in Fig . 1 ) . We find good overall agreement with the observed data . During the cold , some limited increase of H3K27me3 levels does occur in distal regions ( Fig . 1b ) . However , by tracking the dynamics of individual simulated FLC loci , we predict that these low levels of H3K27me3 arise from a large subpopulation of cells with little or no H3K27me3 coverage away from the nucleation region and a small subpopulation where H3K27me3 substantially covers the locus ( occu - pying , 90 % of histones , limited by noisy dynamics such as nucleo - some turnover ) . Switching into this latter subpopulation is limited by the lack of a ( VRN5 - dependent ) bias towards the M modification . On return to the warm , however , this limitation is removed : our simula - tions then demonstrate that a transient narrow peakof H3K27me3can indeed cause the epigenetic state of the locus to be efficiently switched . Again , this rise in H3K27me3 levels is predicted to be due to a sub - population of cells with substantial coverage of H3K27me3 across the AU a b c Cold Return to warm Later in warm AA MM AA AA AA Nucleationregion UM AA MM MM MM UM MM MU Nucleationregion MM MA Cell with FLC predominantly covered by A modifications Cell with FLC predominantly covered by M modifications Histone modified with A ( promotes reactions towards A modification on other histones ) Change in histone modification ( reactions towards M ( A ) modification occur with probability proportional to number of histones with M ( A ) modification ) Nucleation of M modification ( dependent on length of cold ) Histone modified with M ( promotes reactions towards M modification on other histones ) Unmodified histone A U M Most cells initially in state with high A coverage across FLC .

Simulated population - averaged levels of the M modification from our fitted simulations are found to be approximately stable up to 30 days after the cold ( Fig . 3 ) , with a population - level change of less than about 10 % from 7 days after the cold , in accordance with the stable long - term silencing observed experimentally . Simulated FLC expres - sion levels 7 days after the cold also show a robust reduction from non - vernalized levels , a reduction whose magnitude increases with increasing length of cold ( Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . However , with our fittedparameters , thesimulatedreductionisnotaslargeasseenexperi - mentally . The model therefore indicates that additional factors could reinforcerepression of FLC , consistentwitha rolefor theDNA - binding protein VRN1 ( ref . 23 ) . According to the model , quantitative silencing on return to the warm is achieved through the fraction of cells that switch to the silenced state , a fraction that increases with increasing length of cold . Althoughtheactiveorsilencedepigeneticstatesare stable , a nucleating peak gives rise to a small probability per unit time of switching . This switching is generated by the noisy histone modification dynamics , which are able to amplify the signal from the nucleating peak of H3K27me3 and use a rare fluctuation to flip the epigenetic state of the system . The timescale of a switch at an individual locus from predominant A to M coverage is predicted to be very rapid ( about 45min , see Supplementary Fig . 6 ) . To test the model prediction of bistable FLC expression , we assayed expression of an FLC : GUS translational fusion 24 , 25 in tissue exposed to different cold treatments . For ease of imaging we analysed root tissue , in which cold - induced epigenetic silencing of FLC occurs , and which can regenerate into plants that have ‘remembered’ the cold exposure 26 . The results are shown in Fig . 4a and Supplementary Fig . 8 , and show that without cold the gene is evenly expressed in the dividing cells of the root tissue . This expression is reduced in all cells after 2 weeks of cold , supporting the fast reduction in FLC transcription seen previ - ously 27 . However , onreturntothewarm , theexpressionreactivatesina proportion of cells , in a cell - autonomous manner . These cells reflect the proportion of the population where the epigenetic switch to the silent state has not occurred . This heterogeneity in silencing would explainthefloweringvariationinregenerants frompartiallyvernalized plants 28 . The proportion of cells reactivating FLC expression reduces with increasing time in the prior cold ( Fig . 4a ) , fully supporting the model predictions . The diversity of sector patterns reflects the stoch - astic nature of the silencing process : both single cells and clusters of FLC : GUS - expressing cells are observed , the latter probably reflecting clones from a single reactivating cell ( Supplementary Fig . 8 ) . The modelling also predicted that population - averaged levels of H3K27me3 could rise rapidly ( within 1 – 2 days ) after return to the warm ( Fig . 4b ) .

Toexperimentallytestthepredictionofa rapid rise at population level , we performed additional higher time resolution ( daily ) ChIP experiments for the week immediately follow - ing the cold ( Fig . 4c and Supplementary Fig . 9 ) . In accordance with model predictions , we found a rapid rise of population - averaged H3K27me3 levels , with the H3K27me3 profile increasing mostly between 1 and 3 days after the cold . Our combined experimental / modelling approach to vernalization has revealed that the quantitative level of epigenetic silencing in the warm is generated by an appropriate proportion of cells switching into a stable FLC - silenced state . Controlled switching of individual cells between bistable states , mediated by nucleation of an opposing histone mark may therefore be a common method of achieving a quantitative epigenetic response at a population level .

Expression analysis . cDNAwassynthesizedusingSuperScriptIII ( Invitrogen ) witha mixtureofoligod ( T ) andgene - specificprimer ( FLC _ unspliced _ R5 9 - ctttgtaatcaaaggtg gagagc - 3 9 ) , and analysed by qPCR on a LightCycler 480 II instrument ( Roche ) , using LightCycler480SYBRGreenmix ( Roche ) . FLC senseunspliced ( unsplicedintron2 / 3 , FLC _ unspliced _ F 5 9 - cgcaattttcatagcccttg - 3 9 , FLC _ unspliced _ R ) quantification was normalized against the Arabidopsis UBC gene ( At 5g25760 , UBC _ F 5 9 - ctgcgactcagg gaatcttctaa - 3 9 , UBC _ R5 9 - ttgtgccattgaattgaaccc - 3 9 ) . FLC : GUSassay . The FLC - Col : GUS in L er FRI was described previously 25 . The FLC - Col : GUS translational fusion contains the b - glucuronidase coding sequences clonedintotheNhelsitewithin ColFLC exon6 ( ref . 24 ) . GUSstainingwascarried out by 4 . 5h incubation at 37 u C in X - Gluc staining solution ( 0 . 5mgml 2 1 X - Gluc , 2 . 0mM K 3 Fe ( CN ) 6 , 2 . 0mM K 4 Fe ( CN ) 6 , 100mM phosphate buffer pH 7 . 0 , 0 . 1 % [ v : v ] Triton X - 100 , 10 mM EDTA ) . Seedlings were vacuum infiltrated for 5min before incubation . After staining , seedlings were cleared in 75 % ( v : v ) ethanol and then 8 : 1 : 3 ( w : w : w ) chloral hydrate : glycerol : water . Roots were imaged using DIC opticsona Leica DM6000microscope witha Leica DFC420camera controlledvia LeicaLASAF7000software . Photoshopadjustment involved onlyimageexposure using adjustment levels .
