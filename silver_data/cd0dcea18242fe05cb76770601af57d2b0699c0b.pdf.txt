We developed hydrophobic mechanosensing fluorescent probes called Flippers , which fluorescence lifetime depends on lipid packing and can report membrane tension . We describe here technical optimization of the probe imaging , and diverse characterizations in various biological and in vitro systems . We propose to the cell biology community a guideline to measure biophysical parameters of cellular membranes by FLIM microscopy with Flipper probes . i Introduction 1 Measuring physical forces in biological material is of increasing interest , but remains 2 technically challenging 1 . The possibility of measuring such forces through microscopy imaging 3 presents the advantages of being less intrusive than many mechanical methods , makes use of 4 the universally available microscopy equipment in research labs . Many fluorescence tools have 5 been developed in this regard , in particular Forster Resonance Energy Transfer ( FRET ) 6 biosensors , in which the elongation of a linker between two FRET fluorophores under force 7 reduces FRET efficiency . The FRET couple and the linker can be composed of fluorescent 8 proteins connected by a peptide chain , all being easily expressed in cells using standard 9 molecular biology techniques . This has been developed to measure forces at focal adhesions , 10 and have been extended to measure force between membranes and actin 2 , the cytoskeleton and 11 the nucleoskeleton 3 or under shear stress 4 . However , these biosensors have several limitations , 12 . CC - BY - NC - ND 4 . 0 International license perpetuity .

Also , it requires the force sensor to be bound to proteins " handles " onto 14 which the force is applied and finding the right combination of interacting domains that will 15 not detach under force remains challenging . 16 Another strategy has been to design small chemicals whose fluorescence properties will change 17 under force variation . For example , molecular rotors based on Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging 18 Microscopy ( FLIM ) were designed to measure viscosity in membranes 5 , 6 . One of the 19 challenges has been to expand the list of forces that can be measured , as some of the forces are 20 exerted within materials , and not between materials . We have designed , synthesized and 21 characterized small - molecules called FLIPPERS that can report changes of membrane lateral 22 forces due to lipid packing variations through changes of their conformation and hence of their 23 fluorescence properties 7 . The high sensitivity of Flippers allows them to report membrane 24 tension variations by changes of the lifetime of their excited state or fluorescence lifetime 8 , 25 upon osmotic shocks 9 , 10 or to investigate lysosomal exocytosis 11 . Over the past 6 years , we 26 designed various derivatives targeting different organelles 12 ( plasma membrane , endoplasmic 27 reticulum , mitochondria and lysosome / late endosome ) . We also developed probes with 28 different biochemical and / or photochemical properties 6 ( HaloFlipper , HaloPhotoFlipper , 29 HydroFlipper ) . We identified fluorescence lifetime imaging ( FLIM ) as the best way to report 30 the conformational changes of Flipper probes with lipid packing . However , measuring 31 membrane tension using FLIM of Flippers remains technically challenging . This method paper 32 aims at bringing technical and practical information to make the use of Flipper probes for 33 membrane tension measurements more accessible . 34 35 I - Basics of Flipper probes 36 Four commercialized Flipper probes with identical mechano - chemistry principle target 37 different membranes in cells : Flipper - TR for plasma membrane , ER Flipper - TR for 38 endoplasmic reticulum , Lyso Flipper - TR for late endo / lysosomes and Mito Flipper - TR for 39 mitochondria . The common chemical structure of Flipper probes ( see Fig 1a ) is composed of 40 two dithienothiophenes ( DTT ) fluorescent groups that can rotate around the carbon bond that 41 links them together . Methyl groups have been added at specific places to ensure that the two 42 DTT groups are twisted out of co - planarity in the ground state , but can still be planarized under 43 application of orthogonal forces . Thus , Flippers have been designed as molecular sensors for 44 compressive forces . 45 . CC - BY - NC - ND 4 . 0 International license perpetuity .

When inserted , the 47 hydrophobic forces that pack the lipids into a bilayer exert pressure onto the Flipper 48 fluorophore and planarize it . Its planarization depends on the lipid composition , and in short , 49 more ordered membranes exert more force and provide more planarization of Flippers and 50 reversely , disordered membrane , less force and planarization . 51 The conformation ( i . e . how much the Flipper molecule is planarized versus twisted ) of the 52 Flipper affects several parameters of the photophysics of the molecule : in the planarized state , 53 the photon emission efficiency is increased by 10x compared to the most twisted state , and the 54 peak of photon absorption is shifted towards larger wavelength , while the change is minimal 55 for the emission peak 13 . 56 - In particular , we noted that the lifetime of Flipper dramatically varied with lipid composition . 57 The lifetime ( Tau1 or the longest decay of a bi - exponential fit ) in the twisted state , equivalent 58 to highly disordered lipid membranes , was as small as 2 . 3 ns , while it could reach values as 59 high as 7ns in highly ordered membranes , where the molecule is fully planarized . This large 60 range of lifetime values is due to the fact that in the planarized state , fluorescence of the two 61 fluorophores is coupled through an electron transfer from the donor group to the acceptor 62 group 6 , which delays emission of the photons , giving longer lifetimes . 63 - The range of lifetime values that this probe could cover was impressively large compared to 64 other probes . For comparison , the lifetime of the Green Fluorescent Protein hardly varies 65 around 2 ns 14 . We thus imagined that the Flippers are so sensitive that they could report tiny 66 changes of the hydrophobic pressure linked to changes of membrane tension . Flipper is thus 67 complementary to Laurdan , an organic fluorescent maker which allows by measuring its 68 anisotropy to detect changes in plasma membrane fluidity . Since Flippers lifetime changes with 69 both the lipid composition and membrane tension , changes of the lifetime can be directly 70 associated with a change in membrane tension , only in cases where lipid composition is not 71 changing . While this condition is always met in vitro , in cells , we usually consider that any 72 variation of lifetime on the second timescale is related to membrane tension , as lipid 73 composition hardly changes over this timescale . For longer timescales ( minute , hour ) , 74 appropriate controls that the lipid composition is not dramatically changing are required . 75 76 .

When the Flipper probe diffuses within lipid membranes , it inserts vertically 79 between lipids and fluoresces . Thus , Flipper probes are " fluorogenic " , becoming fluorescent 80 only when inserted in the structure they target . We describe staining procedures , problems and 81 solutions below . 82 83 A - Staining of cultured cells 84 85 To label most of the cell lines tested ( Fig 2a ) , the probe , solubilized in DiMethylSulfOxide 86 ( DMSO ) , was normally directly added to the imaging medium at 1 uM final concentration and 87 incubated 15 min at 37°C with cells . To keep a low concentration of DMSO in the final 88 medium , 1 mM stock solutions of Flipper probes were usually made . In some cell types 89 ( MDCK , HeLa Kyoto and MZ ) , 5 min of Flipper incubation at 37°C might be enough to obtain 90 good staining . However , at high cell density or in 3D cell cultures and tissues , longer incubation 91 - in the order of a few hours - may be necessary . Imaging medium ( Fluorobrite with Hepes or 92 CO2 supply , or Leibovitz if no CO2 supply is available ) was usually used and gave a good 93 signal over noise ratio . The use of Foetal Bovine Serum ( FBS ) during staining and imaging can 94 cause a lower signal , as it contains proteins which can extract hydrophobic molecules from 95 membranes such as Albumin . However , we haven’t observed a dramatic change of labelling 96 efficiency using solutions described above supplemented with FBS . If the staining appears to 97 be low with FBS , we nevertheless recommend testing solutions without it . We didn’t observe 98 drastic differences on the fluorescence intensity and lifetime of the probe between cells imaged 99 at 37°C and the ones imaged at room temperature . Similarly , CO 2 adjunction in the imaging 100 chamber or working with a medium supplemented with HEPES does not significantly impact 101 Flipper fluorescence intensity or lifetime . 102 103 Importantly , the cell labelling occurs through a dynamic equilibrium of the probe with the 104 micellar pool in the cell culture medium . Thus , a constant exchange of Flipper - TR between the 105 plasma membrane and the medium occurs . This exchange is rapid for the Flipper - TR because 106 the medium is directly in contact with the plasma membrane labelled by the probe . Using 107 FRAP , we show a faster diffusion time at 37°C = 0 . 133 + / - 0 . 02 um2 / sec ( mobile fraction of 108 76 % + / - 5 ) ( Fig 2b , c ) than at 20°C = 0 . 09 um2 / sec ( Fig 2d ) . As expected , a decrease of plasma 109 . CC - BY - NC - ND 4 . 0 International license perpetuity .

Consequently , for short timescale 116 experiments ( less than 2h ) it is not an issue to leave cells in Flipper medium containing Lyso 117 Flipper - TR . However , loss of the acidity of endosomal compartments after treatments or 118 change in the pH of the medium ( due for example to phototoxicity ) may trigger loss of the 119 Lyso Flipper - TR staining . The best labelling was obtained by incubating Lyso Flipper - TR at 120 1uM in Fluorobrite medium without serum for 20 minutes at 37°C prior to imaging . 121 122 Because of the dynamic exchange of the probe between the membrane and the medium , 123 washing Flipper labelled cells with medium containing FBS or BSA will decrease Flipper - TR 124 staining . Therefore , if washing is absolutely needed , it is recommended to wash with medium 125 without FBS , and / or keeping the concentration of the Flipper constant in the washes , which 126 will limit the decrease of the membrane signal . 127 The dynamic equilibrium is relatively long to reach ( 5 - 10 minutes ) , thus the photon count 128 depends on the time of incubation of cells with the probe , until it reaches a plateau value that 129 depends on your system . Incubations that are too long may lead to Flipper - TR endocytosis and 130 endosomal labelling . The Flipper - TR lifetimes within the endosomes are notably lower than in 131 the plasma membrane ( Fig 2g , h ) , and we have never observed Flipper - TR labelling expanding 132 further away than from the endosomes ( probably even the early endosomes ) . Also , the Flipper - 133 TR endosomal labelling appeared with various times depending on the cell types and 134 experimental conditions . In MDCK , we observed that endocytosis occurred after 12 hours ( Fig 135 2i ) . 136 For long - term imaging experiments ( several hours ) with sufficient time - lapse between images , 137 we recommend performing sample - labelling for each time point : the sample is incubated with 138 Flipper - TR , imaged , and then the probe is washed away using medium with BSA or FBS . Each 139 timepoint requires re - incubation of the probe to prevent Flipper - TR endocytosis . 140 141 . CC - BY - NC - ND 4 . 0 International license perpetuity .

However , to avoid any fluorescence overlap with the probe , 146 which could affect lifetime measurements , blue or far - red fluorescent dyes should be used ( e . g : 147 Organic dyes like Alexa - 405 or Alexa - 647 or Blue fluorescent protein , E2 - Crimson or 148 smURFP for fusion proteins , see Fig 2j ) . Indeed , due to the configuration of the probe ( two 149 heads ) , Flipper - TR has a large spectrum of emission and a large spectrum of absorption . The 150 excitation peak of Flipper is at 485 nm and fluorescence emission is collected using a band 151 pass 600 / 50 emission filter . Therefore , for example in the case of an organelle labelled with 152 Alexa - 405 , excitation of this fluorophore ( peak at 400 nm ) will only weakly excite Flipper - TR , 153 limiting the phototoxicity while the emission of Alexa - 405 ( 400 - 530 nm ) will not go through 154 the FLIM detector and will not interfere with Flipper - TR lifetime measurement . 155 156 C - List of cells and organisms from which we obtained successful staining and 157 imaging using Flipper probes 158 159 List of cell types used with Flipper - TR : HeLa MZ , HeLa Kyoto , MDCK , keratinocyte PW21 , 160 keratinocyte KRAS , hippocampal neurons , MDA , A549 , A596 , RPE1 , MEF with lifetime 161 value ( tau1 ) ranging from 5 ns to 5 . 7 ns ( Fig 2a ) . 162 163 List of cell types used with Lyso - Flipper - TR : HPDE , KP4 , Hela MZ , A431 , 293T , MDA with 164 lifetime value ( tau1 ) ranging from 4 . 4 ns to 5 . 1 ns ( Fig 2g ) . 165 166 List of cell types used with Endo Flipper - TR : HeLa MZ , MDA with lifetime value ( tau1 ) 167 ranging from 4 . 1 ns to 4 . 7 ns ( Fig 2h ) . 168 List of organisms stained with Flipper - TR : alginate capsules containing cells , PDMS tubes 169 with attached cells on the inner surface , Arabidopsis thaliana leaf , Arabidopsis thaliana plant 170 root , , Bacillus Subtilis ( Fig 3i , j ) or mouse embryos 15 . 171 172 List of organisms where Flipper - TR staining does not work : E .

The ER 180 Flipper - TR selectively labels the membranes of endoplasmic reticulum via a pentafluorophenyl 181 group which reacts with cysteine of proteins present on ER outer surface . The average lifetime 182 of ER Flipper - TR is lower ( 3 . 5 ns in HeLa cells ) than Flipper - TR ( 4 . 5 ns in HeLa cells ) in 183 various cell lines . The Mito Flipper - TR selectively labels the membranes of mitochondria via 184 the interaction between the hydrophobic triphenylphosphonium cation with the negatively 185 charged surface and the inside negative potential of the mitochondrial membrane . As observed 186 for ER Flipper - TR , the average lifetime of Mito Flipper - TR is rather low ( around 3 . 2 ns in 187 HeLa cells ) . 188 Lyso Flipper - TR and Endo Flipper TR contain a morpholine headgroup of higher pKa in Endo 189 Flipper - TR compared to Lyso Flipper - TR . This morpholine group is protonated in the acidic 190 environment of endosomes and retained in its membrane . The average lifetime of Lyso Flipper - 191 TR is around 4 ns in HeLa cells . Endo and Lyso Flipper - TR are showing very weak photo 192 toxicity . 193 SR - Flipper is behaving as Flipper - TR ( labelling plasma membrane in cells ) and is reversibely 194 switching from bright - state ketones to dark - state hydrates , hemiacetals , and hemithioacetals 195 both in twisted and planarized state . It is therefore possible to use it for single - molecule 196 localization microscopy and to resolve membranes well below the diffraction limit . The 197 lifetime ( τ1 ) of SR - Flipper is usually slightly lower ( ~ 10 % ) than the lifetime of Flipper - 198 TR . HaloFlippers is based on the combination of the Flipper and a Halo tag to label any 199 membrane of interest by targeting membrane specific protein labelled with a halo tag . Halo 200 PhotoFlippers targets the nuclear membrane and the inner plasma membrane using a 201 photocleavable domain 19 . 202 203 III - Acquisition 204 Flipper probes have long average fluorescence lifetimes , up to 7 ns , which means that photons 205 with lifetime up to 50 ns can be detected . Consequently , FLIM systems with sampling 206 frequencies of 20 MHz have to be used in order to detect all the photons . On PicoQuant systems 207 .

Therefore , 209 the sampling frequency has to be reduced in LEICA systems , using the pulse - picker device 210 ( illuminates one out of 2 or more laser pulses ) , otherwise the lifetime will be underestimated . 211 Because of the the bi - exponential nature of the Flipper decay curve , it is important to record a 212 sufficient number of photons without saturating the detector . We recommend recording a 213 minimum intensity peak of 10 4 photons . 214 215 Another important point is that the phototoxicity during acquisition is lower when the laser 216 pulse frequency is decreased . With standard Time Correlated Single Photon Counting ( TCSPC ) 217 it is very important to have a count rate between 1 and 5 % of the excitation rate ( for 20MHz 218 pulse , average detector count rate shouldn’t exceed 1 mHz ) in order to maintain a low 219 probability of registering more than one photon per excitation cycle ( with the dead time , the 220 system would detect the first photon and miss the second one , called “pile up” effect ) . 221 Other classic confocal microscopy parameters that participate in light acquisition ( pinhole 222 aperture , laser power , pixel binning , scanning speed , size of the ROI , line averaging or 223 summation ) may be used to optimize photon collection . Two technical innovation and process 224 also reduced the phototoxicity : 225 - Using a TCSPC device with reduced dead time ( rapidFLIM from Picoquant , dead 226 time of less than 650 ps compare to 80 ns in normal FLIM ) that allows to detect more than one 227 photon per excitation cycle . It also provides a better temporal resolution ( see below ) and allows 228 to work with higher intensities . Overall , with this new kind of TCSPC much higher detector 229 count rates can be processed while achieving better timing precision and faster acquisition . 230 - Repeating acquisition and summing - up photons from several images will allow to 231 obtain sufficient counts of photons ( minimum peak of 10 4 events ) for a correct fit . For standard 232 cells in culture , we used the following conditions . For example , using Flipper - TR in HeLa 233 Kyoto , we could sum up to 7 frames in a 256x256 pixel resolution to reach 10 5 photons peak 234 which was necessary for fitting procedure and lifetime extraction . Cell type and signal intensity 235 determine the optimal acquisition parameters . It is necessary to find a reasonable balance 236 between photon number and phototoxicity and we created a troubleshooting table based on our 237 experience ( Fig 4 ) . 238 .

If medium is added ( osmotic shocks or drug addition ) , we 242 advise to keep Flipper - TR concentration constant . If medium is flowed ( to test the effect of 243 shear stress for example ) it is essential to keep the Flipper - TR concentration constant . Because 244 lifetime values are broad due to inherent biological variability and impacted by cell density or 245 cell type , we suggest assessing both lifetime variation and absolute lifetime values . 246 247 Combining Flipper probes with drug treatment 248 To measure the effect of a drug treatment on cells , we tested two strategies . ( 1 ) Imaging the 249 cells , adding the drug in the medium of a dish or replacing the medium with the one that 250 contains the drug using a microfluidic device and following the effect of the drug over time on 251 the same cells . This approach allows to eliminate the biological variability by measuring the 252 tension of the same cells before and after the treatment . ( 2 ) Imaging the control condition and 253 the treated condition independently ( preferably acquire a large amount of cells to increase 254 statistics as it will be unpaired measurements , typically at least 15 fields of view per dish and 255 3 technical replicates ) . The treated cells must be imaged in the same conditions and on the same 256 day . Because steady state lifetime value can be variable ( it depends on cell density ) , the control 257 condition must be repeated along every drug condition with the same seeding parameters . We 258 suggest following strategy ( 1 ) whenever possible . Classical solvents ( DMSO ) or antibiotics 259 used in inducible systems ( doxycyclin ) change the property of the membrane and therefore 260 affect the Flipper - TR lifetime . Indeed , DMSO increases solution hypertonicity while 261 doxycyclin affects cholesterol amounts . 262 263 Acquiring lifetime in a z - stack ( such as in polarized tissue ) 264 We observed a weak staining in very dense and polarized tissue independently of the incubation 265 time ( from 5 min to 2h ) . Tissues are not perfectly flat leading to smaller collection of photons 266 at the apical side , which might lead to inhomogeneous signal and thus poorly reproducible 267 results . To compare lifetime of the Flipper - TR along Z - axis , samples and conditions , we 268 suggest defining the basal or mid - plane as the plane with the largest number of photons . Due 269 to the inherent difficulty to measure the lifetime of single cells , we advise to compare planes 270 containing several cells . 271 .

Open source and user friendly tools have been and are being developed 20 , 21 . 279 280 B - IRF ( instrument response function ) 281 282 In order to fit the signal , the contribution of instrumentation must be isolated . The overall 283 timing precision of a complete TCSPC system is its Instrument Response Function ( IRF ) . The 284 best way to measure the IRF of the system is to use a fluorophore with similar fluorescence 285 properties as the Flipper - TR but with a very short lifetime . The IRF can be measured using 286 fluorescein solution quenched with potassium iodide before each experiment , or can be 287 calculated ( deducted ) from the rising edge of the TCSPC histogram . The important point is to 288 use the same IRF throughout the experiment . Software used to analyse FLIM images usually 289 recalculate the IRF for each file by default . 290 291 C - Photon count fitting 292 293 Two different methods to fit the exponential decay exist : exponential reconvolution and 294 exponential tailfit . A tailfit can be used when the lifetimes are significantly longer than the IRF . 295 In general , a reconvolution fit is preferable , because the complete decay is fitted , while the start 296 of the fitting range is slightly arbitrary for a tailfit . Depending on the format of the data and the 297 available tools , choosing one or the other shouldn’t impact measurements too much if enough 298 photons are acquired . Tens of thousands of photons are required to accurately fit a bi - 299 exponential decay 22 . In general , lifetime histograms of Flippers are not well fitted by a mono - 300 exponential model , so it is standard to fit the data with double exponentials . 301 The exponential fitting can be done on a different set of pixels . The choice depends on the 302 quality of your signal and the sensitivity of the effect you are looking at . ( 1 ) Whole photons 303 analysis is the simplest and necessitate little requirement of input from the experimentalist , 304 therefore increasing the reproducibility of the work . ( 2 ) It is possible in order to remove the 305 . CC - BY - NC - ND 4 . 0 International license perpetuity .

It is 306 however invalid to apply a threshold based on thelifetime values to extract lifetime . ( 2’ ) 307 Applying a threshold on the absolute lifetime value can be valid to create masks and separate 308 objects with different Flipper lifetimes . For example , the lifetime of the plasma membrane is 309 much higher than the lifetime of endosomal membrane , so a single FLIM image could be 310 sufficient to discriminate the two objects . ( 3 ) Similar to ( 2 ) , it is possible to overlap a mask 311 generated from another channel to only select pixels of interest ( Fig 5a - b ) . 312 Depending on the orientation of the cells in the beam , the number of photons can change . A 313 side acquisition will give a lower number of photons than an acquisition from the bottom , 314 leading to a worst fit ( Fig 5c - e ) . 315 By fitting with a bi - exponential decay , two lifetimes will be extracted : t 1 and t 2 . t AVG is an 316 average between the 2 rates t 1 and t 2 weighted by the number of photons fitted by each 317 parameter . t 1 ( the longest component ) or t AVG will usually represent much higher photon 318 counts than t 2 . Both t 1 or t AVG will directly report the mechanical property of the probe so you 319 should anyway take either t AVG or the longest t ( t 1 on picoquant system ) value to analyse 320 tension fluctuations . In experiments analyzing the dynamics of Flipper , if the tendency of t 1 321 and t AVG is different then it is probably due to a lack of photons for the fit and image acquisition 322 must be optimized . 323 324 D - Image segmentation to extract Flipper lifetime 325 326 Here , we will develop two examples to illustrate the importance of extracting the lifetime 327 properly . Fluorescence intensity images of a membrane probe ( blue or far red CellMask for 328 instance ) can be used to generate a mask that permits to extract lifetime of all the pixels present 329 in the mask ( Fig 5a ) . Even if the lifetime of the internalized probe is lower than the lifetime of 330 the probe at the plasma membrane , applying a threshold based on lifetime value will introduce 331 a bias in the analysis of the overall lifetime . Considering only pixels corresponding to the 332 plasma membrane instead of all the pixels of the image , which include signal coming from 333 endosomes , gives a difference of 0 . 5 ns on average ( Fig 5b ) . 334 The second example is illustrated by measuring the impact of blebbistatin ( myosin inhibitor 335 reducing cell contractility ) on plasma membrane tension reported by Flipper - TR lifetime ( Fig 336 5f ) . If all the pixels of the images ( control versus blebbistatin - treated cells ) are included for the 337 fitting , a decrease of lifetime of 0 . 3 ns is observed ( Fig 5g ) . However , it appears that on images 338 . CC - BY - NC - ND 4 . 0 International license perpetuity .

These pixels likely 340 contribute to the overall lower lifetime measured for Blebbistatin - treated cells . By contrast , if 341 only plasma membrane lifetime is measured , the average lifetime of Blebbistatin - treated cells 342 is 0 . 1 ns higher than the average lifetime of control cells . Directly selecting the plasma 343 membrane pixels also excludes the background , which could affect the analysis . 344 345 346 E - Comparing different areas within the same image 347 348 The goal of the experiments might be to compare regions within the same image . As explained , 349 a minimum number of photons will be necessary to obtain a decent fit and to extract the lifetime 350 properly . Therefore , we strongly suggest to check that the photon count is similar between 351 different analyzed area . 352 IV - Results 353 354 A - Different lifetime along cell height 355 356 By imaging Flipper - TR over z - stacks of MDCK polarized tissues , we observed a lower lifetime 357 ( 4 . 6 ns ) at the basal plane of the cell compared to the apical plane ( 5 . 4 ns ) , as illustrated in Fig 358 6a . Also , large variability exists between position in the dish : the basal plane lifetime values 359 vary from 4 . 2 ns to 5 . 1 ns , while the apical plane values vary between 4 . 3 ns and 5 . 6 ns . 360 However , the lifetime difference between basal and apical planes is always the same ( Fig 6b ) 361 which could be explained by different lipid compositions . Therefore , single plane imaging of 362 cells to compare , for example , different treatments , must be performed at a similar height ( Fig 363 6c ) , and sufficient statistics to account for large biological differences between single cells are 364 required . 365 366 B - Mitotic cells have a more disordered plasma membrane 367 368 We analyzed the Flipper - TR lifetime in mitotic cells which are known to have a higher volume , 369 higher cortical tension and a very different shape than adherent cells 23 – 25 . Mitotic cells were 370 identified by eye based on their rounded shape and their limited attached surface to the glass 371 bottom . In contrast to the literature , mitotic cells have a 0 . 35 ns lower lifetime ( Fig 6d ) 372 . CC - BY - NC - ND 4 . 0 International license perpetuity .

This lower lifetime could reflect a change of lipid composition during cell division , 374 itself causing increased membrane fluidity in mitotic cells 26 . 375 376 C - Flipper - TR variability depends on cell confluency 377 378 We analyzed the Flipper - TR lifetime depending on cell confluency . Using RPE1 , we observed 379 that confluent cells have a Flipper - TR lifetime centered around 5 . 5 + / - 0 . 06 ns while non - 380 confluent cell lifetime is centered around 5 . 4 + / - 0 . 23 ns ( Fig . 6e ) . Therefore , in case of 381 experiments performed using cells at low confluency , sufficient statistics are required to 382 account for large biological differences between single cells . 383 384 D - Distinguishing the contributions of lipid composition and tension to the 385 changes of lifetime 386 387 Previous work from the lab 8 showed that mechanical increase of Giant Unilamellar Vesicles 388 ( GUVs ) membrane tension induced by micropipette aspiration ( high tension ) leads to an 389 increase of 0 . 2 ns of Flipper - TR lifetime . Using the same setup to aspirate HeLa cells in 390 suspension ( Fig 6f , an increase of 0 . 2 ns was also observed ( Fig 6g ) , confirming that in both 391 GUVs and cells Flipper - TR lifetime measurements can directly report a mechanically induced 392 change of membrane tension . 393 Although being slightly lower than Flipper ( steady state lifetime of 5 ns vs 5 . 8 ns for SM / Chol 394 GUV ) , the lifetime of super - resolution ( SR ) - Flipper also reports changes in membrane tension 395 of GUVs ( Fig 7a - b ) as well as change in lipid packing ( composition ) . Indeed , SR - Flipper - TR 396 lifetime of SM / Chol ( 70 / 30 ) GUV is centred around 5 ns while the lifetime of DOPC / Chol 397 ( 70 / 30 ) GUV is centred around 4 . 2 ns ( Fig 7b ) . With both lipid compositions , SR - Flipper 398 lifetime decreases upon membrane tension decrease induced by hypertonic shocks proving that 399 Flipper probes lifetime report both lipid composition and membrane tension ( Fig 7a - e ) . In 400 contrast , the lifetime of pure DOPC GUVs is not changing after hypertonic shock which is in 401 good agreement with an absence of phase separation ( Fig 7a , f ) . 402 NNiemann - Pick C1 protein ( NPC1 ) is responsible of the intracellular transport of Cholesterol 403 and shingolipids . Consequently , the depletion of NPC1 is responsible for cholesterol 404 accumulation in endosomes . Consistently , LysoFlipper in HeLa MZ NPC1 KO cells have a 405 higher lifetime than in WT HeLa cells indicating higher lipid packing ( Fig 7g - h ) . Nonetheless , 406 .

Interestingly , this absence of caveolae is associated with a smaller Flipper - TR 410 lifetime , indicating either a lower membrane tension or a more disordered membrane 411 composition ( Fig 7j - k ) . Cavin1 - KO cells show a lifetime increase upon hypotonic shocks ( Fig 412 7j , i ) . Despite a potential difference of lipid composition , Flipper - TR is anyway able to report 413 an increase of membrane tension . 414 415 Conclusion : 416 Here , we have reported the current technical difficulties we faced using Flipper probes , and 417 how we overcame them . In the future , further developments of Flipper probes will allow us to 418 bypass some of these problems . Technical improvements in the FLIM image acquisition and 419 analysis may also help spread the use of Flipper probes to all biological samples of interest . 420 Flipper probes remain an interesting tool for many applications , and in some cases , the only 421 available tool to measure membrane tension . 422 .
