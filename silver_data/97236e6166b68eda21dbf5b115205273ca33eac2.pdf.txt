One of the most important of these is calcium , and over the past few years many new insights have been gained into the role of calcium in axon guidance . In this review we focus on mechanisms of calcium entry into the growth cone and its downstream effects on both growth cone motility and turning . We particularly highlight the role of calcium concentrations in determining attractive versus repulsive responses to graded guidance cues , and their role in guidance by the morphogen Wnt5a . Introduction For the brain to be wired correctly during development axons must navigate appropriately to their targets , often over long distances . Axons achieve this feat by detecting and responding appropriately to numerous molecular and physical guidance cues in their local environment , usually via the growth cone [ 1 ] . This includes guidance by growth through permissive conduits , by substrate - bound guidance cues , or by gradients of diffusible cues . Several molecular guidance cue families involved in axon guidance have been identiﬁed including the netrins , semaphorins , ephrins , slits , neurotrophins , Wnts , and some morphogens [ 2 , 3 ] . These cues are detected by receptors on the axon surface , which then activate a variety of downstream signaling pathways to cause axon turning and / or changes in growth rate [ 4 ] . One of the most crucial components of these pathways is calcium [ 5 – 8 ] . Calcium concentrations in growth cones are regulated both by calcium inﬂux through the plasma mem - brane and by release from intracellular calcium stores [ 9 , 10 ] ( see Glossary ) . A calmodulin - dependent protein kinase II ( CaMKII ) – calcineurin ( CaN ) switch often initiates either an attractive ( turning towards the highest guidance cue con - centration ) or repulsive ( turning away from the highest guidance cue concentration ) response to these intracellular calcium elevations [ 8 ] . These responses are effected via the regulation of cytoskeletal components , such as microtubules and actin ﬁlaments [ 11 – 15 ] , and by membrane dynamics , including vesicle trafﬁcking [ 16 – 18 ] . In the past few years many new insights have emerged regarding the central and multifaceted roles of calcium in mediating axon growth and guidance . We review here some of these developments , focusing particularly on new mechanisms for producing and mediating calcium elevations , the involvement of calci - um in the attraction / repulsion switch , how calcium modu - lates growth cone motility , and the role of calcium in guidance by Wnt5a . Mechanisms of calcium entry The spatial distribution and level of intracellular calcium is crucial for axon guidance [ 19 ] , and regulation of this distribution begins with calcium entry into the growth cone . Methods of entry particularly important for axon guidance include voltage - dependent calcium channels ( VDCCs ) , release of intracellular calcium stores , and store - operated calcium entry ( SOCE ) from extracellular sources ( Figure 1 ) . The most important VDCCs for growth cone turning are the L - type Ca 2 + channels [ 20 , 21 ] . Inhibi - tion of these channels switches turning in response to netrin - 1 , an attractive chemotropic factor , to repulsion Review Glossary Axon guidance by growth rate modulation : a type of chemotactic movement whereby axon guidance up the gradient is mediated not by turning , but instead by the axon taking larger steps when it is pointed up the gradient than when it is pointed down the gradient ; [ 67 ] for more details . Calcium - induced calcium release ( CICR ) : the release of calcium from intracel - lular stores in response to rising calcium concentration ( i . e . , a positive feedback process ) .

Activity of L - type Ca 2 + channels is precisely regulated by cAMP ( activation ) and cGMP ( inactivation ) : usually high levels of cGMP promote repulsion in response to netrin - 1 whereas high levels of cAMP promote attraction [ 21 ] . Thus , L - type Ca 2 + channels are essential for growth cone attraction to a netrin - 1 source , with cAMP and cGMP allowing control and modulation of activity . There are two main mechanisms for triggering release of calcium from intracellular stores : inositol trisphosphate ( IP 3 ) - induced Ca 2 + release ( IICR ) [ 22 ] and Ca 2 + - induced Ca 2 + release ( CICR ) [ 23 ] . In response to a chemotropic factor such as netrin - 1 , brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) , or nerve growth factor ( NGF ) , phospholipase C ( PLC ) is activated [ 24 , 25 ] , which hydrolyzes phosphatidy - linositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PIP 2 ) into IP 3 and diacylgly - cerol . Once created , IP 3 selectively binds to IP 3 receptors ( IP 3 Rs ) located on the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) , initiating IICR [ 26 ] . This process is likely mediated by both protein kinase A ( PKA ) [ 22 ] and Homer1 [ 23 , 27 ] . Besides its necessity for growth cone turning , artiﬁcially induced IICR is also sufﬁcient for turning [ 22 ] . Gradients of NGF produce asymmetric IP 3 signals in a PLC - dependent manner , which then produce asymmetric Ca 2 + elevations intracellularly [ 22 ] . The concentration of both IP 3 and Ca 2 + are both higher on the side of the growth cone closest to the NGF source [ 22 ] , consistent with responses to other guid - ance cues [ 28 ] . Inhibition of PLC , or treatment with thap - sigargin ( which empties intracellular Ca 2 + stores ) , inhibits NGF - induced attraction , conﬁrming the PLC - dependence and intracellular source of IICR [ 22 ] . To demonstrate sufﬁciency of asymmetric IP 3 signals to generate turning , Akiyama et al . [ 22 ] photolytically released IP 3 on one side of the growth cone . This generated matching asymmetric IP 3 and Ca 2 + distributions and turning towards the side of the growth cone with the larger intracellular Ca 2 + concen - tration [ 22 ] . IICR is thus a crucial step in attractive axon guidance . CICR from ER internal stores is caused by an initial release of Ca 2 + , often small in magnitude , which binds to ryanodine receptors ( RyR ) to induce release [ 23 , 29 ] . CICR is enhanced by cAMP but inhibited by the cGMP – nitric oxide ( NO ) pathway : increasing the level of intracellular cGMP directly inhibits CICR [ 30 ] . This is sufﬁcient to reverse the effect of attractive guidance cues , indicating the importance of both CICR and the cGMP – NO pathway to growth cone guidance . Both IICR and CICR are depen - dent on Homer1 , a scaffolding protein associated with both RyRs and IP 3 Rs . Homer1 knockdown removes intracellu - lar calcium in response to BDNF and switches attraction in response to BDNF and netrin - 1 to repulsion [ 23 ] . In response to depletion of ER Ca 2 + stores , a ﬁnal mechanism of calcium entry , SOCE , is initiated . When ER stores are depleted , the ER - resident stromal interac - tion molecule 1 ( STIM1 ) localizes to the ER and plasma membrane junctions [ 31 – 33 ] . From here , STIM1 facilitates SOCE [ 34 ] through store - operated calcium ( SOC ) channels which utilize transient receptor potential cation ( TRPC ) channels and ORAI1 , and calcium release - activated calci - um ( CRAC ) channels which depend primarily on ORAI1 [ 33 , 35 – 37 ] . Importantly , STIM1 localization in response to gradients of guidance cues is biased towards the up - gradi - ent side of the growth cone , facilitating propagation of asymmetric Ca 2 + elevations [ 33 ] . Calcium entry through TRPC channels in response to attractive gradients of netrin and BDNF is PIP 3 - depen - dent [ 38 ] . Gradients induce asymmetric PIP 3 levels at the leading edge of the growth cone through activation of phosphoinositide 3 - kinase ( PI3K ) , a kinase which cata - lyzes the production of PIP 3 from PIP 2 [ 38 , 39 ] . PIP 3 pro - duction is necessary for attraction and protein kinase B ( Akt , a downstream kinase ) activation . Perturbation of Akt levels is sufﬁcient to disrupt attraction , indicating that PIP 3 induces guidance via Akt [ 38 ] . External gradients of PIP 3 are sufﬁcient to induce calcium entry through TRPC CICR IICR PLC Ca 2 + Homer ER Store deple ! on STIM1 localiza ! on ER RyR IP 3 Homer IP 3 R SOC CRAC TRPC STIM1 ORAI1 ORAI1STIM1 Complete Ca 2 + eleva ! on Intracellularresponses Plasma membrane Plasma membrane Relevant membrane Plasma membrane Process Ca 2 + inﬂux through VDCCs TRENDS in Neurosciences Figure 1 . Pathways of calcium entry into growth cones and release from intracellular stores . Calcium entry occurs through VDCCs ( in particular L - type calcium channels ) in the cell plasma membrane to activate CICR directly , and indirectly initiate IICR . CICR and IICR are both Homer1 - mediated and release Ca 2 + from the ER . CICR is induced by the binding of incoming Ca 2 + to RyRs on the ER membrane . In the IP 3 pathway , PLC is activated to hydrolyze PIP 2 into IP 3 and diacylglycerol . IP 3 binds to receptors on the surface of the ER , initiating IICR . In response to calcium store depletion , STIM1 becomes localized to the ER and plasma membrane junctions , and leads to SOCE through SOC channels which utilize TRPC and ORAI1 , and CRAC channels which depend mainly on ORAI1 . SOCE facilitates large influxes of Ca 2 + from extracellular sources . The resulting asymmetric intracellular calcium elevation leads to asymmetric intracellular responses creating attraction or repulsion .

Review Trends in Neurosciences August 2014 , Vol . 37 , No . 8 425 channels and attractive turning ( with matching Ca 2 + ele - vations ) , indicating that PIP 3 is involved upstream of Ca 2 + signaling . The method of calcium entry has recently been proposed as indicative of turning . Tojima et al . [ 17 ] found that calcium entry involving CICR and IICR produced an at - tractive response , whereas Ca 2 + signals without store entry invoked a repulsive response [ 17 ] . Furthermore , the method of calcium entry also affects axon outgrowth and growth cone motility [ 40 , 41 ] . Calcium inﬂux through mechanosensitive stretch - activated channels decreases ax - on motility [ 41 ] . By contrast , calcium inﬂux through other avenues ( TRPC channels and intracellular stores ) sup - ports and promotes axon outgrowth [ 41 ] . It is unclear whether these outcomes are speciﬁcally related to the source of Ca 2 + or simply to the resulting elevation – which is known to have narrow ranges which result in attraction [ 42 ] and increased axon outgrowth [ 43 ] . Role of calcium in turning A turning response requires asymmetric deployment of signaling molecules between the two sides of the growth cone . Zheng [ 44 ] used focal laser - induced photolysis ( FLIP ) of caged calcium to generate a spatially restricted elevation of intracellular calcium concentration on one side of the growth cone . This asymmetric calcium elevation is sufﬁ - cient to cause growth cone turning ; however , the direction is dependent on the steepness of the calcium gradient and background calcium concentrations [ 44 ] . Large calcium increases ( steep gradients ) with normal extracellular cal - cium concentrations cause attraction [ 44 ] . Conversely , large intracellular calcium increases in the absence of extracellular calcium , or small intracellular calcium increases ( shallow gradients ) , cause repulsion of the growth cone [ 45 ] . An important function of receptors for chemotactic guid - ance cues , such as BDNF , NGF , netrin - 1 , or myelin - asso - ciated glycoprotein ( MAG ) , is thus to generate asymmetric Ca 2 + elevations across growth cones in response to chemo - tropic gradients [ 46 ] . It is at this stage that different methods of calcium entry into the cytosol are crucial be - cause control of entry mechanisms allows precise modula - tion of calcium elevation magnitude and distribution in response to different guidance cues . This begins a cascade of secondary reactions , some of which serve to amplify the initial elevation through processes including CRAC and CICR . Other responses to the calcium elevation propagate the signal along a pathway beginning with Ca 2 + / calmodu - lin ( CaM ) , and result in either attraction or repulsion of the growth cone along the gradient . Attraction is primarily mediated by CaMKII , whereas repulsion is mediated by CaN in conjunction with protein phosphatase 1 ( PP1 ) [ 45 ] . Other crucial components of this pathway include PKA , exchange protein directly activated by cAMP ( Epac ) , inhib - itor 1 ( I1 ) , and the second messenger cAMP . A recent mathematical model has proposed a mechanism for this molecular switch [ 42 ] , based on a pathway uncovered by Wen et al . [ 45 ] and Han et al . [ 47 ] ( Box 1 and Figure 2 ) . Similar turning mechanisms have been proposed to underlie the response of various other cues , in particular morphogens [ 48 , 49 ] . Under normal conditions bone mor - phogenic protein ( BMP ) 7 activates cytoskeletal compo - nents through LIM kinase ( LIMK ) to induce attractive turning [ 48 ] . However , when TRPC channels are opened , Ca 2 + induces CaN activity which counters the effects of LIMK , converting attraction to repulsion in a Ca 2 + - depen - dent manner [ 48 ] . Downstream effects of calcium Although a molecular switch mediated by CaMKII and CaN likely determines the growth cone response to intra - cellular calcium distributions , it is downstream effectors which induce membrane trafﬁcking and cytoskeletal changes that create this response [ 16 , 17 , 48 ] . Repulsive guidance cues usually induce asymmetric endocytosis [ 17 ] , whereas attractive cues induce asymmetric exocytosis Box 1 . A recently discovered attraction / repulsion switch Recently a mathematical model has been used to describe the attraction / repulsion switch acting within growth cones [ 42 ] . This builds on previous work modeling the switch from long - term potentiation to long - term depression in synaptic plasticity [ 74 ] , which is controlled by a similar pathway [ 44 , 45 , 47 ] . Following Ca 2 + entry in response to a graded guidance cue , the pathway begins with the rapid binding of Ca 2 + to CaM to form a Ca 2 + / CaM complex [ 75 ] . This activates CaN , PKA , and CaMKII at differing levels on each side of the growth cone , depending on the intracellular Ca 2 + concentration . At low levels of Ca 2 + / CaM , CaMKII has low affinity for Ca 2 + / CaM . However , once a critical threshold level is achieved CaMKII affinity for Ca 2 + / CaM increases dramatically [ 76 ] . Meanwhile , CaN has a constant affinity for Ca 2 + / CaM at all Ca 2 + concentrations [ 45 ] . At normal levels of cAMP , CaN activity predominates at low cytosolic Ca 2 + concentrations and CaMKII activity predominates at high concentrations [ 42 ] . CaN promotes repulsion whereas CaMKII promotes attraction , and it is the relative activity of these molecules that is important for growth cone turning . In addition to the bistability of CaMKII , cAMP plays a crucial role in turning [ 77 , 78 ] . Although this role was originally thought to be exclusively PKA - dependent , it has recently been shown to be dependent on Epac , a protein with similar function to PKA [ 78 ] . Murray et al . [ 78 ] have suggested that Epac mediates attraction and PKA mediates repulsion . However , because both PKA and Epac are modulated by cAMP [ 77 , 78 ] the mathematical model [ 42 ] does not distinguish between the effects of these molecules . The final two proteins in the model are I1 and PP1 . PP1 inhibits CaMKII ( thus promoting repulsion ) and is inhibited by I1 [ 47 ] . I1 activity is inhibited by CaN , and promoted by the cAMP / PKA / Epac group . The protein originally thought to activate I1 was PKA [ 47 ] ; however , because the inhibitor used was nonspecific , Epac could possibly perform this function [ 78 ] . The model splits the growth cone into two compartments ( up - gradient and down - gradient ) . In each compartment a set of differ - ential equations representing the pathway described above is considered independently . The output of the model is the CaMKII : CaN ratio in each compartment , and the model hypothesizes that turning will occur towards the side of the compartment with a greater CaMKII : CaN ratio ( Figure 2 ) . Because the relationship between Ca 2 + concentration and CaMKII : - CaN ratio is nonlinear , the model is able to explain some counter - intuitive aspects of how calcium and cAMP levels control attraction versus repulsion [ 79 , 80 ] . In particular , the model explains why the steepness of the Ca 2 + gradient across the growth cone is important , and why an abnormally high or low background Ca 2 + concentration switches the response ( Figure 2 ) . These results suggest that it is the resulting Ca 2 + concentration that is critical rather than the method of calcium entry . Review Trends in Neurosciences August 2014 , Vol . 37 , No . 8 426 [ 50 ] . Notably , these responses are not merely the same response with the sign reversed ; attraction to the left of a growth cone invokes a distinctly different response to repulsion from the right . Growth cones usually respond to chemorepulsion through asymmetric endocytosis on the up - gradient side of the growth cone [ 16 , 17 ] . In response to a repulsive MAG gradient , Xenopus spinal neurons modulate the functional distribution of integrin receptors . Asymmetric b 1 - integrin function is both necessary and sufﬁcient for repulsive turning in response to MAG [ 16 ] . This asymmetry can be created by endocytosis of b 1 - integrin , which is positively Low [ Ca 2 + ] ( C ) ( B ) ( A ) CaM PP1 I1 cAMP / PKA / Epac CaN CaMKII Ca 2 + CaM PP1 I1 cAMP / PKA / Epac CaN CaMKII Ca 2 + Normal [ Ca 2 + ] High [ Ca 2 + ] ( E ) ( D ) Normal [ Ca 2 + ] Repulsion A ! rac " on Outcome [ Ca 2 + ] Repulsion A ! rac " on Outcome [ Ca 2 + ] ( F ) ( G ) ‘Normal’ ‘Normal’ Ca 2 + High cAMP Key : Base cAMP Low cAMP High cAMP Key : Base cAMP Low cAMP TRENDS in Neurosciences Figure 2 . A mathematical model for how calmodulin - dependent protein kinase II ( CaMKII ) and calcineurin ( CaN ) activity modulation determines growth cone attraction versus repulsion to a gradient [ 42 ] . ( A ) The growth cone is imagined to be split into two compartments ( up - gradient to the right , and down - gradient to the left ) . On each side a Ca 2 + - dependent switch [ 47 ] processes Ca 2 + elevations . Calcium binds to CaM to form a calcium / CaM complex which activates CaN , protein kinase A ( PKA ) , and CaMKII . At low concentrations of calcium ( [ Ca 2 + ] ) , CaMKII has low affinity for the calcium / CaM complex , and CaN activity therefore predominates . As the calcium concentration rises above a threshold , the affinity of the calcium / CaM complex for CaMKII increases dramatically , resulting in a higher activity of CaMKII compared to CaN . The model compares the ratios of CaMKII : CaN between the two sides of the growth cone , and hypothesizes that turning occurs to the side with the higher ratio . ( B – E ) Summary of experimental findings regarding how the steepness of the intracellular Ca 2 + gradient interacts with background concentrations of Ca 2 + to determine the direction of turning . ( F ) Predictions of the model for a normally attractive gradient . At normal PKA levels ( black curve ) and normal background Ca 2 + concentrations the ratio of CaMKII : CaN is higher on the up - gradient side ( assumed to have 30 % higher Ca 2 + ) compared to the down - gradient side of the growth cone , and thus the response is attraction . However , in low background Ca 2 + , CaMKII is very low on both sides , whereas CaN is still increasing with Ca 2 + concentration . This causes the ratio of CaMKII : CaN to be higher on the down - gradient ( lower Ca 2 + ) side , leading to repulsion . In high background Ca 2 + the activity of CaMKII is saturated on both sides , and the steady increase of CaN with Ca 2 + concentration means that again the CaMKII : CaN ratio is now higher on the down - gradient side , leading to repulsion . The effect of changing PKA activity is primarily to shift the curve along the Ca 2 + concentration axis . When this shift is large enough it causes both high and low levels of PKA to lead to repulsion . ( G ) Predictions of the model for a normally repulsive gradient . In this case the up - gradient side is assumed to have 10 % higher Ca 2 + . Similar reasoning applies as for the normally attractive gradient discussed above , but the response at normal background Ca 2 + concentration is now repulsion because the 10 % increase is not sufficient to cause a large increase in CaMKII activity between the two sides ; [ 42 ] for more details .

Review Trends in Neurosciences August 2014 , Vol . 37 , No . 8 427 regulated by Ca 2 + . Indeed , inhibition of calcium signaling blocks repulsive turning and asymmetry in b 1 - integrin distributions [ 16 ] . Similar studies using semaphorin ( Sema ) 3A gradients and repulsive Ca 2 + signals have found similar activation of asymmetric endocytosis [ 17 ] and axo - nal transport [ 51 ] , indicating that this is likely to be a conserved method for growth cone repulsion that is not exclusive to MAG . Hines et al . [ 16 ] found that internalization of b 1 - integrin occurs through clathrin - mediated endocytosis , and abol - ishing this process is sufﬁcient to remove turning . Cla - thrin - mediated endocytosis is initiated by asymmetric formation of clathrin coated pits ( the precursor to cla - thrin - mediated endocytosis ) in response to Sema3A gra - dients or repulsive Ca 2 + signals generated using FLIP [ 17 ] . Surprisingly , inhibition of clathrin - mediated endocytosis switches repulsion to attraction but does not affect growth cone attraction [ 17 ] . In contrast to repulsion , attractive signals induce asym - metric exocytosis at the growth cone [ 17 , 39 ] . Tojima et al . [ 18 ] identiﬁed enhanced vesicle - associated membrane pro - tein ( VAMP ) 2 - mediated exocytosis in response to attrac - tive Ca 2 + signals elicited by FLIP of caged Ca 2 + . Furthermore , inhibition of VAMP2 - mediated exocytosis by tetanus neurotoxin ( TeNT ) abolished attraction [ 18 ] . Interestingly , TeNT did not stop axon growth , suggesting that axon outgrowth mediation is independent of VAMP2 and can be regulated distinctly from attraction [ 18 ] . VAMP2 - mediated exocytosis is not only necessary but also is sufﬁcient for attraction [ 17 ] . In addition to VAMP2 - mediated exocytosis , syntaxin - 1 ( Sytx1 ) and tetanus neurotoxin - insensitive ( TI ) - VAMP me - diate netrin - 1 signals ; this complex associates with the netrin - 1 receptor in growth cones , deleted in colorectal cancer ( DCC ) [ 50 ] . Noticeably Sytx1 coassociates TI - VAMP , rather than its more common partner VAMP2 , in response to netrin - 1 signals . This suggests a unique mechanism of exocytosis in netrin - 1 - induced attraction . Sytx1 and TI - VAMP are required for in vitro attraction in response to netrin - 1 whereas VAMP2 inhibition ( via TeNT ) does not affect attraction [ 50 ] . Further , TI - VAMP and Sytx1 are both necessary for in vivo commissural axon pathﬁnding ( an event known to be mediated by netrin - 1 ) [ 50 , 52 ] . Ca 2 + - dependent clustering of b 1 - integrin is essential for growth cone responses to BDNF ( normally an attractive cue ) ( Figure 3 ) [ 40 ] . Bath application of BDNF is sufﬁcient to induce increased b 1 - integrin clustering at the growth cone , especially within ﬁlopodia [ 40 ] . Simultaneous immu - nolabeling of known adhesion components and b 1 - integrin revealed that b 1 - integrin clustering in response to BDNF occurs within nascent adhesion complexes [ 40 ] . Pretreat - ment with BDNF was sufﬁcient to abolish b 1 - integrin internalization in response to MAG . These results are consistent with the hypothesis that growth cone responses are determined by the balance of endocytosis and exocyto - sis : asymmetric exocytosis adds membrane , receptors , and integrins to the attracted side , whereas endocytosis removes membrane , receptors , and integrins from the repulsed side , and thus turning occurs towards the side with higher exocytosis or lower endocytosis . Although PI3K is involved upstream of Ca 2 + activation in response to netrin - 1 and BDNF [ 38 ] , PI3K activation is also required downstream of Ca 2 + to activate microtubule - dependent membrane transport [ 22 , 39 ] . Inhibition of PI3K abolishes attractive turning ( produced by FLIP of Ca 2 + or IP 3 ) and inhibits microtubule advance , while leaving IICR unaffected [ 22 , 39 ] . Furthermore exogenous application of PIP 3 , the product of PI3K catalyzed reaction , promotes microtubule advance [ 39 ] and growth cone turning [ 38 ] .

( A ) Attractive chemotropic cues induce asymmetric exocytosis in the growth cone mediated by vesicle - associated membrane protein 2 ( VAMP2 ) or syntaxin and neurotoxin - insensitive VAMP ( TI - VAMP ) , as well as by b 1 - integrin clustering on the cell plasma membrane on the up - side of the gradient . Increased actin polymerization and branching , as well as increased tubulin polymerization , lead to an asymmetric increase in filopodial and lamellipodial activity on the up - side of the gradient . Ca 2 + functions as a second messenger that directly activates these components . Increased adhesion of the growth cone to the substrate via b 1 - integrin , and addition of new plasma membrane to the up - side of the gradient , leads to turning and increased axon outgrowth in response to gradients of attractive guidance cues such as brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ; green ) . ( B ) By contrast , gradients of repulsive chemotropic cues such as myelin - associated glycoprotein ( MAG ; red ) lead to internalization of b 1 - integrin via clathrin - mediated endocytosis , as well as the asymmetric endocytosis of cell plasma membrane on the up - side of repulsive guidance cue gradients . Loss of b 1 - integrin adhesions and removal of the cell membrane leads to turning of the growth cone away from the gradient . Review Trends in Neurosciences August 2014 , Vol . 37 , No . 8 428 essential in regulating the actin cytoskeleton to cause both attraction and repulsion in BMP7 - dependent turning of growth cones [ 48 ] . Remodeling of the growth cone cytoskeleton is mediated by a host of intermediary molecules . The most prominent of these are members of the small Rho GTPase family , in - cluding RhoA , Ras - related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 ( Rac1 ) , and cell division control protein 42 homolog ( Cdc42 ) , which have major roles in regulating actin and microtubule stability [ 53 , 54 ] . Elevation of cytoplasmic Ca 2 + from intracellular stores can elevate Cdc42 and Rac1 , but downregulates RhoA [ 14 ] through GTPase - acti - vating proteins and guanine nucleotide exchange factors [ 55 ] . Rho GTPases are also activated by protein kinase C and CaMKII [ 56 ] which are both activated by Ca 2 + . Ca 2 + inﬂux leads to activation of Cdc42 through platelet - acti - vating factor acetyl - hydrolase IB subunit a ( formerly known as Lis1 ) to regulate the cytoskeleton at the leading edge of moving neurons and growth cones by linking microtubule ends to actin [ 57 ] . The Rho GTPases are also themselves regulators of Ca 2 + . RhoA regulates Ca 2 + directly and is required for hematopoietic progenitor migration [ 58 ] whereas Rac1 modulates Ca 2 + release in growth cones by enhancing microtubule assembly , which promotes Ca 2 + release from the ER [ 59 ] . These results suggest how asymmetric calci - um distributions caused by external guidance cues could lead to asymmetric cytoskeletal remodeling and thus growth cone turning . Calcium , motility , and growth rate The role of calcium signaling in overall growth cone motili - ty is less well understood than its role in turning . Calcium signaling has an effect on the growth rate of growth cones , ﬁrst characterized as a narrow extracellular calcium con - centration range favorable for growth [ 43 , 60 – 62 ] . Surpris - ingly , calcium transients [ 63 , 64 ] and calcium entry through mechanosensitive channels slow axon growth , whereas calcium release from ER stores enhances growth [ 41 ] . The relation between calcium transients and cAMP signaling may be different between the central domain of the growth cone and its ﬁlopodia [ 19 ] . Further , manipulat - ing growth cone calcium waves is sufﬁcient to affect neurite extension directly [ 65 ] . High - frequency ﬁlopodial calcium transients can reduce growth cone motility and outgrowth by reducing ﬁlopodial motility [ 5 ] . Filopodial transients can also be propagated to the rest of the growth cone , initiating global growth cone calcium elevations . Importantly , local transients are not always propagated throughout the axon : local calcium transients can produce differential outgrowth and exten - sion in axons and their branches [ 66 ] . Creation of asym - metric calcium transients , by use of multiple different substrates , is sufﬁcient to induce growth cone turning [ 5 ] . This suggests that motility changes caused by Ca 2 + transients and growth cone turning could share common calcium entry and response mechanisms . It has been suggested that , in shallow gradients , axon guidance occurs primarily by growth rate modulation rath - er than via growth cone turning [ 67 ] . That is , changes in the direction of axon growth are random , but axons move faster when they are directed up the gradient than when they are directed down the gradient . Thompson et al . ( 2011 ) found that reducing cAMP levels did not convert attraction by growth rate modulation into repulsion , and therefore suggested that this guidance mechanism is con - trolled by distinct intracellular signaling processes from turning responses [ 68 ] . However , the role of calcium in axon guidance by growth rate modulation is unknown . One way in which calcium signaling is involved in growth cone motility is through BDNF - induced axon out - growth . Carlstrom et al . [ 40 ] found that BDNF - induced cytoplasmic calcium signaling leads to remodeling of adhe - sions containing b 1 - integrin onto growth cones and results in extension of the axon . Treatment with either a calcium chelator or a non - selective membrane calcium channel blocker is sufﬁcient to block both b 1 - integrin clustering and the increased axon outgrowth resulting from BDNF application , indicating that Ca 2 + inﬂux from extracellular sources is necessary for BDNF - induced axon outgrowth [ 40 ] . Furthermore , MAG ( normally a repulsive guidance cue ) exhibited the opposite effect to BDNF , reducing both b 1 - integrin clustering and axonal extension , in a calcium - dependent manner [ 16 , 40 ] . A second , less direct mechanism which also modulates axonal growth via changes in intracellular calcium con - centrations involves eukaryotic elongation factor - 2 ( eEF2 ) , an essential translation factor modulated by Ca 2 + / CaM [ 69 ] . Iizuka et al . [ 70 ] and Iketani et al . [ 71 ] found that particular calcium elevations within growth cones lead to phosphorylation of eEF2 by eEF2 kinase . Dephosphory - lated eEF2 promotes mRNA translation whereas phos - phorylated eEF2 inhibits translation , and through this mechanism calcium elevations reduce axonal growth [ 71 ] . Furthermore , elevation in calcium also leads to a reduction in the total amount of eEF2 within the growth cone , perhaps through a calcium - mediated protein degra - dation pathway . By contrast , both BDNF and NGF are known to increase the levels of active eEF2 [ 72 , 73 ] , and this suggests that phosphorylation of eEF2 may depend on calcium entry mechanisms or the precise magnitude of calcium elevation . Attractive factors such as BDNF [ 40 ] , NGF [ 68 ] , and netrin - 1 [ 45 , 64 ] , which rely on calcium signaling to produce attractive responses , are also known to promote growth cone motility in a calcium - dependent manner . Similarly , the repulsive guidance cue MAG reduces axon outgrowth in a calcium - dependent manner [ 40 ] . Wnt5a , a recently characterized calcium - dependent guidance cue , does not behave in this manner but instead is both a repulsive guidance cue and an axon outgrowth promoter [ 49 ] ( Box 2 ) . Concluding remarks Although Ca 2 + has long been implicated as a second mes - senger in growth cone turning , it is only over the past few years that the precise distributions and mechanisms for attraction and repulsion have been elucidated . Many dif - ferent mechanisms for intracellular Ca 2 + elevation have been discovered , including release from ER stores ( CICR and IICR ) and entry from extracellular sources ( CRAC , SOCE , and voltage - sensitive Ca 2 + channels ) [ 22 , 33 , 34 , 38 ] . A complex pathway which interprets these intracellular Review Trends in Neurosciences August 2014 , Vol . 37 , No . 8 429 Ca 2 + signals to determine attraction or repulsion has been described [ 45 , 47 ] , together with a recent model which represents this pathway mathematically [ 42 ] . Finally , re - cent work has developed a new understanding of the intracellular mechanisms which produce attraction and repulsion , principally exocytosis and endocytosis ( respec - tively ) . Although the ﬁndings in recent years have contributed greatly to our understanding of axon guidance and its role in development and regeneration , there are still many out - standing questions ( Box 3 ) . One of the most fundamental of these is whether the effects of Ca 2 + are mediated purely by its spatial concentration distribution , or whether its method of entry is also important ( for instance , particular Ca 2 + release mechanisms could also trigger other signaling path - ways which are independent of Ca 2 + , potentially modulating the effects of the resulting Ca 2 + increase ) . We propose here the former hypothesis : that the same responses will be observed in response to a particular Ca 2 + distribution , irrespective of which of the many ways that distribution could have been produced ( e . g . , CICR , IICR , and SOCE , via different types of membrane channels ) . This is consistent with current experimental results , including those utilizing direct elevation of Ca 2 + concentrations , which are difﬁcult to explain from the alternative standpoint . It is also the as - sumption at the heart of the mathematical model of [ 42 ] , Box 2 . A newly discovered chemotaxis molecule – Wnt5a To demonstrate concepts of Ca 2 + - mediated axon guidance we consider the Ca 2 + - mediated mechanisms of axon guidance by Wnt5a . Wnt5a is a member of the Wnt family of morphogens which are involved in a wide range of developmental processes [ 81 ] . In addition to its roles during embryogenesis , Wnt5a has recently been implicated in repulsive guidance of post - crossing axons in the corpus callosum in a calcium - dependent manner [ 49 ] . Wnt5a creates intracellular responses through the related to receptor tyrosine kinase ( Ryk ) and Frizzled ( Fz ) receptors [ 49 ] . In particular Li et al . [ 49 ] demonstrated both Ryk and Fz receptors are necessary for repulsive axon guidance . In contrast to other common repulsive guidance cues ( such as MAG and Sema3A ) , Wnt5a does not decrease axon outgrowth but instead enhances it [ 49 , 82 ] . Increased axon outgrowth is observed both in bath application of Wnt5a and during repulsive turning induced by a Wnt5a gradient . In contrast to repulsive guidance , the Wnt5a - dependent increase in axon outgrowth is mediated exclusively by the Ryk receptor [ 49 ] . Wnt5a increases the frequency of calcium transients through both Ryk and Fz receptors ; inhibition of either receptor significantly decreases the frequency of calcium transients in vitro [ 49 ] . In addition , gradients of Wnt5a are sufficient to induce repulsion , accompanied by underlying asymmetric calcium transients across the growth cone such that transients are higher on the opposite side to growth direction [ 49 ] , confirming the necessary involvement of calcium in the growth cone response to Wnt5a . The Wnt5a / Ca 2 + pathway uses both SOC channels ( in particular TRPC channels ) and IICR to induce calcium signaling . However , axon outgrowth and axon guidance in response to Wnt5a are differentially controlled through these two calcium signaling mechanisms [ 49 ] . In particular , axon outgrowth is decreased by inhibition of either TRPC channels or IICR ( through inhibition of either IP 3 receptors or PLC ) , whereas repulsive axon guidance is only affected by TRPC channels . Inhibition of CaMKII , a well - known component of other Ca 2 + pathways which increase outgrowth , reduces Wnt5a - induced outgrowth [ 49 ] but does not affect repulsive axon guidance . These results suggest that two distinct Wnt5a / Ca 2 + pathways are present . The first , which increases axon outgrowth , involves SOCE ( TRPC channels ) , IICR ( IP 3 R and PLC ) , and CaMKII . The pathway controlling Wnt5a - mediated repulsive axon guidance involves TRPC channels , a common component of SOCE , and CaMKII . Although the Wnt5a / Ca 2 + pathways were first described in vitro , similar results have since been observed in vivo [ 82 ] . Wnt5a has been implicated in repulsive guidance post corpus callosum crossing [ 66 ] . Postcrossing axons have a higher rate of outgrowth than precrossing axons [ 82 ] , which these authors attributed to the presence of Wnt5a after corpus callosum crossing . Both of the Wnt5a effects in growth cones are influenced by microtubule reorganization [ 83 ] . This is induced by CaMKII phosphorylation of tau at Ser262 . Tau phosphoryla - tion is necessary for both Wnt5a - mediated turning and axon out - growth , confirming conserved microtubule action in both responses . Box 3 . Outstanding questions Although our understanding of calcium involvement in axon guidance has been significantly increased over the past few years , some of the questions that remain unanswered are detailed below . ! Axon guidance via growth cone turning is heavily dependent on calcium concentrations [ 42 , 44 , 84 , 85 ] , and calcium has been implicated in controlling axon outgrowth [ 40 , 71 , 83 , 86 ] . Is calcium signaling involved in axon guidance by growth rate modulation [ 67 , 68 ] ? Are mechanisms from steep gradient axon guidance conserved ? ! Studies have indicated that many of the inhibitors and activators of PKA are nonspecific and also affect Epac ; similarly , the agonist SP - cAMPS also activates Epac [ 87 , 88 ] , and Epac knockdown has been demonstrated to abolish attraction in response to calcium - mediated guidance cues [ 78 ] . Can the functional effects of PKA and Epac be grouped without losing information ? Is PKA or Epac the cAMP effector in processes including initializing calcium entry via IICR [ 22 ] and VDCCs [ 21 ] , and controlling the proposed attraction / repulsion switch [ 42 , 47 ] ? ! Although the pathway and model for an attraction / repulsion switch [ 42 , 47 ] does not consider specific methods of calcium entry separately , it has been suggested that the method of entry affects the turning response [ 30 , 89 ] . Can this be understood only in terms of resulting calcium distributions ? ! How does cGMP affect parts of the network other than VDCCs and CICR ( if at all ) ? ! Does the pathway described by the model of Forbes et al . [ 42 ] explain responses to gradients of Sema3A , Wnt5a , and sonic hedgehog [ 17 , 90 , 91 ] ? ! Can the calcium - dependent CaMKII / CaN pathway [ 45 ] also explain turning responses to guidance factors such as Sema3A and morphogens ( as has been suggested for Wnt5a [ 83 ] ) , or are there distinct non - conserved components in these pathways ? ! CaN has been strongly implicated in repulsion [ 42 , 45 , 47 ] and is sufficient to induce endocytosis in other settings within growth cones [ 92 ] ; does it directly induce endocytosis in response to repulsive cues [ 17 ] ? ! What role does calcium signaling play in the response to physical cues ? ! Calcium elevations are crucial in the repulsive response to MAG [ 16 , 45 ] , and MAG is known to inhibit axonal regeneration in vivo [ 93 ] . Can controlling calcium concentrations influence axonal regeneration after injury ? ! Calcium regulates Rho GTPase function ; however , the exact relationship between calcium elevations , Rho GTPase function , and cytoskeletal changes is not entirely clear . Does calcium only induce Rho GTPase activity through molecules such as protein kinase C and CaMKII , or does it also have further downstream roles ? Review Trends in Neurosciences August 2014 , Vol . 37 , No . 8 430 which explains growth cone turning responses as the spatial distribution of Ca 2 + is varied . However , this is only one of the exciting areas awaiting further exploration in the future study of calcium dynamics in axon guidance .
