We have realized a quantum node by combining the entanglement of atomic and photonic qubits with the atom - photon quan - tum state transfer . By implementing the second node at a different location and performing a joint detection of the signal photons from the two nodes , the quantum repeater protocol ( 11 ) , as well as distant te - leportation of an atomic qubit , may be real - ized . Based on this work , we estimate the rate for these protocols to be R 2 ; ( $ O " n s ) 2 R ; 3 (cid:1) 10 j 7 s j 1 . However , improvements in O that are based on increasing the optical thickness of atomic samples ( 16 ) , as well as elimination of transmission losses , could pro - vide several orders of magnitude increase in R 2 . Our results also demonstrate the possi - bility of realizing quantum nodes consisting of multiple atomic qubits by using multiple beams of light . This approach shows prom - ise for implementation of distributed quan - tum computation ( 20 , 21 ) . References and Notes 1 . I . Chuang , M .

Firsov 2 We describe monocrystalline graphitic films , which are a few atoms thick but are nonetheless stable under ambient conditions , metallic , and of remarkably high quality . The films are found to be a two - dimensional semimetal with a tiny overlap between valence and conductance bands , and they exhibit a strong ambipolar electric field effect such that electrons and holes in concentrations up to 10 13 per square centimeter and with room - temperature mobilities of È 10 , 000 square centimeters per volt - second can be induced by applying gate voltage . The ability to control electronic properties of a material by externally applied voltage is at the heart of modern electronics . In many cases , it is the electric field effect that allows one to vary the carrier concentration in a semiconductor device and , consequently , change an electric current through it . As the semiconductor industry is nearing the limits of performance improvements for the current technologies dominated by silicon , there is a constant search for new , nontraditional mate - rials whose properties can be controlled by the electric field . The most notable recent examples of such materials are organic conductors ( 1 ) and carbon nanotubes ( 2 ) . It has long been tempting to extend the use of the field effect to metals E e . g . , to develop all - metallic transistors that could be scaled down to much smaller sizes and would consume less energy and operate at higher frequencies than traditional semiconducting devices ( 3 ) ^ . However , this would require atomically thin metal films , because the electric field is screened at extremely short distances ( G 1 nm ) and bulk carrier concentrations in metals are large compared to the surface charge that can be induced by the field effect . Films so thin tend to be thermodynamically unstable , be - coming discontinuous at thicknesses of sev - eral nanometers ; so far , this has proved to be an insurmountable obstacle to metallic elec - tronics , and no metal or semimetal has been shown to exhibit any notable ( 9 1 % ) field ef - fect ( 4 ) . We report the observation of the electric field effect in a naturally occurring two - dimensional ( 2D ) material referred to as few - layer graphene ( FLG ) . Graphene is the name given to a single layer of carbon atoms densely packed into a benzene - ring struc - ture , and is widely used to describe proper - ties of many carbon - based materials , including graphite , large fullerenes , nanotubes , etc . ( e . g . , carbon nanotubes are usually thought of as graphene sheets rolled up into nanometer - sized cylinders ) ( 5 – 7 ) . Planar graphene itself has been presumed not to exist in the free state , being unstable with respect to the formation of curved structures such as soot , fullerenes , and nanotubes ( 5 – 14 ) . 1 Department of Physics , University of Manchester , Manchester M13 9PL , UK . 2 Institute for Microelec - tronics Technology , 142432 Chernogolovka , Russia . * To whom correspondence should be addressed .

Despite being atomically thin , the films remain of high quality , so that 2D electronic transport is ballistic at submicrometer distances . No other film of similar thickness is known to be even poorly metallic or continuous under ambient conditions . Using FLG , we demon - strate a metallic field - effect transistor in which the conducting channel can be switched between 2D electron and hole gases by changing the gate voltage . Our graphene films were prepared by mechanical exfoliation ( repeated peeling ) of small mesas of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite ( 15 ) . This approach was found to be highly reliable and allowed us to prepare FLG films up to 10 6 m in size . Thicker films ( d Q 3 nm ) were up to 100 6 m across and visible by the naked eye . Figure 1 shows examples of the prepared films , including single - layer graphene E see also ( 15 ) ^ . To study their electronic properties , we pro - cessed the films into multiterminal Hall bar devices placed on top of an oxidized Si substrate so that a gate voltage V g could be applied . We have studied more than 60 devices with d G 10 nm . We focus on the electronic properties of our thinnest ( FLG ) devices , which contained just one , two , or three atomic layers ( 15 ) . All FLG devices exhibited essentially identical electronic properties characteristic for a 2D semimetal , which differed from a more complex ( 2D plus 3D ) behavior observed for thicker , multilayer graphene ( 15 ) as well as from the properties of 3D graphite . In FLG , the typical dependence of its sheet resistivity D on gate voltage V g ( Fig . 2 ) exhibits a sharp peak to a value of several kilohms and decays to È 100 ohms at high V g ( note that 2D resistivity is given in units of ohms rather than ohms (cid:1) cm as in the 3D case ) . Its conductivity G 0 1 / D increases linearly with V g on both sides of the resistivity peak ( Fig . 2B ) . At the same V g where D has its peak , the Hall coefficient R H exhibits a sharp reversal of its sign ( Fig . 2C ) . The observed behavior resembles the ambipolar field effect in semiconductors , but there is no zero - conductance region associated with the Fermi level being pinned inside the band gap . Our measurements can be explained quantitatively by a model of a 2D metal with a small overlap & ( between conductance and valence bands ( 15 ) . The gate voltage induces a surface charge density n 0 ( 0 ( V g / te and , accordingly , shifts the position of the Fermi energy ( F . Here , ( 0 and ( are the permittivities of free space and SiO 2 , respec - tively ; e is the electron charge ; and t is the thickness of our SiO 2 layer ( 300 nm ) . For typical V g 0 100 V , the formula yields n , 7 . 2 (cid:1) 10 12 cm j 2 . The electric field doping transforms the shallow - overlap semimetal into either completely electron or completely hole conductor through a mixed state where both electrons and holes are present ( Fig . 2 ) . The three regions of electric field doping are clearly seen on both experimental and theoretical curves . For the regions with only electrons or holes left , R H decreases with increasing carrier concentration in the usual way , as 1 / ne . The resistivity also follows the standard dependence D j 1 0 G 0 ne 6 ( where 6 is carrier mobility ) . In the mixed state , G changes little with V g , indicating the substi - tution of one type of carrier with another , while the Hall coefficient reverses its sign , reflecting the fact that R H is proportional to Fig . 1 .

Without electric field doping ( at zero V g ) , FLG was found to be a hole metal , which is seen as a shift of the peak in D to large positive V g . However , this shift is attributed to an unintentional doping of the films by absorbed water ( 16 , 17 ) . Indeed , we found that it was possible to change the position of the peak by annealing our devices in vacuum , which usually resulted in shifting of the peak close to zero voltages . Exposure of the annealed films to either water vapor or NH 3 led to their p - and n - doping , respec - tively ( 15 ) . Therefore , we believe that intrin - sic FLG is a mixed - carrier material . Carrier mobilities in FLG were deter - mined from field - effect and magnetoresist - ance measurements as 6 0 G ( V g ) / en ( V g ) and 6 0 R H / D , respectively . In both cases , we obtained the same values of 6 , which varied from sample to sample between 3000 and 10 , 000 cm 2 / V I s . The mobilities were practi - cally independent of absolute temperature T , indicating that they were still limited by scattering on defects . For 6 , 10 , 000 cm 2 / V I s and our typical n , 5 (cid:1) 10 12 cm j 2 , the mean free path is È 0 . 4 6 m , which is surprising given that the 2D gas is at most a few ) away from the interfaces . However , our findings are in agreement with equally high 6 observed for intercalated graphite ( 5 ) , where charged dopants are located next to graphene sheets . Carbon nanotubes also exhib - it very high 6 , but this is commonly attributed to the suppression of scattering in the 1D case . Note that for multilayer graphene , we observed mobilities up to È 15 , 000 cm 2 / V I s at 300 K and È 60 , 000 cm 2 / V I s at 4 K . Despite being essentially gigantic fuller - ene molecules and unprotected from the environment , FLG films exhibit pronounced Shubnikov – de Haas ( ShdH ) oscillations in both longitudinal resistivity D xx and Hall re - sistivity D xy ( Fig . 3A ) , serving as another indicator of the quality and homogeneity of the experimental system . Studies of ShdH os - cillations confirmed that electronic transport in FLG was strictly 2D , as one could reason - ably expect , and allowed us to fully charac - terize its charge carriers . First , we carried out the standard test and measured ShdH oscil - lations for various angles K between the magnetic field and the graphene films . The oscillations depended only on the perpendic - ular component of the magnetic field B I cos K , as expected for a 2D system . More impor - tant , however , we found a linear dependence of ShdH oscillations _ frequencies B F on V g ( Fig . 3B ) , indicating that the Fermi energies ( F of holes and electrons were proportional to their concentrations n . This dependence is qualitatively different from the 3D dependence ( F º n 2 / 3 and proves the 2D nature of charge carriers in FLG . Further analysis ( 15 ) of ShdH oscillations showed that only a single spa - tially quantized 2D subband was occupied up to the maximum concentrations achieved in our experiments ( È 3 (cid:1) 10 13 cm j 2 ) . It could be populated either by electrons with mass m e , 0 . 06 m 0 ( where m 0 is the free electron mass ) located in two equivalent valleys , or by light and heavy holes with masses of È 0 . 03 m 0 and È 0 . 1 m 0 and the double - valley degeneracy . These properties were found to be the same for all FLG films studied and are notably different from the electronic struc - ture of both multilayer graphene ( 15 ) and bulk graphite ( 5 – 7 ) . Note that graphene is expected ( 5 – 7 ) to have the linear energy dispersion and carriers with zero mass , and the reason why the observed behavior is so well described by the simplest free - electron model remains to be understood ( 15 ) . We also determined the band overlap & ( in FLG , which varied from 4 to 20 meV for different samples , presumably indicating a different number of graphene layers involved ( 18 ) . To this end , we first used a peak value D m of resistivity to calculate typical carrier concentrations in the mixed state , n 0 ( e . g . , at low T for the sample in Fig . 2 , A to C , with 6 , 4000 cm 2 / V and D m , 8 kilohms , n 0 was È 2 (cid:1) 10 11 cm j 2 ) . Then , & ( can be estimated as n 0 / D , where D 0 2 m e / > I 2 is the 2D density of electron states and I is Planck _ s constant divided by 2 > . For the discussed sample , this yields & ( , 4 meV E i . e . , much smaller than the overlap in 3D graphite ( È 40 meV ) ^ . Alternatively , & ( could be calculated from the temperature dependence of n 0 , which characterizes relative contribu - tions of intrinsic and thermally excited car - riers . For a 2D semimetal , n 0 ( T ) varies as n 0 ( 0 K ) I f I ln E 1 þ exp ( 1 / f ) ^ , where f 0 2 k B T / & ( and k B is Boltzmann _ s constant ; Fig . 2D shows the best fit to this dependence , which yields & ( , 6 meV . Different FLG devices were found to exhibit a ratio of n 0 ( 300 K ) / n 0 ( 0 ) between 2 . 5 and 7 , whereas for multilayer graphene it was only È 1 . 5 ( Fig . 2D ) . This clearly shows that & ( decreases with decreasing number of graphene layers . The observed major reduction of & ( is in agreement with the fact that single - layer graphene is in theory a zero - gap semicon - ductor ( 5 , 18 ) . Graphene maybe the best possible metal for metallic transistor applications . In addition to the scalability to true nanometer sizes envis - aged for metallic transistors , graphene also offers ballistic transport , linear current - voltage ( I - V ) characteristics , and huge sustainable currents ( 9 10 8 A / cm 2 ) ( 15 ) . Graphene tran - sistors show a rather modest on - off resistance ratio ( less than È 30 at 300 K ; limited because Fig . 3 . ( A ) Examples of ShdH oscillations for one of our FLG devices for different gate volt - ages ; T 0 3 K , and B is the mag - netic field . As the black curve shows , we often observed pronounced plateau - like features in D xy at val - ues close to ( h / 4 e 2 ) / 8 ( in this case , ( F matches the Landau level with filling factor 8 0 2 at around 9 T ) . Such not - fully - developed Hall plateaus are usually viewed as an early indication of the quantum Hall effect in the situations where D xx does not yet reach the zero - resistance state .

Solid lines are guides to the eye . The linear dependence B F º V g indicates a constant ( 2D ) density of states ( 15 ) . The observed slopes ( solid lines ) account for the entire external charge n induced by gate voltage , confirming that there are no other types of carriers and yielding the double - valley degeneracy for both electrons and holes ( 15 ) . The inset shows an example of the temperature dependence of amplitude % of ShdH oscillations ( circles ) , which is fitted by the standard dependence T / sinh ( 2 > 2 k B T / I < c ) where < c is their cyclotron frequency .

Nonetheless , such on - off ratios are considered sufficient for logic circuits ( 19 ) , and it is feasible to increase the ratio further by , for example , using p - n junctions , local gates ( 3 ) , or the point contact geometry . However , by analogy to carbon nanotubes ( 2 ) , other , nontransistor applications of this atomically thin material ultimately may prove to be the most exciting . References and Notes 1 . C . D .

Neumark 1 , 3 * The electronic relaxation dynamics of size - selected ( H 2 O ) n – / ( D 2 O ) n – [ 25 e n e 50 ] clusters have been studied with time - resolved photoelectron imaging . The excess electron ( e c – ) was excited through the e c – ( p ) @ e c – ( s ) transition with an ultrafast laser pulse , with subsequent evolution of the excited state monitored with photodetachment and photoelectron imaging . All clusters exhibited p - state population decay with concomitant s - state repopulation ( internal conversion ) on time scales ranging from 180 to 130 femtoseconds for ( H 2 O ) n – and 400 to 225 femtoseconds for ( D 2 O ) n – ; the lifetimes decrease with increasing cluster sizes . Our results support the ‘‘nonadiabatic relaxa - tion’’ mechanism for the bulk hydrated electron ( e aq – ) , which invokes a 50 - femtosecond e aq – ( p ) Y e aq – ( s . ) internal conversion lifetime . A free electron introduced into a polar sol - vent , such as water ( 1 ) or ammonia ( 2 ) , may be trapped by locally oriented solvent mole - cules . In water , an B equilibrated [ hydrated electron E e aq – ( s ) ^ can be transiently confined within a roughly spherical cavity defined by six OH bonds oriented toward the negative charge distribution in the so - called Kevan geometry ( 3 – 5 ) . The hydrated electron is an important reagent in condensed - phase chem - istry and molecular biology , as it participates in radiation chemistry , electron transfer , and charge - induced reactivity . Thus , research in - vestigating the dynamics of this species , whether in the presence or absence of other reagents , has attracted considerable attention in the theoretical and experimental physical chemistry communities . Here , we present time - resolved results on the electronic relax - ation dynamics of anionic clusters of water that lend profound insight to the elucidation of hydrated electron dynamics in the bulk . The electronic energetics of a hydrated electron are characterized by three types of states ( Fig . 1A ) : a localized e aq – ( s ) ground state ; three localized , near - degenerate e aq – ( p ) excited states ; and a delocalized conduction band ( CB ) characterized by a charge distri - bution spread across hundreds of molecules in the solvent B network . [ The visible ab - sorption spectrum of the equilibrium hy - drated electron , a broad band peaking at 720 nm ( 1 ) , is well understood as an ex - citation from the occupied e aq – ( s ) state to the vacant e aq – ( p ) states ( 4 , 5 ) . The electron - solvent dynamics subsequent to e aq – ( p ) @ e aq – ( s ) excitation are more controversial , how - ever , in spite of considerable experimental ( 6 – 12 ) and theoretical ( 13 , 14 ) effort devoted to this problem . Transient absorption measurements made with femtosecond ( fs ) laser pulses as short as 5 fs ( 12 ) show a near infrared ( NIR ) absorption band beyond 900 nm developing on a 40 - to 50 - fs time scale after e aq – ( p ) @ e aq – ( s ) excitation . This broad feature shifts back to shorter wavelengths on a time scale of several hundred fs , with recovery of the original e aq – ( s ) absorption spectrum largely complete within È 1 picosecond ( ps ) . Deuteration of the solvent ( 8 , 12 ) appears only to affect the fastest measured time scale ( i . e . , the buildup time of the transient NIR absorption ) , with C D 2 O / C H 2 O 0 1 . 4 to 1 . 6 . As described by Yokoyama et al . ( 8 ) , two rather different energy relaxation mechanisms have been proposed to account for these observations . In the B adiabatic solvation [ scheme ( 13 , 14 ) , the infrared transient at the earliest times is attributed to absorption of the e aq – ( p ) electron , which is solvated on the upper state within 50 fs ( process x in Fig . 1A ) . The excited electron then undergoes internal conversion ( IC ) to the ground state ( y ) on a 400 - fs time scale , generating ground - state electrons that further relax on the È 1 - ps time scale by dissipating energy to the solvent . In contrast , the B nonadiabatic relaxation [ mechanism ( 7 , 9 , 12 ) invokes much more rapid IC , on a 50 - fs time scale , and attributes the transient NIR band at early times to absorption of the ground - state electron in a vibrationally excited solvent environment . In this model , subsequent dynamics are assigned to reorganization of the local ( È 400 fs ) and extended ( È 1 ps ) solvent network following the electronic decay . We present an alternative and comple - mentary approach to assessing the relaxation dynamics of the hydrated electron through time - resolved photoelectron imaging ( TRPEI ) studies ( 15 ) of electron dynamics in size - selected water cluster anions , ( H 2 O ) n – and ( D 2 O ) n – , with 25 e n e 50 .
