Research sug - gests that technologies implemented in communities can worsen existing inequalities , yet there is little understanding of what underserved residents think about urban technolo - gies or how they engage with their cities about technology policies or practices . Based on two technology forums held in underserved communities , we found that residents are motivated to participate in city technology planning because they believe technology impacts the economic and social health of their communities and because they are wary of the city’s intentions behind certain urban technologies and policies . However , avenues for such engagement with the city were not accessible to our participants . We conclude that residents’ participation in existing forms of governance poses an opportunity for city ofﬁcials and those in under - served communities to collaboratively build urban technolo - gies that beneﬁt all .

Smart city technolo - gies include innovative digital solutions that use data an - alytics to address urban issues such as transportation , public safety , economic development , and environmental conditions ( e . g . , rainfall , ﬂooding , energy consumption ) [ 16 ] . Data generated from smart city technologies are of - ten made available for public consumption , leading to the creation of civic technologies , which is a broad category that includes tools that leverage such data for public good [ 6 , 26 ] . Henceforth , we refer to smart city technologies and civic technologies as “urban technologies .

Demographic data was collected in a survey ( n = 37 ) . The proliferation of urban technologies has led many cities to create city technology plans . City planning typically in - cludes stakeholders such as residents , private companies , and nonproﬁt organizations . Studies on such partnerships suggest that involving residents in the creation of policies that impact their communities is important [ 13 , 14 ] . Addi - tionally , given the potential for urban technologies to worsen existing inequalities [ 10 , 23 , 24 ] , it is essential to include residents of underserved communities in the design of ur - ban technologies , plans , and policies . By underserved , we are referring to resource constrained communities that have historically faced considerable social and economic dis - advantage due to lack of investment and other unfair poli - cies and practices at an institutional level [ 21 , 27 ] . Thus , we address the following questions in this exploratory study : What are underserved residents’ perceptions of urban tech - nologies in their communities and of local technology poli - cies ? What factors shape these perceptions ? Our results extend prior HCI research that focus on design - ing technologies in cities [ 3 , 7 , 17 , 18 , 20 ] and residents’ participation in local governance [ 4 , 11 ] . This paper con - tributes an understanding of residents’ perceptions and concerns about urban technologies and policies and iden - tiﬁes opportunities to develop a more inclusive technology planning and policymaking process . Related Work Prior literature suggest that though some residents in un - derserved communities actively participate in the gov - ernance of their communities , particularly around non - technology related issues [ 11 , 13 , 14 ] , they tend to have low levels of trust in government institutions [ 25 ] . Recent stud - ies in HCI focus on how underserved communities engage with city ofﬁcials about decision - making in their communi - ties [ 11 , 12 ] , and community engagement has been widely studied in HCI [ 3 , 4 , 5 , 12 , 15 , 17 ] . However , there has been little focus on how residents in underserved commu - nities engage in the governance of technology , and though there has been research in HCI on the role of trust in com - munity engagement [ 9 ] , there is a lack of understanding of how trust may impact people’s perceptions of urban tech - nologies and technology policies . Our results suggest that there is little opportunity to engage in participatory gover - nance of technology and identiﬁes concerns residents in underserved communities have about their city’s technology policies and use of urban technologies . Methods To examine our research questions , we held two urban technology forums in two communities in Chicago , Illinois . Local not - for - proﬁt organizations that have credibility within their communities hosted the forums . Both communities ex - perience high poverty , high crime , and low education . Table 1 summarizes the participant demographics . There were a total of 55 parcipants . CHI 2018 Late - Breaking Abstract CHI 2018 , April 21 – 26 , 2018 , Montréal , QC , Canada LBW530 , Page 2 Each forum lasted about 3 hours . We guided participants through activities to understand their participation in lo - cal governance , identify local assets and challenges , and brainstorm interventions . Assets included parks , libraries , churches , and public transit ; challenges included violent crime , lack of quality businesses , lack of access to tech education and infrastructure , and the city’s use of urban technologies for revenue rather than safety . We encouraged participants to think broadly about technology , and gave ex - amples ranging from PCs to public displays at bus stops . Our goal was for residents to lead the conversation , there - fore we did not limit the discussion to urban technology . In addition to 24 hours of audio and video recordings , we collected artifacts ( i . e . , 274 sticky notes , 9 annotated large maps , 33 worksheets ) , 267 photos of the sessions , and 31 pages of ﬁeld notes from observations . We analyzed the ﬁeld notes and all written artifacts ( i . e , sticky notes , work - sheets , maps ) using inductive qualitative analysis [ 22 ] . Tech Forum Activities Icebreaker In groups of 5 - 8 , participants chose an image to represent their group . The provided images were cut from mag - azines or were photos of the community printed from Google Streetview . Next , they discussed any past experi - ences they had with commu - nity governance forums such as community - police meet - ings or meetings with local city council ofﬁcials . Mapping Remaining in groups , each participant wrote what they believed to be their com - munity’s assets , general challenges , and technology gaps and / or challenges on color - coded stickies and placed them on their group’s poster - sized map . Brainstorm The ﬁnal activity was to brain - storm interventions that ad - dressed the challenges iden - tiﬁed in the mapping activity . Participants chose the topics to address in the brainstorm , which was led by facilitators . Findings Our results suggest that residents are not only concerned about their access to technology resources ( e . g . , internet , tech education ) , but also about the city’s use of urban tech - nologies and data in their communities . These perceptions appear to be inﬂuenced by residents’ distrust of the city , and contributed to their desire to participate in the city’s technology planning and policymaking process . Though our participants engaged in established forms of local governance ( e . g . , ward meetings , community - police meetings ) , they felt that there are not enough opportunities to engage with city ofﬁcials about technology . One person wanted “more opportunities to discuss where tech is going and why and who has access to data and what they are doing with it " [ Community 1 ( C1 ) sticky note ] . Interest in the city’s technology plans drove several participants to attend the technology forums [ C2 icebreaker worksheets ] . Participants indicated a demand for participating in the gov - ernance of technology because they view technology as interwoven with community challenges , such as job access and crime , and because they have ideas for technology in - terventions that would promote community development . A group in C2 wanted " a place to go to improve your com - puter skills and have access to a computer and the internet [ because ] you can’t apply for a job without a computer " [ C2 sticky note ] . Another participant wanted the police in her precinct to use an online crime reporting technology that she heard is used in other precincts [ C2 ﬁeld notes ] . Res - idents had ideas about how to leverage local assets to im - prove technology access and strengthen their community , such as by holding pop - up technology demonstrations in vacant storefronts [ C1 sticky note ] . Though there was a general sentiment that urban tech - nology has potential for creating public good , our ﬁndings suggest that residents do not trust the city’s motivations for using certain urban technologies and question the safety of the data collected by these technologies . One partici - pant was concerned that a crime reporting app might not be truly anonymous [ C2 ﬁeld notes ] , and a group of partic - ipants raised questions about how data from surveillance cameras is used and who has access to it [ C1 ﬁeld notes ] . Another person compared the city’s use of technology for revenue versus safety , saying “In the community ﬁve people are shot but no one can track this . They can track cars [ with outstanding tickets ] to boot them , but can’t track the people being shot and killed . Finding a murderer doesn ' t generate revenue for the city but boots do [ . . ] . " [ C1 ﬁeld notes ] . The unequal distribution of internet service in the city [ 1 ] was an important policy issue for our participants , and illus - CHI 2018 Late - Breaking Abstract CHI 2018 , April 21 – 26 , 2018 , Montréal , QC , Canada LBW530 , Page 3 trated their distrust of the city . Some participants attributed the lack of internet access in their community to a political agenda of disenfranchisement , because " not having inter - net locks you out of employment and corporate America , and it does [ so ] by design " [ C1 ﬁeld notes ] . Participants wanted the city to regulate internet pricing ( as it does with other utilites like water and gas ) and ensure equal broad - band internet access . “All companies should provide wiﬁ [ in all communities ] . The city should identify areas that have limited wiﬁ . Residents should hold the city and the alder - man accountable " [ C2 ﬁeld notes ] . Discussion This study describes how local residents in underserved communities view urban technologies , the institutions im - plementing and utilizing these technologies , and the gov - ernance of technology . Our results suggest that a nuanced understanding of community complexities and residents’ perceptions of urban technologies is necessary to develop equitable urban technologies . By community complexities , we are referring to the realities that impact the lived expe - rience of residents , such as access to jobs , education , and local businesses , and experiential qualities such as safety , community pride , and trust in local ofﬁcials . Results from our study indicate that residents do not separate their so - cial and economic circumstances from their perceptions of technology , but instead , these factors motivate residents’ participation in technology planning . One way to begin to understand how these complexities are tied to technology is to include residents in underserved communities in the research , planning , and development of urban technologies and policies . To build successful partnerships , it will be necessary to consider the historic distrust that underserved communities have towards gov - ernment ofﬁcials due to decades of policies that negatively impact , or do not address , issues faced by their communi - ties ( such as lack of investment and educational opportuni - ties , overpolicing , concentrated poverty , lack of economic development , and unfair sentencing that leads to high in - carceration ) [ 2 , 8 , 21 , 19 , 27 ] . Such issues have lead to considerable social and economic disadvantages among residents in underserved communities , fostering distrust in the institutions that create policies that perpetuate these issues . Technology and internet access may be a newer issue compared to other disparities faced by underserved communities , but residents view it as important and want to participate in technology planning and policymaking . There are established avenues of engagement between residents and city ofﬁcials around issues such as crime , which have clear accountability structures [ 12 , 13 ] . Our ﬁndings suggest that residents are seeking a similar venue to communicate with the city about technology . Therefore , there is an opportunity for to leverage residents’ participa - tion in established meetings to make technology governing structures more visible . For instance , participants were con - cerned that the city does not make internet providers offer service in all communities ; however , the city has little ability to control internet providers . During local ward meetings , city representatives could clarify the city’s role in internet provision so that residents better understand the city’s au - thority . Furthermore , city representatives could use such meetings to refer residents to the appropriate avenues to address their concerns about technology . Such communi - cation should start at established civic meetings until en - gagement procedures for city tech planning are established . Creating a platform for city technology engagement and ac - countability could develop communities’ trust of tech plan - ners and urban technologies . An avenue for participation could also enable the development of an inclusive research CHI 2018 Late - Breaking Abstract CHI 2018 , April 21 – 26 , 2018 , Montréal , QC , Canada LBW530 , Page 4 and design process that accounts for community complexi - ties and results in more equitable urban technologies . Conclusions and Future Work It is necessary to understand the challenges underserved communities face , as well as their assets , when designing urban technologies . Involving residents in the development of urban technologies could help develop effective tools and positively impact trust between underserved residents and the city . Future work should explore structures that support engagement in city tech planning . Acknowledgements We thank the technology forum participants for contributing their thoughts and stories .
