The FASEB Journal (cid:127) Research Communication Focal adhesion size uniquely predicts cell migration Dong - Hwee Kim and Denis Wirtz 1 Johns Hopkins Physical Sciences – Oncology Center and Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering , Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore , Maryland , USA ABSTRACT Focal adhesions are large protein com - plexes organized at the basal surface of cells , which physically connect the extracellular matrix to the cyto - skeleton and have long been speculated to mediate cell migration . However , whether clustering of these molec - ular components into focal adhesions is actually re - quired for these proteins to regulate cell motility is unclear . Here we use quantitative microscopy to char - acterize descriptors of focal adhesion and cell motility for mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts and human ﬁbrosar - coma cells , across a wide range of matrix compliance and following genetic manipulations of focal adhesion proteins ( vinculin , talin , zyxin , FAK , and paxilin ) . This analysis reveals a tight , biphasic gaussian relationship between mean size of focal adhesions ( not their num - ber , surface density , or shape ) and cell speed . The predictive power of this relationship is comprehen - sively validated by disrupting nonfocal adhesion pro - teins ( (cid:1) - actinin , F - actin , and myosin II ) and subcellular organelles ( mitochondria , nuclear DNA , etc . ) not known to affect either focal adhesions or cell migra - tion . This study suggests that the mean size of focal adhesions robustly and precisely predicts cell speed independently of focal adhesion surface density and molecular composition . —Kim , D . - H . , Wirtz , D .

These proteins are involved in physical connections between the extra - cellular matrix and the actin cytoskeleton through transmembrane receptor integrins and mediate signal - ing between cell and environment ( 4 , 7 ) . Focal adhe - sions have long been speculated to play a critical role in many cell functions , in particular , cell migration ( 8 ) . The presumption that focal adhesions play a role in cell migration stems in part from the fact that rapidly moving cells , such as Dictyostelium discoideum and neu - trophils , display vanishingly small focal adhesions ( 14 ) , while slowly moving cells such as ﬁbroblasts show prominent focal adhesions . On the other hand , theo - retical modeling and manipulation of ligand density on the substrate have also shown that the cell migration speed changes biphasically depending on the adhesion strength between cell and substratum ( 15 , 16 ) . The apparent role of individual focal adhesion pro - teins in cell migration has been extensively studied through genetic manipulations and pharmacological interventions affecting the expresssion or activity of focal adhesion proteins ( 1 – 5 , 7 , 8 , 13 ) . However , whether a subset or all focal adhesion - speciﬁc proteins need to cluster into focal adhesion complexes in order to mediate cell migration is unknown , i . e . , whether any change in the clustering of focal adhesion proteins induced by a change in expression / activation of a known or yet unidentiﬁed regulator of focal adhesions or biophysical / biochemical changes in the microenvi - ronment necessarily can predict a change in cell migra - tion is unknown . This is partly due to the fact that a functional relationship between focal adhesions ( size , shape , number , turnover dynamics , etc . ) and cell motil - ity , if it exists , is largely missing . That any change in cell speed could be predicted by a change in focal adhesions is a priori unlikely . We ﬁrst determined functional relationships among descriptors of focal adhesion morphology and descriptors of cell motility , and then assessed the predictive power of relationships between these two families of descriptors through comprehensive blind tests affecting known and previously unknown regulators of cell speed and focal adhesions . 1 Correspondence : Johns Hopkins University , 3400 N .

Penicillin ( 100 U / ml ) and 100 (cid:3) g / ml streptomy - cin ( Sigma , St . Louis , MO , USA ) for MEFs and 0 . 1 % gentimi - cin ( Sigma ) for HT - 1080 were added , respectively . Cells infected with small hairpin RNA ( shRNA ) constructs were initially selected with medium containing 4 (cid:3) g / ml puromycin ( Sigma ) for 3 d and then maintained in medium with 3 (cid:3) g / ml puromycin added . Cells were maintained at 37°C with 5 % CO 2 in a humidiﬁed incubator and passaged every 3 – 4 d . F - actin depolymerizing drug latrunculin B ( Sigma ) , mito - chondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone ( Sigma ) , and cell cycle inhibitor bleomycin ( Sigma ) were diluted to ﬁnal con - centrations of 0 . 1 (cid:3) M ( or 1 (cid:3) M for high - dose treatment ) , 1 (cid:3) M , and 1 mM , respectively . Cells were incubated with each drug in culture medium for 1 h before ﬁxation . Substrate preparation Following the established method ( 1 , 17 ) , soft substrates denoted by stiff gel or soft gel were prepared by synthesizing polyacrylamide gel onto the 3 - aminopropyl - trimethoxysilane and 10 % glutaraldehyde - treated glass slides . Acrylamide and N , N - methylenebisacrylamide were mixed at a ﬁnal concentra - tion of 5 and 0 . 15 % ( for stiff gel or 0 . 015 % for soft gel ) in distilled H 2 O ( w / v ) , respectively . Ammonium persulfate ( 10 % ) and N , N , N = , N = - tetramethylethylenediamine ( Invitro - gen , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) were introduced as 5 and 0 . 5 % ( v / v ) of total mixture . The hydrogels were then treated with the UV - activable cross - linker , N - sulfosuccinimidyl - 6 - ( 4 = - azido - 2 = - nitrophenylamino ) hexanoate ( Pierce , Rockford , IL , USA ) to bind collagen to the surface where 0 . 2 mg / ml type I collagen ( BD Biosciences , San Jose , CA , USA ) diluted in 0 . 2 N acetic acid was coated for 6 h at 4°C . Glass slides were also prepared by coating the same collagen . All substrates were soaked into medium and kept in the incubator for 30 min to adapt substrates to the cell culture environment before plating cells . Protein depletion Following RNAi , sequences targeting mRNA were selected as described previously ( 17 , 18 ) . After treating cells with lentivi - ral - mediated RNAi , cells showing (cid:4) 90 % knockdown efﬁ - ciency were selected . They include the following ( number after the sequence denotes the targeting position in mRNA ) : mh - Talin1 , 2 , GTGGATGAGAAGACCAAGGA ( 1372 ) ; mh - Paxillin , gTCAAGGAGCAGAACGACAA ( 1770 ) ; mh - FAK , GGGCAT - CATTCAGAAGATA ( 507 ) ; m - ACTN1 , 4 , GGAGGACTTCCGA - GACTATA ( 1164 ) ; and m - Zyxin , GCCTGTGTCTTCTGCTAATA ( 1004 ) . A ﬁreﬂy luciferase shRNA was used as a control ( 5 = - GCTTACGCTGAGTACTTCGA ) . Using the predicted sequences above , the shRNA expression cassettes were constructed by joint PCR , as described . shRNA - induced protein depletion was fully validated by Western blots before use ( 17 , 18 ) . Immunoﬂuorescence and morphometric analysis Cells were incubated for 6 h after plating , ﬁxed with 2 % paraformaldehyde ( Sigma ) for 10 min , permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ( Fisher Biotech , Hampton , NH , USA ) for 10 min , and then blocked with PBS supplemented with FBS ( 10 % , v / v ) for 20 min . For immunostaining of focal adhe - sions , anti - vinculin antibody ( Sigma ) at 1 : 200 , anti - focal ad - hesion kinase ( FAK ) antibody ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA , USA ) at 1 : 50 , anti - paxillin antibody ( G . D . Longmore , Washington University in St . Louis , St . Louis , MO , USA ) at 1 : 100 , and anti - zyxin antibody ( Sigma ) at 1 : 100 were used . Actin ﬁlaments and nuclear DNA were stained using Alexa - Fluor phalloidin 488 and 300 nM 4 = , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( both from Invitrogen ) , respectively . For quantitative analysis of focal adhesions , ﬂuorescent images were collected using a Cascade 1K CCD camera ( Roper Scientiﬁc , Tucson , AZ , USA ) mounted on a ﬂuorescence microscope ( TE2000E ; Nikon , Melville , NY , USA ) or a confocal laser microscope ( A1 ; Nikon ) equipped with an (cid:1) 60 Plan Fluor lens ( N . A . 1 . 4 ) . Morphometric analysis ( area , perimeter , length , breadth , and shape factor ) of focal adhesions was conducted using image analysis soft - ware , Metamorph ( Molecular Devices , Downingtown , PA , USA ) , and images collected by confocal microscope were processed using NIS - Elements ( Nikon ) . Analysis of cell motility After incubating cells for 6 h , cells were moved to the live cell chamber , mounted on a ﬂuorescence microscope ( TE2000E ; Nikon ) and monitored using an (cid:1) 10 lens for 8 h .

Correlation assessment and linear regression are applied to the merged data sets regardless of substrate stiffness . Correlation coefﬁcients among all pairs of morphological parameters are summarized in Supplemental Fig . S1 . 3 FOCAL ADHESION SIZE UNIQUELY PREDICTS CELL MIGRATION dinates were recorded every 2 min . Cell speed was deﬁned as root - mean - squared displacement calculated every 2 min of time interval divided by 2 min . Custom - made MatLab code was used to calculate mean squared displacement ( MSD ) . Final distance was the displacement that a cell made for 8 h . To introduce persistence distance , persistence time , and number of turns , persistence vectors were calculated from cell tracking data ( x , y coordinates , distance , and time ) using an Excel macro ( Microsoft , Redmond , WA , USA ) as described previously ( 18 ) . A persistent move was deﬁned as the traveling length ( (cid:1) 10 (cid:3) m ) of a cell before it changed a moving direction signiﬁcantly ( (cid:4) 70° ) . Accordingly , persistent dis - tance and persistent time were deﬁned as the distance and duration that a cell traveled during a persistent move . The number of turns that deﬁnes the changes of persistent moves for 8 h of tracking interval was also counted . At least 50 cells were analyzed per condition . Data processing and statistical analysis To calculate and plot means (cid:8) sem of measured quantities , GraphPad Prism ( GraphPad Software , San Diego , CA , USA ) was used . Signiﬁcances were assessed by 2 - tailed unpaired t - tests . For multiple comparisons , 1 - way ANOVA was applied , using Bonferroni’s test to compare every pair of data or using Dunnette’s test to compare all other conditions to control , respectively . Degree of correlation of compared data sets was assessed by Pearson product moment correlation , and data were regressed by gaussian ﬁt or linear ﬁt . See individual ﬁgure captions to see the selected method . RESULTS Size and shape of focal adhesions are closely related Focal adhesions localized at the basal surface of MEFs and terminating actin stress ﬁbers typically displayed an ellipsoidal shape ( Fig . 1 A ) . Fibrillar adhesions , which evolve from mature focal adhesions , are located toward the center of the cell and contain very little focal adhesion components , such as paxillin and vinculin ( 19 , 20 ) . Therefore , we focused on vinculin - containing focal adhesions ( 21 ) . Size and shape of individual focal adhesions were characterized by surface area , perime - ter , length , breadth , and shape factor , deﬁned as 4 (cid:9) ( area ) / ( perimeter ) 2 , approaching 1 for a rounded and 0 for an elongated focal adhesion ( Fig . 1 B ) . Notably , we observed no signiﬁcant difference in mea - suring morphological parameters from staining with various antifocal adhesion antibodies , including vincu - lin , FAK , paxillin , and zyxin ( Fig . 1 C – G ) . To ensure sufﬁcient distribution in the values of the measured morphological parameters , cells were placed on sub - strates of different mechanical compliance , where size and shape of focal adhesions readily changed ( refs . 1 , 4 , 22 , 23 and Fig . 1 H – L ) . We found that all considered morphological parameters approximately followed gaussian statistics ( see color - coded normal distribution curves and corresponding r 2 values in Fig . 1 H – L ) . To assess relationships among descriptors of focal adhesion morphology , we calculated the Pearson prod - uct - moment correlation coefﬁcients r between any 2 parameters , which were averaged per cell and merged independently of substrate stiffness , and determined the degree of correlation through calculated r values . Degrees of correlation among focal adhesion descrip - tors were denoted as strong , moderate , and weak for r values : 0 . 80 (cid:2) | r | (cid:2) 1 , 0 . 65 (cid:2) | r | (cid:5) 0 . 80 , and | r | (cid:5) 0 . 65 , respectively ( see summary in Supplemental Fig . S1 ) . As expected , the perimeter of focal adhesions increased with the length of long axis ( Fig . 1 M ) , while the shape factor of focal adhesions decreased as their size ( de - noted by area ) increased ( Fig . 1 N ) . Length and breadth of focal adhesions were weakly correlated ( Fig . 1 O ) . Confocal microscopy indicated that focal adhesions were elongated in the direction of their associated actin stress ﬁbers ( Fig . 1 A ) . These results are consistent with the growth model of force - induced focal adhesion driven by actomyosin - mediated tension ( 24 – 27 ) Conse - quently , large focal adhesions tended to be elongated , while small focal adhesions tended to be round over a wide range of substrate compliance . Cell speed weakly correlates with persistent motion of the cell To characterize randomly migrating cells , we measured cell speed as well as persistence time and distance , number of turns , and ﬁnal distance ( deﬁned as the total displacement that a cell made during the obser - vation time ; Fig . 2 A , B ) . Cell speed was calculated from the root mean square displacement , which is a more rigorous measure of distance than a direct use of segment length , as it eliminates sources of noises stemming from erratically meandering cell motion ( see more details on deﬁning parameters in Materials and Methods ) . Mean values and distributions of cell motility descriptors readily changed in cells placed on sub - strates of different compliance ( refs . 28 , 29 and Fig . 2 C – G ) . Similarly to focal adhesion descriptors ( Fig . 1 H – L ) , cell motility descriptors were well distributed . ( Fig . 2 C – G ) . As expected , when cells spent more time in each persistent move , they had fewer chances of switching into a next persistent move in the limited observation time , which resulted in fewer numbers of turns ( r (cid:2)(cid:7) 0 . 87 ; Fig . 2 H ) . Interestingly , the ﬁnal distance was moder - ately correlated with persistence distance ( r (cid:2) 0 . 68 ; Fig . 2 I ) , but weakly correlated with cell speed ( r (cid:2) 0 . 40 ; Fig . 2 J ) . These results indicate that fast - moving cells do not guarantee that they can move farther ( Fig . 2 J ) but rather cells that can maintain their directional move - ment ( thus higher persistence distance ) move farther ( Fig . 2 I ) ; cell speed is weakly correlated with persis - tence of migration ( Supplemental Fig . S1 A ) . Functional relationship between focal adhesion morphology and cell migration Now we can begin to test whether focal adhesion morphology can predict cell motility .

Degree of correlation between focal adhesion size and cell speed is not very strong ( r (cid:2) 0 . 66 ) , and cell speed changes ( continued on next page ) 6 Vol . 27 April 2013 KIM AND WIRTZ The FASEB Journal (cid:1) www . fasebj . org were added to the extracellular physical variations discussed so far so as to expand the data sets . Major focal adhesion proteins ( FAK , paxillin , talin , and zyxin ) were depleted using shRNA technology as reported previously ( 17 ) , and resulting cells were placed on substrates of controlled stiffness ( Fig . 3 A ) . Although individual effects of depletion of a focal adhesion protein or changes in substrate compliance on focal adhesion morphology or cell motility have been exten - sively studied ( 1 , 2 , 4 , 30 , 31 ) , effects of combined disturbances ( genetic and physical ) are hard to inter - pret , since deviation of measured quantities from the control condition is not simply sum of the two individ - ual effects , but the results of synergistic or compensa - tory effects that may be triggered by unrevealed or less related signal pathways . Therefore , instead of identify - ing the effects of individual disturbances , we compared the combined effect of 2 variations ( i . e . , substrate stiffness and genetic manipulations of focal adhesion proteins ) to the control condition ( i . e . , wild type [ WT ] cells on glass slide ) using 1 - way ANOVA ( Fig . 3 B – D and Supplemental Fig . S2 A , B ) . Pearson correlation analysis revealed that cell speed and persistence of migration were correlated with a subset of focal adhesion parameters ( Figs . 3 E , F and 4 and Supplemental Fig . S2 ) . Speciﬁcally , focal adhesion size moderately correlated with cell speed ( Fig . 3 E ) but weakly correlated with descriptors of migratory persis - tence ( Supplemental Fig . S2 C ) , while the shape factor of focal adhesions moderately correlated with cell speed ( Fig . 3 F ) as well as ﬁnal distance traveled and persistence distance ( Supplemental Fig . S2 D ) . Notably , focal adhesions were larger and more elongated in fast - moving cells ( Fig . 3 E , F ) . However , we also noted that the magnitude of correlation coefﬁcient between focal adhesion size and cell speed was not high , which suggested that focal adhesion size and cell speed were not well described by a linear relationship , as assumed by Pearson correlation analysis . Indeed , while focal adhesion shape and cell speed were monotonically related ( Fig . 3 F ) , we observed a prominent biphasic relationship between focal adhe - sion size and cell speed ( Fig . 3 E ) . Thus , gaussian ( i . e . , nonlinear ) and linear models were applied to the normalized data set ranged between 0 to 1 to assess the nonmonotonic response of cell speed to the changes in focal adhesion size ( Fig . 3 G , H ) . We found that a gaussian ﬁt of focal adhesion size vs . cell speed was excellent ( r 2 (cid:2) 0 . 93 ; Fig . 3 G ) , revealing a tight , non - monotonic relationship between focal adhesion size and cell speed . This result indicated that , over a wide range of conditions ( (cid:10) 70 % of the total range in measured focal adhesion size ) , cell speed increased when focal adhesions increase in size , until an optimum was reached . Moreover , a gaussian relationship be - tween focal adhesion size and cell speed ( r 2 (cid:2) 0 . 93 ; Fig . 3 G ) was much tighter than the linear relationship between focal adhesion shape factor and cell speed ( r 2 (cid:2) 0 . 61 ; Fig . 3 H ) , which suggests that focal adhesion size , rather than shape , was highly predictive of cell migration speed . We asked whether not only the mean size of individ - ual focal adhesions but also cumulative effect of all focal adhesions present in a cell predicted cell speed . To test this hypothesis , we measured the total number of focal adhesions per cell and focal adhesion area density , deﬁned as the fraction of the cell area occu - pied by focal adhesions ( Fig . 3 I , L ) . These parameters did not show considerable correlations with cell speed ( i . e . , at least , | r | (cid:1) 0 . 65 ) and they were poorly approxi - mated by linear and nonlinear ﬁts ( Fig . 3 J , K , M , N ) . These results reinforce the notion that focal adhesion size is a parameter that uniquely predicts cell speed , independently of the surface coverage of focal adhe - sions in a cell . Predictive power of focal adhesion size for cell migration speed So far , we have assessed the relationship between focal adhesion morphology and cell motility through genetic manipulation of focal adhesion components and con - trolled changes in substrate compliance , which are known to affect focal adhesions ( which we shall call the primary data set ) . Through 5 blind validating tests , we next tested disturbances progressively more remote ( physi - nonmonotonously with focal adhesion size ( E ) . Pearson coefﬁcient r , r 2 , and P values and corresponding plots of all pairs of descriptors of focal adhesion morphology and cell motility are summarized in Supplemental Fig . S2 and Fig . 4 . G , H ) Gaussian ( G ) and linear ( H ) regressions of size and shape factor of focal adhesions vs . cell speed . Goodness of the ﬁt of the gaussian relationship between focal adhesion size and cell speed ( r 2 (cid:2) 0 . 93 ) was greater than the linear relationship between focal adhesion shape factor and cell speed ( r 2 (cid:2) 0 . 61 ) . I , L ) Changes in number of focal adhesions per cell ( I ) and focal adhesion area density , deﬁned as the fraction of cell area occupied by focal adhesions ( L ) , in response to changes in substrate stiffness : rigid glass ( black ) , a stiff gel ( gray ) , and a soft gel ( white ) and depletion of focal adhesion proteins ( FAK , paxillin , talin , and zyxin ) . J , M ) Correlations of number of focal adhesions per cell ( J ) and area density ( % ) of focal adhesions ( M ) with cell speed . Both number and area density of focal adhesions per cell weakly correlate with cell speed ( i . e . , | r | (cid:5) 0 . 65 ) . K , N ) Assessment of regressed relationships of number of focal adhesions per cell ( K ) and area density of focal adhesions ( N ) with cell speed using either linear ( orange ) or gaussian ( blue ) models . goodness of ﬁts for both linear and gaussian relationships was relatively weak compared to focal adhesion size vs . cell speed ( G ) . In panels B – D , I , and L , focal adhesions were analyzed in (cid:4) 30 cells , and (cid:4) 50 cells were tracked per condition . Error bars represent sem of averaged values ; 1 - way ANOVA using Dunnett’s post test was applied based on the values in the WT cells on stiff substrate ( control ) for multiple comparisons .

First , (cid:11) - actinin - 1 , 4 , a major F - actin cross - linking / bundling protein ( 32 – 36 ) , which is associated with , but is not a component of , focal adhesions , was shRNA depleted , and resulting cells were tested on substrates of low and high compliance . Compared to control WT cells ( Fig . 5 A ) , the depletion of (cid:11) - actinin in cells on stiff substrates slightly reduced the size of focal adhesions , which led to little change in cell speed ( red bars , Fig . 5 E , F ) , as correctly predicted by the primary data set ( red diamond , Fig . 5 G ) . When these cells were placed on soft substrates , however , the size of focal adhesions changed signiﬁcantly ( Fig . 5 B ) , which in turn changed cell speed ( Supplemental Movie S1 ) . These coordi - nated changes in focal adhesion size and cell speed were again correctly predicted by the primary data set ( Fig . 5 E – G , orange ) . Next , cells were treated with latrunculin B , which inhibits the assembly of actin ﬁlaments ( 17 , 37 – 39 ) . Actin stress ﬁbers were gradually disassembled depend - ing on the concentration of latrunculin B ( Fig . 5 C ) . In cells treated with a high dose of latrunculin B ( 1 (cid:3) M ) , actin ﬁlaments were dismantled , and a majority of focal adhesions disappeared or diminished to small round punctuate focal adhesions ( Fig . 5 C ) , which restricted cell migration . By reducing the concentration of latrun - culin B to 0 . 1 (cid:3) M to avoid such an extreme response , we observed signiﬁcant decrease in the size of focal adhesions , which quantitatively decreased migration speed to the extent predicted by the primary data set ( Fig . 5 E – G , blue ) . Finally , in order to further test the predictive power of the relationship between focal adhesion size and cell speed and to verify whether clustering of focal adhesion components into focal adhesions actually controlled cell motility , we next deactivated cell components that had not previously been reported as regulators of focal adhesions or cell migration . Here we used rotenone , which inhibits mitochondrial complexes by interfer - ing with electron transport chain in the mitochon - dria ( 40 ) , and bleomycin , which disrupts cell cycle by forming free radicals that break DNA strands and inhibiting thymidine incorporation into DNA ( 41 , 42 ) . Cells treated with these drugs simultaneously reduced focal adhesion size and cell speed in accor - dance to the primary data set ( Fig . 5 D , green and purple ; E – G ) . To test the robustness of the above relationship between focal adhesions and cell migration , we merged the primary data set ( Supplemental Fig . S2 A , B ) based on the depletion of focal adhesion components and changes in substrate compliance with the blind test results ( Supplemental Fig . S3 A , B ) generated by the depletion of (cid:11) - actinin on stiff and soft substrates , the disruption of F - actin , the deactivation of mitochondria , and the inhibition of cell cycle through release of free radicals ( data summarized in Supplemental Fig . S3 and Fig . 4 ) . The functional relationships obtained from the primary data set were remarkably well maintained , even after addition of the validating tests ( Supplemental Figs . S2 vs .

I ) Schematic of cell speed prediction by focal adhesion size . Regardless of the type of cell disturbance , focal adhesion size directly predicts cell speed . 9 FOCAL ADHESION SIZE UNIQUELY PREDICTS CELL MIGRATION discussed so far ( Supplemental Fig . 3 C ) . A tight bipha - sic relationship between focal adhesion size and cell speed was maintained in human cancer cells ( r 2 (cid:2) 0 . 83 , Fig . 5 H ) . Together , these results reveal that the mean size of focal adhesions is highly predictive of cell migration speed ; i . e . , any observed change in cell speed following a modulation of a known or unknown regulator of cell migration can be quantitatively predicted by a change in the mean size of focal adhesions in these cells ( see schematic , Fig . 5 I ) . DISCUSSION The existence of a robustly predictive , functional rela - tionship between cell migration and focal adhesions has not been previously established . Prior to this work , disparate observations across cell types ( e . g . , fast - mov - ing Dictyostelium discoideum and neutrophils vs . slowly moving ﬁbroblasts ) suggested an inverse relation be - tween focal adhesion size and cell migration speed ( 14 , 44 , 45 ) . In contrast , our results reveal that cell speed largely changes biphasically with focal adhesion size . More precisely , MEF speed steadily increases with focal adhesion size , until a threshold value of (cid:10) 0 . 7 ( corre - sponding to (cid:10) 2 . 6 (cid:3) m 2 ) in normalized focal adhesion size ( Figs . 3 G and 5 G ) beyond which cell speed de - clines . The late stage is mainly due to the FAK - depleted cells whose focal adhesions outgrew and thus cell motility was retarded . This result is in concordance with a previous study showing that inhibition of FAK activity decreased focal adhesion turnover and signiﬁcantly reduced cell speed ( 44 , 46 ) . In previous studies ( 15 , 16 , 47 ) , cell migration speed biphasically changed depending on the adhesion strength between cell and underlying substrates where ligand density was referred to the adhesion strength and biphasic behavior of cell speed was observed when plotted to the logarithmic scale of the adhesion strength . This may suggest that adhesion strength in - creases nonlinearly with focal adhesion size . Initially focal adhesion molecules nucleate and grow in size , where adhesion strength rapidly increases to the avail - able maximum value , but adhesion strength might not be further increased even though apparent size of focal adhesions keeps growing , and this focal adhesion en - ters the decaying phase , where the size of focal adhe - sions would progressively decrease due to the dissipa - tion of focal adhesion molecules . This notion is supported by the ﬁnding that adhesion strength in - creases nonlinearly with adhesive area controlled by micropatterned adhesive island size ( 48 ) . Changes in focal adhesion size seem to serve as a necessary funnel through which intracellular or extra - cellular disturbances ( including changes in substrate compliance , depletion of focal adhesion proteins , dis - ruption of cytoskeleton , deactivation of nonfocal adhe - sion proteins , e . g . , mitochondria , inhibition of cell cycle , etc . ) have to go through to regulate cell speed ( Fig . 5 I ) . Future work will determine whether the characteristic correlation between focal adhesion pro - tein clustering and cell migration speed demonstrated in this study applies to cells in settings of different dimensionality , such as cancers cells fully embedded in a three - dimensional extracellular matrix ( 12 , 43 ) .
