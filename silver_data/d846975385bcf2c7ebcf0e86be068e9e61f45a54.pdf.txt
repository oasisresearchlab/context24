Open Access Movement Ecology Movement predictability of individual barn owls facilitates estimation of home range size and survival Shlomo Cain 1† , Tovale Solomon 1† , Yossi Leshem 1 , Sivan Toledo 2 , Eitam Arnon 1 , Alexandre Roulin 3 and Orr Spiegel 1 * Abstract Background There is growing attention to individuality in movement , its causes and consequences . Similarly to other well - established personality traits ( e . g . , boldness or sociability ) , conspecifics also differ repeatedly in their spatial behaviors , forming behavioral types ( “spatial - BTs” ) . These spatial - BTs are typically described as the difference in the mean - level among individuals , and the intra - individual variation ( IIV , i . e . , predictability ) is only rarely considered . Furthermore , the factors determining predictability or its ecological consequences for broader space - use patterns are largely unknown , in part because predictability was mostly tested in captivity ( e . g . , with repeated boldness assays ) . Here we test if ( i ) individuals differ in their movement and specifically in their predictability . We then investigate ( ii ) the consequences of this variation for home - range size and survival estimates , and ( iii ) the factors that affect individual predictability . Methods We tracked 92 barn owls ( Tyto alba ) with an ATLAS system and monitored their survival . From these high - resolution ( every few seconds ) and extensive trajectories ( 115 . 2 ± 112 . 1 nights ; X ̅ ± SD ) we calculated movement and space - use indices ( e . g . , max - displacement and home - range size , respectively ) . We then used double - hierarchical and generalized linear mix - models to assess spatial - BTs , individual predictability in nightly max - displacement , and its consistency across time . Finally , we explored if predictability levels were associated with home - range size and survival , as well as the seasonal , geographical , and demographic factors affecting it ( e . g . , age , sex , and owls’ density ) . Results Our dataset ( with 74 individuals after filtering ) revealed clear patterns of individualism in owls’ movement . Individuals differed consistently both in their mean movement ( e . g . , max - displacement ) and their IIV around it ( i . e . , predictability ) . More predictable individuals had smaller home - ranges and lower survival rates , on top and beyond the expected effects of their spatial - BT ( max - displacement ) , sex , age and ecological environments . Juveniles were less predictable than adults , but the sexes did not differ in their predictability . Conclusion These results demonstrate that individual predictability may act as an overlooked axis of spatial - BT with potential implications for relevant ecological processes at the population level and individual fitness . Considering how individuals differ in their IIV of movement beyond the mean - effect can facilitate understanding the intraspecific diversity , predicting their responses to changing ecological conditions and their population management . † Shlomo Cain and Tovale Solomon contributed equally to the paper * Correspondence : Orr Spiegel orrspiegel @ tauex . tau . ac . il Full list of author information is available at the end of the article Page 2 of 17 Cain et al . Movement Ecology ( 2023 ) 11 : 10 Keywords Animal personality , Behavioral plasticity , Behavioral syndromes , Bio - telemetry , Double - hierarchical generalized linear model ( DHGLM ) , High - throughput tracking , Movement ecology Introduction Animal movement reflects the interaction between an individual’s needs and its changing environment and directly impacts its fitness and central ecological pro - cesses , such as foraging and dispersal [ 1 , 2 ] . Movement patterns show remarkable diversity across different scales , varying among species , populations , individuals , and also within individuals across time [ 3 – 5 ] . Differ - ences in movement among conspecifics are often related to environmental heterogeneity ( e . g . , in resource dis - tribution ) , demographic factors ( e . g . , sex and age ) , and short - term behavioral states ( e . g . , hunger level ; [ 6 – 9 ] ) . In addition to these well - established factors , there is a growing attention to individuality in movement and its influence on ecological patterns and population response to changing conditions . Yet , despite a surplus of recent studies , the patterns of individuality and their conse - quences remain relatively understudied [ 10 – 14 ] . Studies in behavioral ecology have long - established the framework and tools to quantify consistency in individual behaviors , and the existence of animal personalities ( aka temperament or behavioral types ; hereafter BTs ) in traits such as boldness , exploration and sociability [ 15 , 16 ] . More recently , accumulating evidence demonstrates that individuals are also repeatable in their movement and spatial behaviors , forming “spatial - BTs” [ 10 , 17 ] . Exam - ples include repeatable home - range behaviors [ 18 , 19 ] , habitat use [ 20 , 21 ] , or finer - scale movement indices like maximal daily displacement [ 22 , 23 ] . The growing inter - est in spatial - BTs is driven in part by the ever - improving ability to track more individuals at better resolution and accuracy , providing enough data on sufficient sample size to dissect the contribution of among - individual variation from other factors like background environments [ 24 ] . These rich datasets , in turn , can reveal the impact of fine - scale movements on social interactions , disease transmis - sion and other behaviors that may influence fitness and population dynamics and ultimately the ability of species to adapt to environmental changes [ 25 – 27 ] . Despite the above - mentioned immense progress in describing spatial - BTs , this is mostly done as the differ - ence in the mean level among individuals ( e . g . , [ 17 , 19 , 23 ] ) . Differences among individuals in their intra - indi - vidual variation ( IIV ) have been thoroughly discussed for other behaviors ( e . g . , boldness ; [ 28 ] ) but are rarely considered in movement studies . IIV is often termed individual unpredictability [ 28 – 30 ] . It is defined as the residuals in a measured behavior after accounting for the among - individual differences in their mean response ( i . e . , intercepts ) , and for the plasticity of their response to environmental gradients ( i . e . slopes , which may also differ among individuals ; [ 28 , 30 – 32 ] ) . For instance , Stamps et al . [ 28 ] repeatedly assayed the bold - ness ( latency to emerge after disturbance ) of hermit crabs ( Pagurus bernhardus ) . They found that individ - ual crabs differed in their mean level and had a plastic response of diminishing trend ( habituation ) . Yet indi - viduals also differed in their predictability around the individual - specific expected level : some were predict - ably closer to the expected trend while others showed high IIV around the trend - line . Broadly speaking , predictability usually increases ( IIV decreases ) with age or experience ( sometimes referred to as canalization ; [ 33 ] ) . Predictability may also vary between sexes , depending on the species’ natural his - tory . Both predictability and plasticity can be regarded as axes of BT if individuals are stable over time . Quanti - fying predictability ( IIV ) requires repeated assessments of the behavior in mind . Hence , most studies on this topic were done in captivity ( e . g . , [ 33 ] or [ 34 ] ) . Despite the methodological advantages of captive - assays , this approach is limiting the ability to link observed dif - ferences in predictability with their in - situ ecological consequences for individual fitness , space use , and ulti - mately population dynamics [ 35 ] . Exploring predict - ability in movement behavior can overcome these cons and offers a suitable alternative approach . Biologging datasets may provide the required large samples of repeated measures per individual ( e . g . , daily routines ; [ 24 , 36 ] ) with a balanced design and large sample sizes across individuals . Studies by Cleasby et al . [ 37 ] and Hertel and Niemela [ 38 ] also provide a methodological route to test predictability in move - ment by double - hierarchical generalized linear mod - els ( DHGLMs ) that simultaneously capture individual variation in intercept ( behavioral type ) , slope ( behav - ioral plasticity ) , and residual variance ( predictability ) . Recent work by Hertel and colleagues [ 38 , 39 ] suggests that highly predictable individuals coexist along with unpredictable individuals within the same population , and that predictability may co - vary with movement rate creating a movement syndrome ( sensu ; [ 23 ] ) that may have potential ecological impacts . Ideally , quantifying predictability in movement indi - ces requires large datasets with multiple individuals simultaneously tracked at high resolution over long Page 3 of 17 Cain et al . Movement Ecology ( 2023 ) 11 : 10 periods ( thus experiencing relatively similar external conditions ) [ 32 ] . Indeed , empirical in situ examples are still particularly rare , at least in part due to these data requirements . Thus , it is still unknown whether spatial - BTs differ also in their predictability ( or just in the mean trait ) , and if the predictability is potentially another relevant spatial - BT axis . Further , to the best of our knowledge , none of the previous examples tested if predictability in movement is associated with other ecological properties , such as broad - scale space - use patterns or fitness proxies ( as was done for predict - ability of other behaviors ; [ 35 ] ) . Similarly , it remains unknown if age and other plausible predictors ( like sex , and environmental conditions ) influence predict - ability in movement , as was shown for other behaviors ( [ 33 ] and reference therein ) . This sets the ground for broadening the axes of individual variation by explor - ing also consistent differences among individuals in their movement predictability . To address these gaps , we focused on a population of barn owls ( Tyto alba ) . This nocturnal predator plays a key role as a pest control agent in agricultural areas [ 40 ] . Accordingly , barn owls’ natural history has been relatively well described [ 41 ] , and their high reliance on nest boxes ( which allow farmers to boost owls’ local population in areas where natural nests are lim - ited ; [ 40 ] ) along with ongoing monitoring facilitates captures and tracking . We have used high - resolution tracking data to quantify owls’ predictability and its ecological consequences . Specifically , we ask three broad questions ( followed by corresponding hypoth - eses ) . First , what are the patterns of among - individual variation in movement ? We hypothesize that [ H1 . 1 ] individuals differ consistently in their movement pat - terns ( i . e . , showing a spatial - BTs in their mean lev - els ) ; that [ H1 . 2 ] they also differ in their predictability ( IIV around the mean ) ; and that [ H1 . 3 ] these vary - ing levels of predictability are repeatable across time ( i . e . , an individual that was relatively predictable over period A will be relatively predictable over period B ; e . g . , [ 35 ] ) . Second , we ask what are the ecological con - sequences of predictability ? Since BTs are known to affect broader space use patterns and fitness [ 10 , 42 ] , we hypothesize that predictability may be associated with both [ H2 . 1 ] home - range size and [ H2 . 2 ] indi - vidual survival . Lastly , we ask what factors affect the predictability of individuals ? We hypothesize that beyond possible effects of environmental factors ( e . g . local density ) , [ H3 . 1 ] age and sex will co - vary with this index , as was shown in several previous examples ( lim - ited mostly to captive behavioral assays in controlled environments ; [ 33 , 38 , 43 ] ) . Methods Study species The barn owl ( Tyto alba ) is a medium - sized bird ( length 33 – 39 cm ; wingspan 80 – 95 cm ) from the Tytonidae fam - ily , with a cosmopolitan distribution [ 41 ] . It is known as a generalist top predator , which feeds almost exclusively on small mammals located in agricultural fields and open grasslands . At the same time , as secondary cavity breed - ers , barn owls are limited by the availability of suitable sites in these habitats . As a result , they tend to breed in man - made structures ( e . g . , barns , farmhouses , and ruins ) —as their name indicates . Barn owls have a remarkable breeding capacity . They lay large clutches ranging from 2 to 11 ( e . g . , ~ 4 . 6 fledg - lings in Israel ; [ 44 ] ) . The laying interval is about two to three days , with asynchronous hatching ( i . e . , the female starts incubation as soon as the first egg has been laid ) resulting in substantial age differences within the brood . Eggs require , on average , 32 days ( range 27 – 36 days ) of incubation . Hence , the overall incubation period var - ies from 34 for up to 59 days ( 32 for incubation of first egg + 27 days of within clutch delays ) for clutches of 11 chicks . During incubation , the female usually remains inside the nest cavity , while the male provides her food requirements . When all eggs are hatched ( typically about two weeks after the first one is hatched ) , the female starts leaving the nest more regularly . Fledglings leave the nest for the first time at approximately the age of 55 days [ 45 ] , but the parental care extends for ~ 30 more days [ 46 ] . In Israel , eggs are laid around March ( extending from Janu - ary to June ; [ 44 ] ) , and pairs can sometimes raise up to two broods annually [ 47 ] . Study system The study was conducted at the Harod valley ( 32° 30’ N 35° 29’ E ) , north - eastern Israel . This valley is domi - nated by intensive agricultural landscapes ( field crops , orchards , banana plantations and fishponds ) , and holds a few rural settlements . Over the last three decades , local farmers deployed dozens of nesting boxes for barn owls ` usage in agricultural fields throughout the area . This effort enhances owls’ resident population and their biological service of rodents control [ 40 ] . This ongoing agro - ecological project includes monitoring nest - boxes ( every breeding season ) and diurnal owl captures ( while roosting ) by blocking the nest - box door . Captured owls are banded with metal rings for individual identification , aged and measured for standard measurements ( wing length and body mass ) . In addition to this ongoing moni - toring , from December 2019 to February 2022 , we fitted tracking devices ( hereafter tags ) to adults and fledglings ( wing > 280 mm ) in good body condition ( a total of 94 Page 4 of 17 Cain et al . Movement Ecology ( 2023 ) 11 : 10 owls ) . Tags were attached with a Teflon harness in a back - pack or leg - loop configuration ( total weight of the device and harness was 13 ± 1 g ; < 4 . 3 % of the body mass in all cases ; Fig . 1 ) . Sex was determined for these individuals with genetic kits on feathers samples ( Karnieli - Vet Ltd . , Kiryat Tiv’on , Israel ) . All trapping and tagging procedures were author - ized by permits 2019 / 42155 and 2020 / 42502 from Israel Nature and Parks Authority . The ATLAS tracking system We have used an ATLAS wildlife tracking system to address our hypotheses . In addition to the animal - borne tags , the ATLAS system includes a set of ground stations with tower - mounted antennas and central data - processing and storage servers [ 48 – 50 ] . The sys - tem uses a reverse - GPS approach ( i . e . , localizations are estimated from data received by the stations whose coordinates are known and not through onboard cal - culations by the tags themselves ) . Tags transmit radio signals with unique tag - IDs at 1 / 4 or 1 / 8 Hz ( depending on settings ) and these are received by ground stations . If three or more ground stations successfully receive a given signal , then the tags’ location is computed at high accuracy ( ideally about ± 5 m ; [ 50 , 51 ] ) , from the times of arrival of the signals . The use of ground stations lim - its the coverage to a particular region ( whereas GPS offers global coverage ) , but this is acceptable for studies of barn owls that largely remain local . Such an approach allows tags to be inexpensive , lightweight , and bat - tery efficient , compared to other alternatives ( e . g . , GPS where the tag localizes itself ) , providing many more data points per gram . These features make the sys - tem particularly effective in collecting high resolution and accurate data for many individuals over extended periods ( months - years ) and hence appropriate for Fig . 1 The upper - left panel shows an owl equipped with an ATLAS tag in backpack configuration . The middle left panel shows four fledglings in a nest box . The main panel shows the nightly trajectories of five independent owls ( not the same ones as above ) over one night in January 2022 and the insets show the regional and national location of the study site at the Harod Valley , Israel Page 5 of 17 Cain et al . Movement Ecology ( 2023 ) 11 : 10 investigating individual variation in movement patterns and predictability . Data analysis and statistical methods Filtering and processing All data analyses were done in the R environment [ 52 ] with Rstudio [ 53 ] . To ensure data quality we applied sev - eral data filtering and segmentation steps . First , follow - ing a previously described pipeline [ 54 ] , we filtered out points with low system - accuracy estimate ( STD > 50 m ) or with non - realistic speed - line > 15 m s − 1 . Second , to reflect the owl’s nocturnal activity , the data was seg - mented into nights , starting at 5 p . m . and ending at 6 : 00 a . m . Daytime data was excluded , and nights were used as the base unit for all further analyses . Third , we computed the nightly movement indices ( see below ) only if tracking provided sufficient data points ( more than 1000 points per night ) . Fourth , our data ( female static behavior , chick ages using wing length of the oldest fledg - ling in the nest ; [ 55 ] ) allows us to back - calculate the start and end dates of the incubation period for each female and hatching dates for the fledglings . We excluded incu - bation periods from female movement analysis and con - sidered the transition from fledgling to adult at the age of one year . Fifth , because barn owl behavior and movement patterns change drastically along the year , we divided the data into three periods , representing different stages in the owls’ reproductive cycle and seasonality ( 1st - period : Feb – May , incubating / nesting period ; 2nd - period : Jun – Sep , rearing / post - breeding period ; and 3rd - period : Oct – Jan , fall - winter time ) . We then calculated movement indices for each period excluding owls with less than 25 nights in a given period . The latter two steps reduce potential biases caused by individuals leaving our site , or age - dependent dispersal . Several movement indices are conceivable for quanti - fying individual consistency , such as the nightly total - distance ( i . e . , the sum of all movements / flight segments in the night ) , trajectory openness and others [ see 36 , this volume ] . To minimize the influence of location errors during stops , we segmented the trajectories ( i . e . , the daily tracks ) by their activity mode , move ( i . e . , fly ) or stop segments , and estimated total distance for moving segments only . These indices were computed using the AdpFixedPoint function from R - package toolsFo - rAtlas . For simplicity , we focus here on results from the nightly max - displacement as the main index of move - ment , defined as the distance between the first point of the night ( typically the nest box ) to the most distant point in the nightly trajectory . This distance is both very commonly used , and robust to minute differences in the sampling interval . Estimating individual repeatability To test our initial hypothesis regarding consistent indi - vidual variation in movement [ H1 . 1 ] , we calculated repeatability ( Rp ) using Nakagawa and Schielzeth [ 56 ] , as the proportion of the total variance accounted for by dif - ferences among individuals . In addition to repeatability , we also report the coefficient of variation for among - indi - vidual variance ( CVi ) , calculated as the among - individual variance standardized by the trait mean . Both repeatabil - ity and CVi are population - level estimates of the degree of individual variation , with CVi suggested as a more robust estimate [ 38 ] . Individuals may differ in their average nightly max - dis - placement ( flying near or far ) and also in their variability around their mean . Some individuals are unpredictable and are producing a broad range of nightly movement ranges , whereas more predictable individuals are nar - rowly centered around their own average ( Fig . 2 ) . We measured individual predictability [ H1 . 2 ] by estimating variation in residual intra - individual variation ( rIIV ) , i . e . , the spread of residuals around an individual reac - tion norm ( after accounting for differences in both intercept and slope ) following the protocol of Cleasby et al . [ 37 ] and Hertel et al . [ 38 ] . We used the R - package brms [ 57 ] to fit a double - hierarchical generalized lin - ear model ( DHGLM ) to our datasets with nightly max - displacement as a response variable . Individuals with a high residual variance in the DHGLMs are accordingly more unpredictable than individuals with a low residual variance . When necessary for biological interpretation of rIIV values we back - transformed them to the original scale ( km ) by taking the exponent of its logged values from the DHGLM outputs . Finally , to determine whether individual predictability is consistent across time ( H1 . 3 ; e . g . , [ 35 ] ) , we calculated period - specific predictability values and established indi - vidual consistency also in this aspect , similarly to the cal - culation of repeatability and CVi of max - displacement . Then , we established the ecological relevance of indi - vidual predictability for broad topics in movement ecol - ogy by exploring the predictive power of this index on home - range ( HR ) estimates [ H2 . 1 ] and survival [ H2 . 2 ] , on top and beyond commonly investigated indices of age , sex , mean max - displacement and geographical factors ( detailed below ) that might affect the movement . Home‑range analysis We estimated the owls’ HR ( the area used by an indi - vidual for its routine activities ; [ 58 ] ) for each period . We quantified the utility distribution function of each indi - vidual’s space - use using the auto - correlated kernel den - sity estimate ( akde ; [ 58 ] ) from the R - package ctmm [ 59 ] . Page 6 of 17 Cain et al . Movement Ecology ( 2023 ) 11 : 10 This method is explicitly suitable for estimating these parameters from high - resolution movement data , as available here . Due to the function’s long running time over our huge dataset ( with tens of millions of points ) , for this analysis we have subsampled the data at a 10 min interval . Further , in order to represent the HR as loca - tions where the owl actually chooses to stand ( e . g . , perch or rest ) and not places where it flies through , we have used only the segments of activity mode identified as stops ( and not flight ) , as described above . An individual of unknown sex and an individual whose HR model did not converge were excluded from this analysis . We extracted the locations of HR centers ( available from the ctmm output ) and used these to explore the influence of geographical position on the HR size . Spe - cifically , we included four factors : the center coordinates ( longitude , latitude ) , ground elevation and its distance from the system’s center ( to eliminate possible bias in our tracking dataset ) . Lastly , we also tested the effect of owls’ population density on the dependent variables using an index of the number of occupied boxes within a radius of 1 . 7 km ( the median HR’s radius ) along the study years . This index provides a robust density estimate that reflects the massive agro - ecological project and is not biased by our sampling efforts of the focal tracking . To explore the effect of predictability on HR size [ H2 . 1 ] while accounting for other factors , we compared a set of linear mixed effect models ( lmer function from R - pack - age lme4 ; [ 60 ] ) . All models included Log ( HR ) as the dependent variable ( for a given period ) and individual’s ID as a random effect . We ran a preliminary analysis that included the following fixed effects ( varied among mod - els ) : Three categorical factors : age ( adult vs . juvenile ) , sex , and period ; and four continuous fixed effects ( standard - ized before inclusion ) : the tracking duration ( number of nights ) within the period , mean max - displacement , mean total - distance and mean rIIV ( index of predictability of max - displacement ) . We checked for collinearity among fixed effects and considered models with most possible combinations , excluding a few models with singular - ity issues . Models were then ranked with the corrected Akaike information criterion ( AICc ) using R - package AICcmodavg [ 61 ] . After establishing the top three mod - els ( Delta _ AICc ≤ 4 . 3 ) we also explored whether the geo - graphical factors ( Coordinates , elevation , distance from the ATLAS center ) and / or the local owl density improve the models of HR size . A models ranking was conducted again . Prediction plots from the top model were then generated with the R - package effects [ 62 ] . Survival analysis For testing our hypothesis that predictability affects survival [ H2 . 1 ] , beyond the effects of age , sex , and max - displacement we modeled survival using Cox hazard regression [ 63 , 64 ] . This method is commonly used for investigating the effect of several variables upon the time a specified event ( in our case , death ) takes to happen . The coefficients in a Cox regression relate to hazard ; a posi - tive coefficient indicates a worse prognosis and a negative coefficient indicates a protective effect of the associated variable . An individual’s fate at the end of the tracking is logged as a “censored” status ( live or unknown ) or “dead” . Fig . 2 A demonstration of different predictability values . A Nightly maximal displacement of two individuals over three weeks during August 2021 . While the two individuals have similar average max - displacement , they differ strongly in their predictability values . One individual ( red ) has highly consistent distances ( ~ 2 . 6 km every day ) , and the other ( blue ) varies substantially in its nightly movement range , alternating between nights of short distances and nights of up to ~ 15 km . B and C Maps showing the trajectories ( black line ) and relevant nightly max - displacement distances ( colored red and blue lines , respectively ) for eight nights within this period ( marked in black dash on panel A ) of predictable individual ( B ) and unpredictable individual ( C ) Page 7 of 17 Cain et al . Movement Ecology ( 2023 ) 11 : 10 We implemented this regression with coxph ( R - package survival ; [ 65 , 66 ] ) , and used the function ggforest ( R - package survminer ; [ 67 ] ) to present results for the model as a ‘Forest’ plot . Various individuals died during the study ( N = 22 out of 74 owls ) , many of them through collision with cars , a well - documented mortality factor of barn owls around the world [ 41 , 68 , 69 ] . We included mean max displace - ment , mean rIIV , sex , age group ( classified as juvenile or adult for each individual ) and total tracking duration ( days until last known status ) as predictors of survival in the model . Five individuals that transitioned between age groups during the tracking period were considered separately for each group ( i . e . , surviving for one year as a juvenile , and then according to their adult fate ) . Since our regression model does not account for the repeated measures of these five individuals , we repeated the anal - ysis using mixed effects Cox hazard regression model ( coxme ; [ 70 ] ) . This latter version ( with ring - ID used as a random factor ) resulted in very similar results to that of the simple regression described above ( see Additional file 1 : Tables S1 and S2 ) , and for simplicity , we present here only the simpler model . Factors affecting predictability For testing our third hypothesis regarding the fac - tors affecting individual predictability , we have mod - eled rIIV ( unpredictability ) as a function of age group , sex , year , and period . We also accounted for the effect of local density and geographic variables ( latitude , lon - gitude , elevation , distance from center ) by considering these in the models , along with the tracking duration . We constructed generalized linear mixed - model with an individual’s ID as a random factor and all possible combi - nations of these fixed effects using the function dredge ( R - package MuMIn ; [ 71 ] ) . We ranked the models accord - ing to their AICc values and investigated the effect size of the relevant models . Finally , to further validate this mod - eling approach we also modeled the predictors affecting rIIV ( the residuals of the model ) directly into a DHGLM . These models showed the same qualitative results as the simpler models described above ( see Appendix ) . Results We obtained data for 92 different individuals during 2019 – 2021 , with a tracking duration of 115 . 2 ± 112 . 1 ( X ̅ ± SD ; range : 1 – 570 ) nights per individual , and a total of over 10 , 600 nightly trajectories ( containing > 58 × 10 6 ATLAS fixes ) . After data filtering and excluding birds with insufficient data per period , our dataset includes 128 periods - bird combinations with 74 different individu - als and an average of 1 . 7 ± 1 . 0 ( range : 1 – 5 ) periods per individual . These birds include 45 females and 29 males of which 34 are adults and 45 are juveniles ( five individu - als transitioned from juvenile to adult during the track - ing period ) . See Additional file 1 : Tables S3 and S4 for full details . Barn owls typically start their nocturnal activity at their central roosting site ( often a next box ) and use sev - eral perching points along the night before returning to their day roost . They pass a nightly distance ( i . e . , a ‘total distance’ ) of 11 . 82 ± 7 . 73 km ( range : 2 . 26 – 51 . 89 ) , with maximal displacement ( i . e . , a bee - line distance from the starting point to the most distant point in the night ) of 2 . 45 ± 0 . 93 km ( range : 0 . 56 – 5 . 41 km ) . Season has a strong effect on barn owls’ movement . During the breed - ing season , owls act as central place foragers , frequently returning to the nest to provide for the incubating female ( the males ) and later for the chicks ( both parents , males often more intensively than females ) . After fledging and a short flight - learning period juveniles had longer dis - tances compared to adults , and males show longer dis - tances compared to females ( one - way ANOVA , F df = 3 = 8 . 97 , p < 0 . 001 ; see Additional file 1 : Fig . S1 ) . Individual variation in barn owl movement In agreement with our hypothesis [ H1 . 1 ] , barn owls show a significant individualism in their max - displacement with repeatability of Rp = 0 . 228 [ 0 . 158 , 0 . 297 ; confidence interval ] and coefficient of variation for among - individ - ual variance ( CVi ) = 0 . 362 [ 0 . 303 , 0 . 426 ] . Individuals also differ in their overall predictability estimates ( Fig . 3 ) . Period - specific predictability values ( for birds tracked Fig . 3 Posterior estimates for individual predictability in distances of nightly max - displacement across the entire tracking duration . Higher values of rIIV ( X - axis ) indicate lower predictability in the behavior . Each line on the y - axis corresponds to a different individual , sorted by their mean rIIV . The most predictable individual has an average residual variance of 0 . 35 km around its behavioral mean , whereas the least predictable individual has an average residual variance of 5 . 16 km , resulting in a very flat distribution with a high mean value . Dark color indicates adults while light color indicates juvenile birds and the apparent trend that adults are much more predictable than juveniles is supported by subsequent models , see below Page 8 of 17 Cain et al . Movement Ecology ( 2023 ) 11 : 10 in more than one period ) reveal that also this trait is strongly repeatable for each individual ( i . e . , an individual that was predictable in period A was similarly predictable on period B ) , with repeatability estimated as Rp = 0 . 424 [ 0 . 185 , 0 . 638 ] . These results were not limited to the index of max - displacement , we found quantitatively simi - lar patterns also for the index of nightly ‘total distances’ , with repeatable values and varying predictability among individuals ( Additional file 1 : Table S5 ) . Overall , these findings support our second [ H1 . 2 ] and third [ H1 . 3 ] hypotheses regarding rIIV values being consistent indi - vidual traits , and below we turn to explore the ecological consequences of this variation and the factors that affect it . The ecological consequences of predictability in movement Individual predictability is related to its HR size Ranking models for HR size shows that all top models ( top eleven models with a cumulative weight of 0 . 98 ) , which reliably explain the data , include our index of pre - dictability ( rIIV ) , together with age , period , mean max - displacement , and tracking duration ( Additional file 1 : Table S6 ) . The influence of the geographic factors and density on rIIV is limited , and these predictors were not included in the top model , only appearing in some of the following models ( e . g . , 2nd to 5th models , cumula - tive weight of 0 . 46 ; Additional file 1 : Table S6 ) . Accord - ingly , model - averaged effects for the HR size shows that both Max displacement and rIIV had the strongest effect , while the geographical variables had negligible effects . Similarly , HR sizes differed among periods , with larger sizes during rearing / post - breeding season and fall - winter compared to the incubating / nesting HRs , when individu - als are bounded to their respective nests ( Table 1 ) . Focusing on predicted effect sizes ( Additional file 1 : Table S7 , Fig . 4 ) from the leading model demonstrates that—in agreement with our hypothesis [ H2 . 1 ] —the predictability per se has a major effect on HR size , inde - pendent of all other considered factors . Expectedly , max - displacement ( Fig . 4A ) has the strongest effect on HR , with individuals moving further at the nightly scale having also large HR at the longer scale of a full period . More surprising is the strong effect of predictability ( Fig . 4B ) , which equals to about a half of the former effect of the max - displacement . The positive effect indicates that individuals with higher rIIV ( less predictable ) have larger HRs . Also age has an expected effect with juve - nile barn owls having larger HR than adults ( Fig . 4C ) . Periods differed as well ( Fig . 4D ) , with HR size in the 1st period ( Feb - May ; breeding season ) being lower com - pared to 2nd ( Jun - Sep , rearing / post - breeding period ) and 3rd ( Oct - Jan , fall - winter time ) periods ( with no clear difference among the latter two ) . Sex ( lower ranked models ) and tracking duration ( which we included in all models ; Additional file 1 : Table S6 ; Fig . 4E ) had very weak effects on HR size . The latter result reflects our conserva - tive minimal inclusion criteria ( at least 25 tracking nights per period ) . This was chosen to ensure tracks are long enough to reflect individual - period space - use and avoid a methodological bias . Notably , although total distance was included as a possible fixed effect in various mod - els within the set , it was not highly ranked and is absent from all leading models . Individual predictability is related to its survival In agreement with the hypothesis that survival will be related with predictability [ H2 . 2 ] , we find that rIIV of max - displacement is negatively and significantly asso - ciated with risk level in the Cox hazard regression . This negative effect means that individuals with higher rIIV values ( i . e . , less predictable ) seem to survive longer , while more predictable individuals ( lower rIIV values ) are more prone to mortality ( Fig . 5 ; Additional file 1 : Table S1 ) . None of the other predictors ( sex , age group , max dis - placement , tracking duration per period ) significantly affected regression results and owls’ survival . While age - dependent diminishing mortality risk is commonly observed in many biological systems—barn owls included [ 72 ] —this general pattern is only weakly Table 1 Model - averaged coefficients for fixed effects included in models predicting HR size of barn owls Reference categories for categorical variables were Adult ( age group ) , Female ( sex ) and Period 1 ( tracking periods ) .

Movement Ecology ( 2023 ) 11 : 10 reflected in our data . Juveniles showed a ( non - significant ) trend toward higher hazard compared to adults ( the ref - erence category ) and this modeling result is also reflected in actual mortality rates ( 10 / 33 adults vs . 12 / 46 juveniles died during the study ) . Presumably , two factors may con - tribute to this relatively high adult mortality : first , dis - persing juveniles readily leave the region ( resulting in ‘censored’ status ) . Indeed , tracking duration for juveniles was marginally shorter than for adults ( 127 . 9 ± 92 . 7 vs . 172 ± 112 . 3 , respectively ; T df = 60 . 6 = 1 . 84 , p = 0 . 06 ) . Sec - ond , anthropogenic factors ( mostly collisions with cars ) that are disproportionately hitting adults ( 66 % of car hits were of adults although they were only 42 % of tracked individuals ) , presumably since they engage in more intensive foraging while providing chicks compared to juveniles that have no dependents . Factors affecting individual predictability Our last hypothesis [ H3 . 1 ] that predictability depends on age and sex was only partially supported . The data show that rIIV depends on max - displacement and the age group ( Fig . 6 ) , with barn owls becoming predictable with age ( aka ‘behavioral canalization’ ) . A direct com - parison reveals that juveniles are less predictable than adults with an average value of rIIV of 2 . 25 ± 0 . 83 km versus 1 . 23 ± 0 . 59 km . In contrast to our expectation , sex did not affect rIIV , and females and males have average rIIV values of 1 . 74 ± 0 . 81 km and 1 . 98 ± 1 . 02 km , respec - tively ( two - way ANOVA for sex F df = 1 = 1 . 57 , p = 0 . 21 ; and for age F df = 1 = 44 . 05 , p < 0 . 001 ) . This basic result is also supported by model comparison , showing that 21 models gained sufficient support ( Delta _ AICc < 4 ; Addi - tional file 1 : Table S8 ; out of the 1024 model combination considered ) . Age was included in all of these models and was the only predictor which significantly affected rIIV ( 0 . 856 ± 0 . 166 , p < 0 . 001 ; Table 2 ) , implying that barn owls become more predictable as they mature . Year and eleva - tion had some support for an effect on rIIV ( 0 . 22 ± 0 . 21 and 0 . 13 ± 0 . 14 , respectively ; Table 2 ) , but weaker and not significant . All other predictors ( e . g . , latitude , lon - gitude , period , density and sex ) had practically no effect ( all < 0 . 1 ; Additional file 1 : Table S9 ) .

Movement Ecology ( 2023 ) 11 : 10 Discussion In this study , we have tested individuality and predict - ability in barn owl movement . We have tracked barn owls at high resolution over extended periods ( fixes every few seconds , tracks of several months ) via the cutting - edge ATLAS system . This rich dataset included 74 individu - als and revealed clear patterns of individualism in move - ment . Individuals differed consistently from each other both in their mean movement indices ( max - displace - ment , total distance ) and in their residual intra - individual variation ( rIIV ) , a measure of ( un ) predictability . Some individuals were highly predictable while others were more variable around their mean nightly movement , and this trait was repeatable across periods ( 4 months - long sessions used in our analyses ) . Importantly , these two axes of spatial behavioral types ( BTs , namely mean move - ment and predictability level ) are not only distinguishing different conspecifics , but they are also associated with apparent ecological consequences : more predictable indi - viduals ( low rIIV ) have smaller home - ranges ( HRs ) and lower survival rate . The effects of predictability on HR and survival are above - and - beyond the commonly stud - ied effects of an individual’s max - displacement ( positively affecting HR size ) , age ( juveniles have larger HR but simi - lar survival in our dataset ) , sex ( no strong effect on HR or survival ) and several indices of the local environment ( e . g . , elevation , coordinates and local density ) . We also found that age explained some of the differences among individuals’ predictability , with juveniles being largely less predictable than adults , while neither sex nor the local environment strongly affected individuals’ predictability . To the best of our knowledge , these links are largely under - explored in the literature of movement ecology . Indeed , there is a growing recognition in the importance of spatial - BTs for various ecological properties [ 10 , 17 , 23 ] , yet only a few studies have quantified the predict - ability of individuals in their movement patterns over time in natural settings ( e . g . , [ 38 ] ) . Further , almost none has shown that predictability can actually relate ( or even influence ) broader ecological patterns or explored what determines individual predictability in movement . Below we discuss the ecological importance of predictability , Fig . 5 Results of the Cox proportional regression model showing the hazard ratios for tagged barn owls in our system . A hazard ratio < 1 indicates increasing survival probability with the increasing rIIV value ( i . e . , less predictable individuals surviving longer ) . A hazard ratio > 1 indicates an increase in hazard and a lower survival probability . For instance , juvenile owls compared to the reference group of adults show a trend in this direction Page 11 of 17 Cain et al . Movement Ecology ( 2023 ) 11 : 10 compare our findings to similar systems and point out some possible future directions . Spatial behavioral types ( BTs ) and movement predictability Consistent among - individual behavioral variation ( aka personality or BTs ) has become mainstream in behav - ioral ecology [ 73 ] . More recently , approaches developed in behavioral ecology have been adopted to study indi - viduality in movement and spatial - BTs [ 10 , 12 ] . Indeed , movement and space use behaviors show relatively high repeatability ( ~ 0 . 67 ; [ 17 ] ) compared to the mean level of other behaviors ( Rp = 0 . 37 ; [ 73 ] ) . These higher values reflect the fact that individuals are repeatedly “assayed” in different environments . The observed differences among them reflect , at least to some extent , the environmental heterogeneity among their HRs [ 74 , 75 ] . Our repeat - ability estimates for the barn owl movements fall on the lower side of this range ( R < 0 . 4 ) . This lower value might reflect a considerable HR overlap among many of our individuals , tracked within a relatively small area . Thus , owls might be experiencing relatively similar conditions that reduce the contribution of spatial heterogeneity to apparent repeatability of their movement . The poor pre - dictive power of the ecological predictors we considered Fig . 6 Factors affecting among - individual differences in rIIV . Panels on the left show a positive correlation between the mean and the intra - individual variation ( rIIV ) of max - displacement split by age ( upper left ) and sex ( lower left ) . Individuals that move more are less predictable with higher rIIV . Panels on the right show a simple box plot for age ( upper right ) and sex ( lower right ) . The asterisk reflects results from a Two - way ANOVA indicating that age but not sex affect rIIV Table 2 Model - averaged coefficients ( full ) for fixed effect in the models predicting predictability ( rIIV ) of barn owls Reference categories for categorical variables were Adult ( age group ) , 2020 ( year ) , Female ( sex ) and Period 1 ( tracking periods ) Estimate SE Adj SE Z value Pr ( > | z | ) ( Intercept ) 1 . 047 0 . 214 0 . 215 4 . 868 1 . 1e − 06 * * * Age—juvenile 0 . 856 0 . 166 0 . 168 5 . 101 3 . 0e − 07 * * * Elevation 0 . 134 0 . 141 0 . 141 0 . 949 0 . 343 Year - 2021 0 . 221 0 . 21 0 . 21 1 . 050 0 . 294 Page 12 of 17 Cain et al . Movement Ecology ( 2023 ) 11 : 10 for HR and movement ( distance from the system’s center , the coordinates , elevation and owls’ density ) supports this explanation . Studies investigating predictability in movement are particularly rare , even though movement data is very suitable for such investigation by offering numerous repeated “assays” ( e . g . , days ) for each tracked individ - ual [ 38 , 39 ] . Here we have used merely two indices of movement ( max displacement and total distances ) , but numerous other indices can be relevant . For instance , Michelangeli et al . [ 23 ] have used several indices ( includ - ing these two ) in order to demonstrate that sleepy lizards ( Tiliqua rugosa ) have distinct spatial - BTs , and that some indices co - vary ( i . e . , movement syndromes ) . Because some of these commonly used movement indices ( e . g . , total tracking distance ) are sensitive to sampling rate [ 76 ] , it is essential to unify rates across individuals ( or to subsample some for unifying it ) . Future studies may sub - sample larger datasets like the one included here to directly test the sensitivity of predictability estimates of different movement indices , or of their combined scores ( e . g . , via principal component analysis ) , to the properties of tracking datasets ( e . g . , resolution , duration , number of individuals ) . Broadly speaking , quantifying predictability from movement tracks should be more accurate when using high resolution data , simply because it improves the esti - mation of the track properties . Our data is of exception - ally high temporal resolution ( a fix every ~ 8 s ) , but we suggest that slightly lower resolutions ( e . g . , fixes every few minutes ) should still be suitable for quantifying pre - dictability as they are quite reliably daily movement pat - terns . Further , predictability estimates for other temporal scales ( e . g . , weekly , seasonally , yearly ) might be highly relevant for other systems , depending on the duration and resolution of the tracking data at hand . Even coarse resolution data might still be suitable for space - use pat - terns ( e . g . , seasonal HR ; [ 18 ] ) but probably less for pre - cise descriptions of the daily movements as done here or for brown bears ( Ursus arctos ) [ 39 ] . Given that high - res - olution datasets with tracking of numerous individuals over longer periods are becoming more readily available thanks to improving technologies [ 25 , 48 ] , we suggest that quantifying spatial - BTs and specifically movement predictability will be very feasible for many more study systems . These detailed tracking datasets , along with complementary sensor data ( e . g . , accelerometers ) will allow more scholars to address individuality of move - ment , and investigate the factors that shape it , and its consequences for individuals and species across space and time [ 24 ] . The ecological importance of movement predictability An association with home‑range size The ecological or evolutionary consequences of BTs are well acknowledged for various systems and contexts [ 77 , 78 ] . Less is known about the implications of spatial - BTs , and the association of their fine - scale movements ( e . g . , daily indices ) with broader space use patterns at the HR scale . Accumulating examples demonstrate that vari - ation in HR size is repeatable , and that it can be linked to independently measured BTs ( e . g . , [ 18 , 79 , 80 ] ) , or to spatial - BTs assess from the movement data itself [ 19 , 23 ] . Arguably , local and global scales are expected to co - vary in indices like the ones used here ( namely max - displace - ment ) , with individuals that move more at the daily scale also covering larger HRs . Indeed , we also find this posi - tive effect of max displacement on HR size ( Fig . 4A ) . We did not find an effect of sex on HR size . Interest - ingly , previous studies of barn owls’ HR reported contra - dicting results . Séchaud et al . [ 81 ] found smaller male HR sizes during the breeding season ( but tracked individu - als for up to two weeks only ) , while Roulin [ 41 ] report a larger HR for males for the same season . Our null result might reflect either a true difference in the biology between the systems ; or the longer scope of our track - ing ( > 25 days per period ) where seasonal changes across the annual cycle mask the differences during breeding season ; or due to differences in home - range estimators used for calculation [ 82 ] . Finally , geographical and other demographic factors had hardly any effect on HR size . Importantly , even while accounting for other con - founding factors ( including max displacement ) , we discover that predictability per se was a strong predic - tor of HR size , with an effect size of almost a half of the max - displacement ( Fig . 4B ) . We find that unpredictable individuals ( high rIIV ) have larger HRs ( even within a cohort and sex group ) . This finding might reflect more consistent and repeatable use of the same locations and is in agreement with previously described syndromes in movement patterns [ 17 , 22 , 23 ] . Future studies may explore if predictable individuals ( in our single index of max displacement ) tended to also do their longer movement in the same locations , and directions further contributing to smaller HRs of these individuals . Unpre - dictable individuals , in contrast , might also show lower predictability in where , when and in what direction they do their long movement , revealing further structures in barn owl movements . More generally , if the strong association between indi - vidual predictability and its HR is generalizable beyond our focal population ( regardless of the specific mecha - nism proposed here ) , this could provide an insightful cur - rency that does not require additional data collection , but merely to include this aspect in relevant models of the Page 13 of 17 Cain et al . Movement Ecology ( 2023 ) 11 : 10 existing tracking data . Given the high relevance of accu - rate HR estimates for diverse questions in ecology and conservations [ 58 , 83 ] , adding this predictive power can facilitate ecological application and improve the predic - tion accuracy of future models . For instance , HR overlap among neighbors is often important for disease and para - site transmission [ 84 , 85 ] . Future studies can also further explore possible effects of population density ( that had no effect in this system ) and HR overlap on behavioral movement indices of individuals and their predictability . Consequences for survival Studying behavioral predictability in the wild might reveal life history trade - offs which are not present in laboratory studies [ 86 ] . Only a handful of studies quan - tified IIV in situ permitting investigation of the ecologi - cal significance of predictability . Examples include IIV in aggressiveness of male deer affecting their mating suc - cess [ 35 ] ; predictability affecting foraging site fidelity of kittiwakes [ 87 ] , and brown bear movement predictability potentially affecting their ability to cope with changes in the environment [ 39 ] . Such studies demonstrate various potential ecological implications of IIV , but to the best of our knowledge , none of the previous examples have dem - onstrated that predictability affected survival , which is arguably the cornerstone of individual fitness . Our long tracking and large sample size allowed us to identify the fate of many individuals , with considerable mortality rates during the study . We find that predictable individuals survive less . This might appear counterintui - tive since predictability can be preserved as a risk - averse behavior . Yet , this interpretation for our context ( sim - ply higher rIIV in max displacement ) is not accurate . Unpredictable movement can in fact reflect the adap - tive response to changing environmental conditions that were unmeasured ( hence adaptive plasticity ) . It can also reflect exploration bouts with long flights ( as evident also in Additional file 1 : Fig . S2 ) providing information and access to spatially different resources [ 88 ] . Further , although individuals expressing more “risky” behaviors should in - theory suffer from higher mortality , bolder BTs were sometimes found to live significantly longer in the wild ( in contrast to the laboratory ) , suggesting that apparently risky behavior in one context can be beneficial in others [ 86 ] . Such findings agree with our result that unpredictable barn owls have a higher survival rate . Factors affecting predictability Identifying what determines individual’s BT , and here specifically its predictability in movement is essential for a mechanistic understating of this phenomenon and its ecological consequences as well as for generalizing across systems . Variation in predictability can reflect both proximate and ultimate reasons . At the proximate level , we find that older individuals are more predictable than young ones . This was demonstrated before for the predictability of other behaviors [ 33 , 38 , 43 ] . Common explanations for such ‘canalization’ include the idea that with increased exposure to predictable cues , individuals may become more certain in their assessment of the envi - ronment allowing traits to become fixated . Other sug - gested explanations have to do with traits being linked to physiological factors such as growth rate and hormonal profiles , and behaviors change concurrently with these physiological reorganizations . Observed consistent behavioral differences among individuals recorded under natural conditions may not reflect only inherent differences in spatial - BTs , but also arise from ( at least partially ) differences in the geographi - cal features or resource distribution [ 17 , 75 ] . Here we do not find support for this general pattern in explain - ing variation in predictability . In our study system , there is an elevation gradient ( from + 100 m ASL at the west , down to − 250 m BSL in the east ) , affecting local temper - ature , soil type and crop type , which in turn determine food availability ( abundance and species composition of the rodent community ) . Yet , variation in predictability was not associated with the gradient ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S2 ) or other geographical factors , and more / less pre - dictable individuals were apparently randomly distrib - uted along the region , supporting the argument that our measured behavior results ( mostly ) from a genuine inher - ent behavioral tendencies and preferences of individuals . In the future , experimental approaches ( e . g . , relocation ) can reveal the distinct contributions of background het - erogeneity and the individual tendency to spatial - BTs [ 75 ] . On a more ultimate level , differences in spatial - BTs can arise from several reasons including individual diet specialization—variations in preferences for certain habi - tat features , resources ( a particular type of food ) , and / or social interactions [ 89 ] . While some of these are likely consistent at the individual level [ 90 ] others will depend on the environmental dynamics . In the future , studies can explore if differences in predictability are associated with diet preferences , and what mechanisms generate apparent differences in predictability that remain repeat - able over time . One may ask whether the shape of the dis - tribution of the index in mind ( here max displacement ) changes . Namely , this asks if unpredictable individuals just have larger variation , or do they have a fat - tailed distribution . Indeed , here we find support for the latter , with high rIIV values appearing through very long - range displacement in a small subset of nights ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S3 ) , and not through a homogenous larger variation . Whether these long - range movements reflect a Page 14 of 17 Cain et al . Movement Ecology ( 2023 ) 11 : 10 distinct behavioral mode expressed only in certain indi - viduals ( and why ) remains unknown . Such modes can be inferred from modeling step size and turning angle dis - tributions , allowing identification of different subgroups in the population [ 91 , 92 ] . Applying such an approach to spatial - BTs of different predictabilities may offer a strong integration of existing tools from movement ecology with new concepts from behavioral ecology . Concluding remarks In this initial study we only explored spatial - BTs in three traits ( travel distance , max - displacement , and predict - ability of the latter ) . Yet , future studies of spatial - BTs and spatial syndromes can expand to various other movement indices . These may include classical indices of movement ( e . g . , tortuosity ; [ 22 , 23 ] ) and space use [ 17 , 93 ] , as well as newer indices such as movement openness and diam - eter [ 36 ] . Similarly , other factors affecting rIIV beyond those explored here ( sex , age , year , season and a few local environmental indicators ) can be investigated . As well as other ecological and evolutionary consequences ( beyond HR size and survival addressed here ) can be studied . Future topics may include the implications of spatial - BT for parasite prevalence [ 94 ] , or breeding success [ 35 ] . Finally , our tracking is biased toward owls staying within the ATLAS region . In our study , 20 out of the 45 juveniles left the study area ( for at least 24 h ) , yet most of them returned after some absence . If individuals with remarkably different spatial - BTs choose to leave the region completely [ 95 ] then our sample might be under - estimating the variation in the population . Despite these limitations , we were able to describe the prevalence of spatial - BTs and consistent variation in individual pre - dictability within our population . We also validated the ecological relevance of predictability to their fitness ( via survival ) and broader space use ( HR size ) . Unpredictable individuals may cope better under changing environ - mental conditions [ 39 ] . Human - induced environmen - tal changes act as a non - random filter selecting species capable of coping with such changes . Likewise , environ - mental changes can also affect intraspecific composition , with predictability in movement indices as key axes that is still poorly explored [ 28 , 32 ] . Understanding the scope and role of intraspecific variation in movement and other spatial behaviors will help us better conserve species , their habitats , and their ecological roles ( e . g . , [ 10 , 96 ] ) in the face of unprecedented environmental change .
