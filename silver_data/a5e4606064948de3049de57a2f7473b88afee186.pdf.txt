Recent studies have suggested that changes in the biophysical 33 properties of the cytoplasm play a key role in cellular homeostasis and adaptation . However , it still 34 remains unclear how cells control their cytoplasmic properties in response to environmental cues . Here , 35 we used fission yeast spores as a model system of dormant cells to elucidate the mechanisms 36 underlying regulation of the cytoplasmic properties . By tracking fluorescent tracer particles , we found 37 that particle mobility decreased in spores compared to vegetative cells , and rapidly increased at the 38 onset of dormancy breaking upon glucose addition . This cytoplasmic fluidization depended on glucose 39 sensing via the cAMP - PKA pathway . PKA activation led to trehalose degradation through trehalase 40 Ntp1 , thereby increasing particle mobility as the amount of trehalose decreased . In contrast , the rapid 41 cytoplasmic fluidization did not require de novo protein synthesis , cytoskeletal dynamics , or cell 42 volume increase . Furthermore , the measurement of diffusion coefficients with tracer particles of 43 different sizes suggests that the spore cytoplasm impedes the movement of larger protein complexes 44 ( 40 – 150 nm ) such as ribosomes , while allowing free diffusion of smaller molecules ( ~ 3 nm ) such as 45 second messengers and signaling proteins . Our experiments have thus uncovered a series of signaling 46 events that enable cells to quickly fluidize the cytoplasm at the onset of dormancy breaking . 47 48 Significance statement 49 Cellular processes are influenced by the biophysical properties of the cytoplasm such as crowding and 50 viscoelasticity . Although it has been suggested that cells tune the cytoplasmic properties in response to 51 environmental changes , the molecular mechanisms remain unclear . Here , we used the dormant fission 52 yeast spores and uncovered signaling pathways that facilitate cytoplasmic fluidization during dormancy 53 breaking . Furthermore , we tracked the mobility of intracellular tracer particles , and found that the spore 54 cytoplasm impedes the mobility of larger protein complexes , while allowing free diffusion of smaller 55 molecules . These results suggest that small signaling proteins can diffuse relatively freely in the spore 56 cytoplasm and have the ability to transmit dormancy breaking signals , while the motion of large 57 complexes , such as ribosomes , is restricted . 58 59 60 61 62 Introduction 63 64 The cytoplasm is a crowded environment that is densely packed with macromolecules ( e . g . , proteins , 65 nucleic acids , lipids ) and organelles . The crowded environments decrease the mobility of molecules , 66 and inhibit diffusion - limited reactions by reducing the encounter rates of molecules ; on the other hand , 67 the crowded conditions can also promote intermolecular assembly through entropic effects , and 68 facilitate reaction - limited reactions . Furthermore , accumulating evidence has shown that the cytoplasm 69 is not a simple crowded milieu , but rather displays a complex porous structure ( 1 – 3 ) , which is not 70 reproduced by in vitro assays such as BSA solution ( 4 , 5 ) . In addition , there is rapidly - growing interest 71 in the physiological significance of cytoplasmic viscoelasticity and pH ( 6 , 7 ) . The cytoplasmic 72 structures and physico - chemistry influence many different biochemical reactions and cellular 73 organization ( 8 , 9 ) , including microtubule dynamics ( 10 ) , protein production ( 11 ) , phase separation 74 ( 12 ) , and kinase reactions ( 13 – 15 ) . 75 76 The biophysical properties , such as the structures and physico - chemistry , of the cytoplasm are 77 disturbed by environmental changes . For example , hyper - osmotic stress enhances molecular crowding 78 through dehydration , which inhibits macromolecular movement ( 10 , 12 , 16 , 17 ) . Energy depletion and 79 nutrient starvation also cause reduced motion of macromolecules in the cytoplasm ( 7 , 18 – 21 ) . 80 However , to adapt to environmental changes , cells maintain homeostasis by autonomously regulating 81 the biophysical properties of the cytoplasm . A recent study has shown that mammalian cells possess a 82 molecular crowding sensor , with - no - lysine kinase 1 ( WNK1 ) , which leads to cell volume recovery and 83 reduced crowding in response to hyperosmotic stress ( 22 ) . As another example , upon temperature 84 increase , budding yeast cells synthesize trehalose and glycogen to increase cytoplasmic viscosity , 85 which counteracts the increase in protein diffusivity ( 23 ) . 86 87 Dormancy is a cellular state , in which the metabolic activity is decreased and the cell cycle is 88 reversibly arrested under unfavorable conditions ( 7 , 24 ) . Those characteristics link to the cytoplasmic 89 properties of dormant cells with reduced fluidity and molecular mobility . For example , it is known that 90 the cytoplasms of dormant cells show a solid or glass - like properties due to their reduced water content ; 91 such characteristic cytoplasms are observed in diverse species such as bacterial spores ( 25 , 26 ) , fungal 92 spores ( 27 ) , plant seeds ( 28 ) , tardigrades ( 29 ) , and sleeping chironomids ( 30 ) . Recently , micro - 93 rheological measurements revealed that macromolecular mobility is restricted inside the cytoplasm of 94 dormant cells ( 7 , 19 , 24 ) . However , it remains unclear what molecular mechanisms are involved in the 95 reversible change in cytoplasmic fluidity , and which and how intracellular signaling pathways govern 96 these processes . In particular , since the cytoplasmic properties in a dormant state suppress intracellular 97 diffusion and reaction , it is puzzling how dormant cells can still achieve a rapid resumption of cell 98 growth when environmental conditions improve . 99 100 Here , we demonstrate that the glucose - sensing pathway triggers cytoplasmic fluidization during 101 dormancy breaking of spores in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe . The fission yeast enters 102 a dormant state by forming spores under nutrient starvation , and glucose refeeding breaks the 103 dormancy , which is called germination . By using micro - rheological tracer particles , we show that the 104 cytoplasmic fluidity of spores is limited compared to that of vegetative cells . The solidified cytoplasm 105 in spores rapidly fluidizes upon glucose stimulation . This fluidization process is dependent on the 106 degradation of trehalose , which is regulated by the cAMP - PKA pathway . Based on our findings using 107 tracer particles of different sizes , we propose the existence of a dormancy - specific intracellular milieu , 108 which impedes diffusion of large protein complexes such as ribosomes , while allowing relatively free 109 diffusion of small signaling proteins . 110 111 Results 112 113 Fission yeast spores restrict the movement of particles with a diameter of 40 nm . 114 In this study , we adopted the fission yeast S . pombe spore as a model system for studying the molecular 115 mechanisms underlying the change in cytoplasmic fluidity during dormancy breaking . To evaluate the 116 biophysical properties in the cytoplasm of the fission yeast spore , we first compared the motion of 117 foreign tracer particles between vegetative cells and spores . Due to the rigid cell wall , it is technically 118 challenging to inject tracer particles into fission yeast cells ( 31 ) . To overcome this limitation , we used 119 genetically encoded multimeric nanoparticles ( GEMs ) , which self - assemble into a spherical particle 120 with a diameter of 40 nm ( hereafter referred to as 40 - nm GEMs ) ( Fig . 1A ) ( 12 ) . The gene encoding 40 - 121 nm GEMs fused to a fluorescent protein , T - Sapphire , was introduced into the fission yeast , resulting in 122 the formation of bright tracer particles in both vegetative cells and spores ( Fig . 1B , Movie S1 ) . The 123 GEM particles were tracked to obtain trajectories and estimate the effective diffusion coefficient ( D eff ) 124 from the mean - squared displacement ( MSD ) curves ( see Materials and Methods ) . The median effective 125 diffusion coefficient was 0 . 54 μm 2 / s in vegetative cells ( Fig . 1C and D ) , which was comparable to the 126 diffusion coefficient values in the previous studies using 40 - nm GEMs in fission yeast vegetative cells 127 ( 10 , 32 – 34 ) . As we expected , the median effective diffusion coefficient of 0 . 025 μm 2 / s in spores 128 indicates that the GEMs in spores were approximately 20 times less mobile compared with those in 129 vegetative cells ( Fig . 1C and D ) . In addition , using the ensemble - averaged MSD curves of vegetative 130 cells and spores ( inset , Fig . 1C ) , we computed the anomalous exponent to be ~ 0 . 9 in vegetative cells 131 and ~ 0 . 75 in spores . This means that the spore cytoplasm made the GEM motion strongly subdiffusive ; 132 in other words , the GEM motion in spores was hindered by , for example , the enhanced macromolecular 133 crowding and / or higher cytoplasmic viscoelasticity . After the spores were purified and stored at 4°C , 134 GEM mobility was measured over time . GEM mobility decreased slightly as the spores were stored at 135 4°C ( Fig . S1A and B ) , indicating that the GEM mobility does not substantially change during the 136 storage of spores at 4°C . These results show , for the first time , that the cytoplasmic fluidity in fission 137 yeast spores is strongly restricted compared to that in vegetative cells . 138 139 Fig 1 .

The results of three independent experiments are 158 plotted with different colored dots ( n > 300 for each condition ) . The inset indicates the representative 159 anomalous exponent α during germination . 160 161 The mobility of 40 nm particles increases during the initial stage of spore germination . 162 Next , we examined when the reduced 40 - nm GEMs mobility in spores recovered during dormancy 163 breaking . For induction of germination , spores were transferred to glucose - rich medium . Consistent 164 with previous reports ( 35 – 39 ) , phase contrast microscopy indicated that the spore cytoplasm underwent 165 a bright - to - dark transition approximately 1 hr after induction , followed by spore swelling and germ 166 tube elongation after 4 – 6 hr ( Fig . 1E ) . We tracked the GEM particles and found that the effective 167 diffusion coefficient rapidly increased by 7 - fold within the first hour after induction and subsequently 168 reached the same level as that in vegetative cells ( Fig . 1F and G , Movie S2 ) . The subdiffusive 169 anomalous exponent also showed the rapid recovery ( inset , Fig . 1G and Fig . S2 ) . Interestingly , the 170 GEM mobility began to increase before the bright - to - dark transition under phase contrast microscopy , 171 which is traditionally the earliest hallmark of germination onset ( 35 ) and signaling dynamics ( 37 , 40 ) . 172 173 Glucose - sensing via the cAMP - PKA pathway is essential for the increase in the mobility of 40 nm 174 particles during germination . 175 To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the observed increase in 40 - nm GEMs mobility in 176 the early phase of germination ( Fig . 1F and G ) , we first focused on glucose - sensing via the cyclic 177 adenosine monophosphate - protein kinase A ( cAMP - PKA ) pathway ( Fig . 2A ) ( 41 – 43 ) . Glucose is 178 recognized by a G - protein coupled receptor , Git3 , at the plasma membrane , thereby activating the 179 adenylate cyclase , Cyr1 ( Fig . 2A ) . The activated Cyr1 produces cAMP , which binds to the PKA 180 regulatory subunit , Cgs1 , and finally activates the PKA catalytic subunit , Pka1 ( Fig . 2A ) . This pathway 181 is known to play a critical role in the initiation of germination in fission yeast spores ( 35 ) . Indeed , in 182 the strains pka1 Δ and cyr1 Δ , these spores did not exhibit any bright - to - dark transition ( Fig . 2B ) or 183 germ tube elongation ( Fig . 2C ) even 15 hr after the addition of glucose . We therefore examined 184 whether the cAMP - PKA pathway is required for the increase in the GEM mobility , which precedes the 185 canonical early event of germination such as bright - to - dark transition and germ tube elongation . We 186 found that the GEM mobility remained unchanged in mutant strains lacking cAMP - PKA pathway 187 components ( pka1 , cyr1 , or git3 ) up to 6 hr after germination induction ( Fig . 2D ) . This result indicates 188 that the activation of the cAMP - PKA pathway in response to glucose is necessary for the increase in 189 the GEM mobility during germination . 190 191 Fig 2 .

Scale bar , 5 μm . 196 ( C ) Percentage of germinated spores showing an elongated germ tube at 15 hr ( 900 min ) after the 197 glucose addition ( WT , n = 147 cells ; pka1 Δ , n = 356 cells ; cyr1 Δ , n = 163 cells ) . 198 ( D ) Median D eff of 40 - nm GEMs during germination in the wild - type ( WT ) , pka1 Δ , cyr1 Δ , and git3 Δ 199 strains ( n > 250 for each condition ) . 200 201 Germination - induced changes in particle assembly , cellular volume , protein synthesis , and 202 cytoskeletal dynamics have no impact on the increase in mobility of 40 nm particles . 203 In addition to the cAMP - PKA pathway , we explored other possible mechanisms affecting the mobility 204 of 40 - nm GEMs during germination . We first examined the change in particle assembly during the 205 germination . The fluorescence intensity of each single particle appeared to decrease in spores as the 206 germination proceeded ( Fig . 1E ) , which might reflect the change in multimerization and / or size of the 207 GEM particles . To examine the effects on the increase in the 40 - nm GEM mobility , we quantified the 208 fluorescence intensity of a single GEM particle at different time points ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 hr ) from 209 germination in spores and in vegetative cells ( Fig . 3A ) . The distributions of fluorescence intensity of 210 40 - nm GEMs in germinating spores and vegetative cells showed unimodal distribution , and their peaks 211 shifted leftward as the germination proceeded ( Fig . 3A ) . Although 6 hr after germination induction the 212 average fluorescence intensity of particles was 1 . 5 - fold less than before induction , the fluorescence 213 intensity did not change within the first 2 hr of germination induction ( Fig . 3A and B ) . Importantly , the 214 40 - nm GEM mobility increased significantly within an hour of germination induction ( Fig . 1F and G ) . 215 From these results , we concluded that the rapid increase in the 40 - nm GEM mobility was not 216 attributable to the change in particle assembly and / or size during germination . 217 Prior works have shown that a reduction in cellular volume decreases macromolecular mobility 218 under hyper - osmotic stress and nutrient starvation ( 10 , 16 , 18 ) . Indeed , the cellular volume increases as 219 the germination proceeds ( Fig . 1E ) ( 35 , 37 ) . We therefore asked whether the increase in cellular 220 volume contributed to the increase in the 40 - nm GEM mobility after germination induction . For 221 simplicity , we quantified cytoplasmic areas by using spores expressing mNeonGreen ( Fig . 3C ) . The 222 cytoplasmic area of spores did not change within 2 hr after germination induction , but increased 223 thereafter ( Fig . 3D ) . Thus , these results strongly suggest that the increase in cytoplasmic volume during 224 germination does not cause the increase in the 40 - nm GEM mobility in the early stage of germination . 225 Finally , we explored the effects of protein synthesis or cytoskeleton on the 40 - nm GEM 226 mobility by using small chemical inhibitors . Treatment with a translation inhibitor , cycloheximide 227 ( CHX ) , or a TOR inhibitor , Torin1 , did not change the effective diffusion coefficients of 40 - nm GEMs 228 during germination ( Fig . 3E – G ) . Meanwhile , both CHX and Torin1 blocked the swelling and germ 229 tube formation caused by germination induction ( Fig . 3E ) , indicating that protein synthesis is necessary 230 for the processes of swelling and germ tube formation , but not for the increase in the 40 - nm GEM 231 mobility in the earlier stage of germination . We next asked whether the cytoskeletal structure and / or 232 dynamics influence the 40 - nm GEM mobility . Intracellular particle diffusion is known to be affected 233 by cytoskeletons and molecular motors ( 12 , 44 ) . To examine these effects , we treated cells with an 234 actin depolymerizer , latrunculin A ( LatA ) , and / or microtubule - destabilizing agents , thiabendazole 235 ( TBZ ) and carbendazim ( CBZ ) , but none of these compounds had any impact on the 40 - nm GEM 236 mobility ( Fig . 3H ) . The germ tube formation was inhibited by treatment with these drugs ( Fig . 3E ) . 237 These results demonstrate that the cytoskeletal changes make a negligible contribution to the increase 238 in the 40 - nm GEM mobility during germination . 239 240 Fig 3 .

( E ) 252 Representative DIC images of germinating spores at 0 hr and 6 hr after glucose addition in the absence 253 or presence of cycloheximide ( CHX ) , Torin1 , latrunculin A ( LatA ) , thiabendazole ( TBZ ) , carbendazim 254 ( CBZ ) , and 2 - deoxyglucose ( 2 - DG ) . Scale bar , 10 μm . ( F – I ) Median D eff of 40 - nm GEMs during 255 germination in the presence of CHX ( F ) , Torin1 ( G ) , LatA , TBZ , CBZ ( H ) , and 2 - DG ( I ) ( n > 170 for 256 each condition ) . 257 258 ATP production via glycolysis contributes to an increase in 40 nm particle mobility after 1 hr of 259 germination . 260 Previous studies have shown that ATP depletion drastically reduces tracer particle diffusion in bacterial 261 cells ( 7 , 19 , 44 ) , yeast cells ( 7 , 45 ) , and mammalian cells ( 44 ) . We therefore investigated whether de 262 novo ATP synthesis affords the 40 - nm GEM mobility in the germination process . Previous studies 263 reported that a glycolysis inhibitor decreased the ATP level in vegetative cells of S . pombe ( 46 , 47 ) . In 264 light of these reports , we treated spores with an inhibitor of glycolysis , 2 - deoxyglucose ( 2 - DG ) , which 265 resulted in the inhibition of swelling and germ tube formation at 6 hr after germination induction ( Fig . 266 3E ) . This result indicates that ATP synthesis via glycolysis is required for the germination progression . 267 Interestingly , the 40 - nm GEM mobility increased within an hour after germination induction even in 268 the presence of 2 - DG , but remained at a constant level thereafter ( Fig . 3I ) . From these results , we found 269 that the 40 - nm GEM mobility was independent of ATP synthesis via the glycolysis immediately after 270 germination initiation but was dependent on it from 1 hr after germination initiation . However , the 271 effect of glycolysis on 40 - nm GEM mobility after 1 hr of germination initiation was relatively small , 272 increasing the effective diffusion coefficient by only 2 - to 3 - fold . 273 274 Trehalose degradation downstream of the cAMP - PKA pathway increases 40 nm particle mobility 275 during germination . 276 Among the possible mechanisms for increased 40 nm GEM mobility during germination , we focused 277 on intracellular trehalose , a disaccharide formed by a 1 , 1 - glycosidic bond between two glucose 278 molecules . As previously demonstrated ( 48 , 49 ) , trehalose in spores accumulated nearly 1 , 000 - fold 279 compared to the level in vegetative cells ( Fig . 4A ) . We roughly estimated that the trehalose 280 concentration was approximately 5 % w / v in a fission yeast spore ( see Materials and Methods ) . 281 Furthermore , recent studies have shown that vegetative cells of budding yeast respond to heat shock by 282 accumulating trehalose , which increases cytoplasmic viscosity and thus maintains a constant protein 283 diffusion rate ( 23 ) . Therefore , we hypothesized that trehalose accumulation causes a decrease in 284 cytoplasmic viscosity in spores and that trehalose degradation triggers the cytoplasmic fluidization 285 upon germination . 286 To investigate this hypothesis , we first quantified how the trehalose amount in fission yeast 287 spores changed during germination , and found that trehalose was rapidly degraded on the same 288 timescale as the increase in the 40 - nm GEM mobility ( Fig . 4B ) . We then measured the trehalose 289 amount and the GEM mobility in a mutant strain lacking ntp1 , a trehalase gene ( 50 ) . We found that 290 ntp1 - deleted cells ( ntp1 Δ ) did not show the rapid decrease in trehalose amount within 1 hr of 291 germination induction observed in WT cells , and their trehalose amount remained constant up to 8 hr 292 after germination induction ( Fig . 4C ) . Additionally , in spores lacking pka1 , trehalose degradation was 293 suppressed after germination induction ( Fig . 4C ) , implying that the cAMP - PKA pathway controls the 294 trehalose degradation pathway . We also found that the germination process was severely delayed in the 295 ntp1 Δ strain , which is incapable of forming a germ tube 8 hr after germination ( Fig . 4D ) , consistent 296 with a previous report ( 49 ) . Importantly , the increase in 40 - nm GEM mobility was substantially 297 suppressed in the ntp1 Δ strain compared to the WT after germination induction ( Fig . 4E ) . These results 298 suggest that Ntp1 - mediated trehalose degradation is required for the cytoplasmic fluidization and rapid 299 germination through the cAMP - PKA pathway . 300 We recognized that a small fraction of spores in the ntp1 Δ strain displayed swelling , an initial 301 feature of germination , 8 hr after germination induction ( Fig . 4D , red arrows ) . This result could be due 302 to the Ntp1 - independent trehalose degradation in this small population of spores , resulting in the 303 progression of germination . Indeed , the quantification of the effective diffusion coefficients of GEMs 304 at the single spore level revealed that approximately one - third of ntp1 Δ spores showed an increase in 305 the 40 - nm GEM mobility comparable to wild - type spores 6 hr after germination induction ( Fig . 4F ) . 306 Consistent with these results , the trehalose amount decreased even in ntp1 Δ spores 24 hr after the 307 germination induction , while it remained unchanged in pka1 Δ spores ( Fig . 4G ) . Taken together , these 308 results lead us to propose the existence of at least two trehalose degradation pathways during the spore 309 germination of fission yeast ; one is Ntp1 - dependent fast trehalose degradation , whereas the other is 310 Ntp1 - independent slow trehalose degradation ( Fig . 4H ) . Both trehalose degradation pathways are 311 controlled by the cAMP - PKA pathway ( Fig . 4H ) . We note that the former pathway , Ntp1 - dependent 312 fast trehalose degradation , is necessary for rapid germination in response to glucose stimulation . 313 314 315 Fig 4 .

First , we developed a spore - specific gene expression system in fission yeast cells 353 by using promoters whose expression was specifically induced after the completion of the sporulation 354 process . By reanalyzing previously reported microarray data during sporulation in fission yeast cells 355 ( 51 ) , we identified the top 4 genes ( SPAC869 . 09 , hry1 , isp3 , pdc202 ) whose expression was strongly 356 induced in spores compared to vegetative cells . The region approximately 1 , 000 bp upstream of those 357 genes was used as the promoter region to express a certain gene in spores . We named these promoters 358 Posi1 - 4 ( Promoters for only spore induction ) , respectively . We quantified the expression levels of 359 mNeonGreen under Posi1 - 4 ( Fig . S3A – D ) , and found that Posi2 showed the highest ratio of the 360 expression of mNeonGreen in spores to that in vegetative cells ( Fig . S3E ) . Therefore , we used Posi2 361 for the following experiment . 362 To investigate whether Ntp1 overexpression suffices to induce germination , we established and 363 analyzed spores overexpressing Ntp1 under Posi2 . However , the spores overexpressing Ntp1 did not 364 show any morphological change in the absence of glucose and exhibited an accelerated increase in the 365 40 - nm GEM mobility upon glucose stimulation . Therefore , we next overexpressed Ntp1 in spores 366 deficient in the cAMP - PKA pathway and treated the spores with glucose in order to examine the effects 367 of Ntp1 overexpression on glucose - induced morphological change and the 40 - nm GEM mobility . 368 Spores lacking gpa2 , the gene encoding heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunit ( Fig . 2A ) , which 369 mediates the glucose receptor and the cAMP - PKA pathway , demonstrated a significant delay in 370 swelling upon glucose stimulation ( Fig . 4I ) , as seen in pka1 - or cyr1 - deleted spores ( Fig . 2B and C ) . 371 Meanwhile , the overexpression of Ntp1 in spores lacking gpa2 partially rescued the glucose - induced 372 germination , namely swelling ( Fig . 4I ) . The 40 - nm GEM mobility was also partially increased by the 373 overexpression of Ntp1 at the population level ( Fig . 4J ) and at the single cell level ( Fig . 4K ) . These 374 results suggest that both Ntp1 and nutrient sources such as glucose in the germination induction 375 medium are sufficient for swelling and cytoplasmic fluidization . 376 377 The mobility of 50 – 150 nm particles also decreases in spores and increases at the onset of 378 germination . 379 To gain further insight into the spore cytoplasm , we examined the size dependency of particle 380 diffusion , which reflects the spatial scales of cytoplasmic structures ( 12 , 52 , 53 ) . We first observed the 381 mobility of particles with size larger than 40 - nm GEMs by using μNS , which self - assembles into 382 particles of different sizes ( 50 – 150 nm ) ( 19 , 54 ) . In both vegetative cells and spores , μNS were 383 observed as particles of varying size and brightness ( Fig . 5A ) . We then analyzed the μNS particles with 384 fluorescence intensities lower than a certain threshold to mitigate the effects of size variability ( Fig . 385 S4A ) . The effective diffusion coefficients were 0 . 015 μm² / s and 0 . 00033 μm² / s in vegetative cells and 386 spores , respectively , indicating that the mobility of μNS , similarly to that of 40 - nm GEMs , was 387 strongly restricted in spores ( Fig . 5B ) . During the germination process , the μNS mobility was gradually 388 increased ( Fig . 5C ) , which is consistent with a previous report on budding yeast spores ( 24 ) . Within the 389 first 2 hr of germination , μNS mobility increased about 6 - fold , followed by a gradual increase in μNS 390 mobility . We also quantified the anomalous exponent during germination from the ensemble - averaged 391 MSD curves ( inset , Fig . 5C and Fig . S4B ) . Compared with the GEMs , the μNS in spores exhibited a 392 much smaller anomalous exponent value , α < 0 . 2 . This result indicates that , in spores , the μNS particles 393 were almost immobilized in the time scale of observation . To provide further support for this idea , we 394 computed velocity autocorrelation functions ( VAFs ) ( Fig . S4C – H ) , which were used as a diagnostic 395 tool to explore the underlying mechanism of intracellular subdiffusion ( 7 , 55 ) . The VAFs of the spore 396 cytoplasm showed sharper negative peaks compared to those of cells 1 hr after germination induction 397 or vegetative cells ( Fig . S4D , F , and H ) . These results suggest that the μNS particles are locally 398 confined and their motion is caused by their bouncing off elastic structures as they collide with them . 399 400 Fluorescent protein - sized particles diffuse throughout the spore cytoplasm within a time frame 401 on the order of seconds . 402 Although the diffusion of 40 - nm GEMs and μNS was drastically restricted in the spore cytoplasm ( Fig . 403 1C and 5B ) , it remains unclear whether smaller proteins are also affected by the change in the 404 biophysical properties of spores . To investigate this , we quantified the effective diffusion coefficients 405 of the green fluorescent protein mNeonGreen ( mNG , around 3 nm in size ) , which is smaller than 40 - 406 nm GEMs . We first observed the movement of mNG by using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy 407 ( FCS ) . FCS is a technique used to estimate the effective diffusion coefficient in a confocal volume ( ~ 1 408 fL ) by observing the fluctuation of fluorescent molecules ( 56 – 58 ) . In the FCS analysis , we measured 409 the time - series of mNG intensity in vegetative cells and spores of fission yeast and obtained 410 autocorrelation functions ( Fig . S5A and B ) . The effective diffusion coefficient of mNG in spores was 411 about 4 - fold reduced compared to that in vegetative cells ( Fig . 5D and S5C ) . For further examination , 412 we used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) to estimate the effective diffusion 413 coefficient of mNG . Due to the tiny volume of fission yeast cells , especially the spores , a 414 photobleached region inevitably overlaps with the cell boundary ( Fig . S5D ) , which violates geometrical 415 assumptions of the common fitting curve in FRAP analysis . To deal with this issue , we numerically 416 simulated mNG diffusion by following the method of a previous FRAP study on bacterial cells ( 59 ) . 417 Then , we estimated the effective diffusion coefficient by matching the experimental and simulated 418 FRAP time courses . In vegetative cells , the estimated effective diffusion coefficients of mNG based on 419 FCS and FRAP were close to each other ( Fig . 5D and S5E ) . In spores , interestingly , we found that the 420 mNG diffusivity obtained from FRAP was much lower than that from FCS ( Fig . 5D and S5E ) . It is not 421 uncommon for the FRAP analysis to produce estimates of the effective diffusion coefficient of a 422 protein that are an order of magnitude smaller than those of the FCS . Potential mechanisms underlying 423 this discrepancy include inhomogeneous diffusivity and / or binding to immobile intracellular structures 424 ( 60 , 61 ) , although determining the precise mechanism for the spore cytoplasm requires further 425 investigation . In our present experiments , even in the FRAP analysis , mNG diffused throughout the 426 spore cytoplasm within a time frame on the order of seconds ( Fig . S5D ) . Based on these results , it is 427 proposed that small signaling proteins , such as cAMP - PKA pathway and Ntp1 , are relatively free to 428 diffuse in the spore cytoplasm and have the ability to transmit dormancy breaking signals after the 429 glucose addition , while the motion of large protein complexes is restricted . 430 431 432 Fig . 5 The mobility of particles of different sizes in spores and vegetative cells . 433 ( A ) Representative DIC ( upper ) and confocal fluorescence images ( lower ) of fission yeast cells 434 expressing μNS at the indicated time after germination induction .

Vegetative cell / Spore indicates the ratio of the effective diffusion coefficients of vegetative 442 cells to those of spores . 443 444 Discussion 445 446 Growing evidence indicates that a liquid - like cytoplasmic property turns into a solid - or glass - like state 447 under stress conditions , and these cytoplasmic changes have been proposed to be responsible for stress 448 resistance and dormancy breaking ( 7 , 24 ) . However , the molecular basis underlying such changes in 449 the cytoplasmic properties in response to environmental stimuli is not yet fully understood . In this 450 study , we focused on the germination of fission yeast spores as a model system of dormancy breaking . 451 By using genetically encoded tracer particles , we found that the spore cytoplasm markedly hinders 452 intracellular diffusion , and rapidly fluidizes upon germination induction . The cytoplasmic fluidization 453 during germination is mediated by the degradation of intracellular trehalose . Furthermore , we revealed 454 the signaling pathway responsible for the trehalose degradation – – namely , glucose is recognized by 455 Git3 , resulting in activation of the cAMP - PKA pathway and Ntp1 . 456 457 We examined the mobility of three types of particles of different sizes in the spore cytoplasm as 458 summarized in Fig . 6 . First , although the diffusivity of mNG in spores was reduced , mNG can still 459 diffuse throughout the spore cytoplasm within a time frame on the scale of seconds ( Fig . S5D ) . This 460 result indicates that signaling molecules such as PKA and Ntp1 diffuse relatively freely even in the 461 spore cytoplasm and can respond rapidly to external signals for dormancy breaking . The large 462 discrepancy between the FRAP - and FCS - based estimates of mNG diffusivity in spores ( Fig . 5D ) 463 might reflect a spore - specific cytoplasmic state , because the cytoplasm of vegetative cells did not 464 produce such a discrepancy . An interesting possibility is the presence of immobile binding traps , which 465 have been theoretically investigated to reconcile disparate estimates of the diffusion coefficient of 466 Bicoid morphogen in Drosophila embryos ( 60 , 62 ) . Second , we found a marked reduction in the 467 effective diffusion coefficients of 40 - nm GEMs and strong subdiffusion of those particles in spores 468 ( Fig . 1C and G ) . These results mean that the mobility of large complexes such as the ribosome ( ~ 30 469 nm ) is severely limited in spores . Recently , in vitro experiments using E . coli and Xenopus cytoplasms 470 demonstrated that an overcrowded cytoplasm can suppress the ribosome mobility and thereby the 471 translational activity ( 63 , 64 ) . It is likely that the cytoplasmic biophysics of spores also suppresses the 472 translational activity . The decrease in protein synthesis may allow spores to avoid wasting energy 473 sources ( e . g . , ATP ) and substrates ( e . g . , amino acids , nucleic acids ) , thus enabling their prolonged 474 survival without nutrients . Third , the μNS particles exhibited a drastic reduction in an anomalous 475 exponent ( α ~ 0 . 1 ) , which means that they were almost immobilized in the spore cytoplasm ( Fig . 5C ) . 476 Previous studies have reported that large structures such as protein condensates ( ~ 200 – 1000 nm ) and 477 organelles ( ~ 100 – 1000 nm ) are immobilized in energy - depleted and nutrient - starved yeast cells ( 7 , 18 – 478 20 ) . However , the anomalous exponent of μNS ( 50 ~ 150 nm ) in spores ( α ~ 0 . 1 ) is far smaller than that 479 in energy - depleted yeast cells ( α ~ 0 . 6 ) ( 7 ) . This indicates that the spore cytoplasm is an extreme 480 environment , and probing its material properties such as viscoelasticity could pave the way for a deeper 481 understanding of the stress resistance achieved by the spores . 482 483 484 Fig 6 . A model of cytoplasmic properties in vegetative cells and spores of fission yeast . 485 The amount of trehalose plays a key role in regulation of the cytoplasmic properties in fission yeast 486 cells . Vegetative cells contain only a small amount of cytoplasmic trehalose , and mNG ( ~ 3 nm ) , 40 - nm 487 GEMs ( ~ 40 nm ) , and μNS ( ~ 50 – 150 nm ) are free to diffuse in the cytoplasm . On the other hand , in 488 spores , trehalose is highly accumulated , resulting in a decrease in the mobility of these particles . The 489 mobility of 40 - nm GEMs and μNS is strongly limited in the spore cytoplasm , while mNG are allowed 490 to diffuse relatively freely throughout the cytoplasm . 491 492 Trehalose has been well characterized as a protein protectant and a viscosity agent in vitro ( 65 ) . 493 To our knowledge , however , there have been no studies on the molecular mechanism of trehalose in the 494 regulation of cytoplasmic biophysics in vivo except for a few pioneering works ( 23 , 66 , 67 ) . Our study 495 shows that trehalose accumulates in spores at a concentration of 5 % w / v ( Fig . 4A ) , and trehalose is 496 rapidly degraded by germination induction ( Fig . 4B ) , resulting in a 20 - fold increase in 40 - nm GEM 497 mobility . Furthermore , depletion of an enzyme that degrades trehalose , Ntp1 , was shown to inhibit the 498 increase in the 40 - nm GEM mobility upon germination induction ( Fig . 4E ) . These results imply a direct 499 link between trehalose and cytoplasmic fluidity . However , even in a 45 % trehalose solution , the 500 diffusion rate of purified GFP was reported to be only about 2 - fold lower than that in a water solution 501 ( 23 ) . Therefore , trehalose as a simple viscogen cannot explain the decrease in the 40 - nm GEM mobility 502 in fission yeast spores . We propose a model in which the trehalose forms spore - specific intracellular 503 structures by interacting with other intracellular components . For example , it has been reported that a 504 mixture of proteins in addition to trehalose can cooperatively increase the viscosity of a solution ( 68 ) . 505 Future studies should explore the physical chemistry of complex solutions of trehalose with proteins , 506 lipids , and nucleic acids . 507 508 We found that glucose - triggered cAMP - PKA - Ntp1 signaling is required for cytoplasmic 509 fluidization during germination . How is Ntp1 regulated downstream of PKA signaling in spores ? There 510 was no apparent effect of translation inhibition ( CHX treatment ) on the 40 - nm GEM mobility during 511 germination ( Fig . 3F ) , suggesting that PKA and Ntp1 are already expressed in spores and their 512 activities are regulated posttranslationally during germination . These speculations can account for the 513 fact that spore cytoplasm could not be fully fluidized merely by overexpressing Ntp1 in the cAMP - 514 PKA pathway - deficient spores ( Fig . 4J and K ) . Consistent with these ideas , it has been reported that 515 PKA - dependent phosphorylation activates trehalase Ntp1 in fission yeast and its budding yeast 516 ortholog Nth1 ( 69 , 70 ) . Additionally , Ntp1 has a consensus site ( S71 ) for PKA - dependent 517 phosphorylation , and replacing S71 with an alanine residue results in loss of trehalase activity ( 71 ) . 518 However , it remains controversial whether PKA directly activates Ntp1 via phosphorylation ( 70 – 72 ) . 519 Future research should investigate the relation between PKA phosphorylation and Ntp1 trehalase 520 activity in in vitro experiments . 521 522 By using foreign tracer particles , our study revealed that the biophysical properties of spores are 523 quite different from those of vegetative cells . In addition to these exogenous particles , it would be 524 interesting to investigate the mobility of endogenous proteins of different sizes in spores , as was 525 recently done in a study on bacterial cells ( 73 ) , because various features of proteins , such as charge and 526 hydrophobicity , influence their mobility . In addition , the motions of intracellular particles are affected 527 by both cytoplasmic viscoelasticity and active forces generated from molecular motors and metabolic 528 reactions . However , in this study we relied on passive observations of the motion of probe particles , 529 and thus we were not able to distinguish between the relative contributions of the passive and active 530 mechanisms . A solution to this limitation would be to compare passive measurements with active 531 microrheological measurements , in which the probe particles are controlled exogenously by optical 532 tweezers or other means ( 44 , 74 ) . The prospect of applying such an approach to the spore cytoplasm is 533 intriguing , although active microrheology experiments for yeast cells are still challenging at this time 534 because the cell wall hinders the injection of specialized particles . Future studies will need to examine 535 the cytoplasmic biophysics of dormant cells and how it regulates intracellular processes and functions . 536 537 Materials and methods 538 539 Plasmids 540 All plasmids used in this study are summarized in Table S1 , along with Benchling links containing the 541 plasmid sequences and maps . The nucleotide sequence of 40 - nm GEM was optimized for fission yeast 542 codon usage . To construct pMNAT2LA21 - 40nm - GEM _ sp _ opt , the DNA sequence of 40 - nm GEM 543 was subcloned into pMNAT2LA21 ( 75 ) by using conventional ligation with Ligation high Ver . 2 544 ( TOYOBO , Osaka , Japan ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The gene was driven by a 545 medium - strength constitutive promoter ( Padh21 ) and expressed from the 2L locus ( 76 ) . In a previously 546 reported study , 40 - nm GEM was developed by fusing a natural homomultimeric scaffold with the 547 fluorescent protein T - Sapphire ( 12 ) . In our present experiments , we noticed that the fluorescent protein 548 of 40 - nm GEM did not have the mutations ( Q69M , C70V , V163A , S175G ) that are characteristic of T - 549 Sapphire ( 77 ) , and its amino acid sequence was more similar to that of Sapphire rather than T - Sapphire . 550 For the construction of plasmids to express mNG under the Posi series ( pHBCO1 - HA - spmNeonGreen , 551 pHBCO2 - HA - spmNeonGreen , pHBCO3 - HA - spmNeonGreen , pHBCO4 - HA - spmNeonGreen ) , a 552 region approximately 1 , 000 bp upstream from the start codon in 4 genes ( SPAC869 . 09 , hry1 , isp3 , 553 pdc202 ) was amplified by PCR and substituted for Padh1 in pHBCA1 - HA - spmNeonGreen - new by 554 using Gibson assembly with NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly ( New England Biolabs , Ipswich , MA ) . In 555 these plasmids , mNG is expressed from the C locus ( 78 ) . We used mNG optimized for fission yeast 556 codon usage ( 76 ) . To construct pHBCO2 - ntp1 , the DNA sequence of mNG in pHBCO2 - HA - 557 spmNeonGreen was replaced with the cDNA of ntp1 with Gibson assembly . To construct 558 pMNATZA1 - GFP - μNS , the DNA sequence of μNS was obtained from pRS306 - PHIS3 - GFP - μNS 559 ( Addgene plasmid # 116935 ; deposited by Liam Holt ) , and subcloned into pMNATZA1 . We note that 560 the fluorescent protein of μNS is GFPmut2 , which was derived from avGFP with some mutations 561 ( S65A , V68L , S72A ) ( 79 ) . 562 563 Reagents 564 CHX was purchased from Nacalai Tesque ( # 06741 - 91 ) , dissolved in ethanol ( 100 mg / mL stock 565 solution ) , and stored at - 30℃ . 2 - DG was purchased from FUJIFILM Wako ( # 040 - 06481 ) , dissolved in 566 double - distilled water ( DDW ) ( 1 mM stock solution ) , and stored at - 30℃ . LatA was purchased from 567 FUJIFILM Wako ( # 129 - 04361 ) , dissolved in DMSO ( 25 mg / mL stock solution ) , and stored at - 30℃ . 568 TBZ and CBZ were purchased from TCI ( # T0830 ) and Sigma - Aldrich ( # 378674 - 100G ) , respectively , 569 and dissolved in DMSO . The drug cocktail of TBZ and CBZ was prepared just before use . Torin1 was 570 purchased from Selleckchem ( # S2827 ) , dissolved in DMSO ( 3 mM stock solution ) , and stored at - 571 30℃ . 572 573 Fission yeast strains and culture conditions 574 All fission yeast strains used in this study are summarized in Table S2 along with their origins . Unless 575 otherwise noted , the growth medium , sporulation medium , and other aspects of the experimental 576 methods for fission yeast were based on those described previously ( 80 ) . The transformation protocol 577 was modified from a previously reported one ( 81 ) . 578 579 Purification of spores and induction of germination 580 Sporulation was induced in sporulation agar medium ( SPA ) at 26℃ for 3 days . SPA is composed of 581 1 % glucose , 0 . 1 % KH 2 PO 4 , 2 % agar , and supplemental vitamins ( pantothenic acid , nicotinic acid , 582 inositol , and biotin ) ( 82 ) . Spores were purified by the Percoll gradient method ( 83 ) with modifications 583 as described below . Briefly , cells on the SPA plate were suspended in 1 mL of DDW with 2 % 584 glusulase ( PerkinElmer , # NEE154001EA ) and digested with shaking at room temperature for 3 hr . The 585 cells were then washed twice with 500 uL of 0 . 5 % Triton - X and resuspended in 200 uL of 0 . 5 % Triton - 586 X . This suspension was layered on 1 mL of Percoll ( GE Healthcare , # 17089101 ) and centrifuged at 587 9 , 560 g for 5 min . After centrifugation , the pellet was collected and resuspended in 200 uL of 0 . 5 % 588 Triton - X , followed by centrifugation with Percoll using the same protocol as for the first Percoll 589 centrifugation . The pellet was washed twice with 0 . 5 % Triton - X , resuspended in 200 uL of Triton - X , 590 and stored at 4℃ until used for experiments . Before germination induction , purified spores were 591 washed twice with 1 mL of DDW and suspended in YEA medium without glucose ( YEA - glucose 592 medium ) ( 82 ) . Germination was induced by adding glucose to a final concentration of 2 % . Spores were 593 incubated at 32℃ , and a portion of the spores was collected at each time point and used in subsequent 594 experiments . 595 596 Live - cell fluorescence imaging of fission yeast cells 597 Cells were imaged with an IX83 inverted microscope ( Olympus ) equipped with an sCMOS camera 598 ( ORCA - Fusion BT ; Hamamatsu Photonics ) , an oil - immersion objective lenses ( UPLXAPO 100× , NA 599 = 1 . 45 , WD = 0 . 13 mm ; or UPLXAPO 60× PH , NA = 1 . 42 , WD = 0 . 15 mm ; Olympus ) , and a spinning 600 disk confocal unit ( CSU - W1 ; Yokogawa Electric Corporation ) . The excitation lasers and fluorescence 601 filter settings were as follows : excitation laser , 488 nm for mNG , 40 - nm GEM ( T - Sapphire ) , and μNS 602 ( GFP ) ; dichroic mirror , DM405 / 488 / 561 / 640 for mNG , 40 - nm GEM , and μNS ( Yokogawa Electric 603 Corporation ) ; emission filters , 525 / 50 for mNG , 40 - nm GEM , and μNS ( Yokogawa Electric 604 Corporation ) . This microscope was controlled by MetaMorph software ( ver . 7 . 10 . 3 ) . For the phase - 605 contrast imaging in Fig . 1E , cells were visualized with an BX53 upright microscope ( Olympus ) 606 equipped with a digital camera ( DP22 ; Olympus ) and an air / dry objective lens ( UPLFLN 40× PH , NA 607 = 0 . 75 , WD = 0 . 51 mm ; Olympus ) . 608 For snapshot imaging , cells were concentrated by centrifugation at 860 g , mounted on a slide 609 glass ( thickness , 0 . 9 – 1 . 2 mm ; Matsunami ) , and sealed by a glass coverslip ( thickness , 0 . 13 – 0 . 17 mm ; 610 Matsunami ) . For time - lapse imaging of the germination process in Fig . 2B – C , cells were embedded in 611 a YEA medium solidified with 2 % low melting temperature agarose ( Lonza , # 50101 ) on a polylysine - 612 coated glass bottom dish ( Matsunami , # D11531H ) ( 84 ) . 613 For imaging of cells expressing 40 - nm GEM , the fluorescence images were recorded every 100 614 milliseconds for 10 seconds in the streaming mode . The particles were tracked with the Mosaic suite , a 615 FIJI plugin ( 85 ) . In the analysis with the Mosaic suite , the following typical parameters were used : 616 radius = 3 ; cutoff = 0 ; per / abs , variable ; link range = 1 ; and maximum displacement = 6 pixels , 617 assuming Brownian dynamics . Particles with tracks shorter than 10 frames were excluded from further 618 analysis . 619 To quantify the intensity of particles in Fig . 3A – B , the parameter of radius in Mosaic suite was 620 fixed at 3 , and the mean intensities of each trajectory were calculated and used as a proxy for a particle 621 size of 40 - nm GEM . For treatment of inhibitors in Fig . 3E – I , CHX , 2 - DG , LatA , TBZ , CBZ , and 622 Torin1 were added to cell suspensions at final concentrations of 100 μg / mL , 10 mg / mL , 10 μg / mL , 50 623 μg / mL , 60 μg / mL and 15 μg / mL , respectively . 624 For imaging of cells expressing μNS , the fluorescence images were recorded every 500 625 milliseconds for 2 min with the streaming mode . As in 40 - nm GEM , the particles were tracked with the 626 Mosaic suite using the following parameters : radius = 3 ; cutoff = 0 ; per / abs , variable ; link range = 1 ; 627 and maximum displacement = 5 pixels , assuming Brownian dynamics . Particles with tracks shorter 628 than 10 frames were excluded from further analysis . 629 630 Particle trajectory analysis 631 For individual trajectories of GEM and μNS particles , we computed the time - averaged mean - squared 632 displacement ( MSD ) curves as in previous studies ( 7 , 12 ) . To compute the effective diffusion 633 coefficient of individual particles , we truncated the MSD curves to the first 10 points , assumed that the 634 linear relationship as 635 𝑀𝑆𝐷 ( 𝑡 ) = 4 𝐷 𝑒𝑓𝑓 𝑡 , 636 and used the least squares fitting . In order to estimate the power exponent of anomalous diffusion 𝛼 , we 637 averaged the individual MSDs for each condition . The ensemble - averaged MSDs were fitted to the 638 following equation : 639 𝑙𝑜𝑔 𝑀𝑆𝐷 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝛼 𝑙𝑜𝑔 𝑡 + 𝑙𝑜𝑔 4 𝐾 , 640 where K is the apparent diffusion coefficient in units of 𝜇 𝑚 2 / 𝑠 𝛼 . In doing so , we used the ensemble - 641 averaged MSDs from 100 ms to 1000 ms for the GEMs and from 1000 ms to 5500 ms for the μNS . In 642 the figure legends , “n” indicates the number of trajectories , which was used to compute the effective 643 diffusion coefficients . 644 645 Quantification of trehalose amount 646 The amount of trehalose was measured by using a Trehalose Assay kit ( K - TREH ; Megazyme ) with 647 reference to the manufacturer’s instructions and the previously reported method ( 23 ) . To compare the 648 trehalose amount in vegetative cells and spores , cells grown exponentially in YEA medium were used 649 as vegetative cells and spores were purified before use . Cell counts were measured by using Moxi GO 650 II ( ORFLO ) , and 1 . 0 × 10 8 cells and 1 . 0 × 10 7 cells were used as samples for the vegetative cells and 651 spores , respectively . The cell volume was also measured using the same device ( vegetative cells : about 652 30 – 40 fL ; spores : about 10 – 12 fL ) . Cells were washed with 1 mL of YEA - glucose medium , and then 653 supplemented with 100 μL of DDW heated at 95°C and vortexed vigorously . After incubation at 95°C 654 for 15 min , the samples were centrifuged and about 100 μL of the supernatant was collected in new 655 tubes . The pellets were treated with another 100 μL of DDW heated at 95°C and vortexed at room 656 temperature for 5 min . After centrifugation , about 100 μL of the supernatant was collected in the tubes , 657 and a total of about 200 μL of the cell extracts was obtained . Samples were measured on the day of 658 extraction and stored at 4°C before use . 20 μL of each sample was measured in technical triplicate 659 using a 96 - well microplate ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , # 167008 ) , and each measurement was performed 660 in biological triplicate . Absorbance was measured at 340 nm using a Multiskan FC ( Thermo Fisher 661 Scientific ) . For absolute quantification of the trehalose amount , trehalose solutions ( 1 . 25 , 2 . 5 , 5 . 0 , 10 , 662 20 μg of trehalose ) were also measured to create a calibration curve . To calculate the trehalose 663 concentration , cell counts and volumes were corrected . To measure the intracellular trehalose amount 664 during germination , 1 . 0 × 10 7 cells were washed twice with DDW , suspended in YEA - glucose 665 medium , and induced to germinate by adding glucose to a final concentration of 2 % . At each time point 666 during germination , cells were collected and the trehalose amount was quantified as described above . 667 668 FCS measurement in fission yeast cells and analysis 669 FCS data were obtained using a Leica SP8 Falcon confocal microscope equipped with an objective 670 lens , HC PL APO 63× / 1 . 20 W motCORR CS2 , and analyzed on Leica software essentially as described 671 previously ( 76 , 86 , 87 ) . Fission yeast cells expressing mNG were measured with 488 nm excitation and 672 500 – 600 nm emission . The structural parameter and effective confocal volume were calibrated using 673 500 nM Rhodamine 6G ( TCI , R0039 ) in DDW based on the result that the diffusion constant of 674 Rhodamine 6G in DDW is 414 µm 2 / s at room temperature ( 88 ) . The Rhodamine 6G solution was 675 measured with 488 nm excitation and 500 – 600 nm emission . The structural parameter and the effective 676 confocal volume were estimated as 1 . 88 and 0 . 88 fL , respectively . 677 The time - series data of fluorescence fluctuations were obtained for 30 seconds , corrected by the 678 photobleach correction algorithm of the Leica FCS analysis software , and subjected to the calculation 679 of the auto - correlation function G ( τ ) of the Leica FCS analysis software . The calculated auto - 680 correlation functions were fitted with the equation for the single - component normal diffusion and 681 triplet model on Leica FCS analysis software , and effective diffusion coefficients of mNG were 682 estimated . 683 684 FRAP measurement in fission yeast cells and analysis 685 FRAP data were obtained using an FV3000 laser - scanning confocal microscope ( Olympus ) equipped 686 with a UPLXAPO 60× objective lens , ( NA = 1 . 42 , WD = 0 . 15 mm ; Olympus ) . Fission yeast cells 687 expressing mNG were measured with 488 nm excitation and 500 – 540 nm emission . Both in vegetative 688 cells and spores , about half of the cell area was photobleached and subsequent fluorescence recovery 689 was observed . For photobleaching of cells , we used 100 % laser intensity for 19 ms in vegetative cells 690 and 40 % laser intensity for 12 ms in spores . Fluorescence was recorded at an image acquisition rate of 691 50 – 100 ms , and a total of 150 images were acquired . Light stimulation was applied after 20 frames . 692 We estimated the effective diffusion coefficient by matching the observed FRAP data with the 693 simulated data as explained below . To detect the cellular region of each cell , we averaged 20 pre - 694 bleach frames and applied Otsu’s thresholding to binarize the time - averaged image . On the detected 695 cellular regions with the no - flux boundary condition , we numerically simulated the spatio - temporal 696 pattern of probe intensity , 𝑐 ( 𝑥 , 𝑦 , 𝑡 ) , by using the diffusion equation 697 𝜕𝑐 𝜕𝑡 = 𝐷𝛥𝑐 − 𝑘𝑐 , 698 where D is the diffusion coefficient and k is the decay rate . We included the decay term to consider the 699 observational photobleaching after light stimulation . Prior to the numerical simulation , the decay rate 700 was estimated by linear regression on each time course of total fluorescent intensity within the cellular 701 region . Then , we adopted the forward - time centered - space discretization ( 𝛥 𝑡 = 0 . 005 [ Frame ] , 𝛥 𝑥 = 702 1 [ Pixel ] ) and numerically integrated the diffusion - decay model with different values of D . Using the 703 same regions of interest ( ROIs ) as used for the experimental FRAP time courses 𝐹 𝑒𝑥𝑝 , we computed the 704 time courses of mean intensity I ( t ) from the simulated images and rescaled them to obtain the simulated 705 FRAP time course 𝐹 𝑠𝑖𝑚 as 706 𝐹 𝑠𝑖𝑚 ( 𝑡 ) = 𝐹 𝑒𝑥𝑝 ( ∞ ) − 𝐹 𝑒𝑥𝑝 ( 0 ) 𝐼 ( ∞ ) − 𝐼 ( 0 ) ( 𝐼 ( ∞ ) − 𝐼 ( 0 ) ) + 𝐹 𝑒𝑥𝑝 ( 0 ) . 707 Finally , the optimal value of D for each cell was determined by grid search to minimize the mean - 708 squared error between 𝐹 𝑠𝑖𝑚 and 𝐹 𝑒𝑥𝑝 , i . e . , 709 ∑ 𝑡 ( 𝐹 𝑠𝑖𝑚 ( 𝑡 ) − 𝐹 𝑒𝑥𝑝 ( 𝑡 ) ) 2 . 710 711 Images and data analysis 712 All fluorescence imaging data were analyzed and quantified using Fiji / Image J ( https : / / fiji . sc / ) . For all 713 images , the background was subtracted using the rolling - ball method ( rolling ball radius , 50 . 0 pixels ) . 714 For the quantification of signal intensity in fission yeast cells , appropriate ROIs were manually 715 selected , and mean intensities in ROIs were measured . To detect cells expressing mNG in Fig . 3C – D , 716 mNG signals were directly segmented using Stardist ( 89 , 90 ) and used as a proxy for cell area . Among 717 the movie series ( 101 images ) of 40 - nm GEM particles , the first image was shown as a representative 718 image . Data visualization and graph creation were performed using Python 3 . 10 with the Numpy 719 1 . 21 . 3 , Pandas 1 . 3 . 4 , Matplotlib 3 . 4 . 3 , and Seaborn 0 . 11 . 2 modules . 720 721 Acknowledgments 722 We thank all members of the Aoki Laboratory for their helpful discussions and assistance .
