This participation can be charac - terized as involving children as users , testers , informants , or design partners . It is only relatively recent that researchers around the world have begun to work more substantively with children to design tech - nologies for children . This monograph synthesizes prior work involving children as informants and design partners , and describes the emer - gence of participatory design methods and techniques for children . We consider the various roles children have played in the design process , with a focus on those that integrally involve children throughout the process . We summarize and provide a pragmatic foundation for fellow Full text available at : http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1561 / 1100000018 researchers and practitioners to use several methods and techniques for designing technologies with and for children . In this monograph we relate the techniques to the design goals they help fulﬁll . The monograph concludes with a consideration of working with children in technology design processes as we move into the twenty - ﬁrst century .

Although the technology to be designed is for children , you expect to see computer scien - tists working diligently at computers , educators oﬀering their input on the latest developmentally appropriate research on children , and information technology spe - cialists guiding the interface design . The room might be hushed while everyone works diligently . Instead , you witness the following : The brightly colored lab is abuzz with noise and laughter , not only from the aforementioned hardwork - ing computer scientists , educators , and information technology specialists , but also from children ! The group is ﬁnishing up eating a snack together , at which point one adult explains that during today’s session , the team will be working to solve interface design issues for a major online company . The group is then split up into smaller teams of three to four members , each with adults and children who will work together on the problem . 1 Full text available at : http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1561 / 1100000018 2 Introduction These groups disperse across the room and begin to build ideas using giant bags of art supplies . Chil - dren and adults are on the ﬂoor working together , creating models , discussing possibilities , and devising solutions . As the ideas ﬂow , the activity level in the room increases . Children and adults alike are writing , building , talking , and collaborating . Ideas emerge from each group . An adult leader calls everyone back together , and children and adults from each group work together to present the ideas they came up with to the large group . From a disco ball interface that would allow combining searches , to redesigned keyboards , to auditory feedback and hints on spelling , the groups have come up with many ideas to solve the problem of how children search for information on the open web . This scenario describes an actual design session of Kidsteam , an intergenerational technology design team using the Cooperative Inquiry method of design partnering [ 28 , 29 , 32 ] at the University of Maryland . These child design partners participate in sessions such as the one described above on a regular basis in order to design new tech - nologies for children . We believe it is important to include children in designing technology intended for use by children especially as technology is becoming more and more prevalent in the lives of all children . Today’s technologies in the home are becoming ubiquitous , not just for adults , but also for children of varying ages , in diverse contexts , and in diﬀerent countries [ 33 ] . A 2008 report from the Pew Charita - ble Trust found that families with children are more likely than other family conﬁgurations to have various types of technology in the home . These technologies include computers , the Internet , broadband access , and mobile phones [ 70 ] , and the use of these technologies is signiﬁcant . In fact , another study reports that computers were used by 27 % of 5 – 6 - year - olds on a daily basis , for an average of 50 minutes [ 114 ] , 80 % of households of children 6 - years - old and under owned a computer or Full text available at : http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1561 / 1100000018 3 laptop , and approximately 69 % of all households with young children had Internet access . Of 3 - to 10 - year olds in 2011 , 55 % used handheld gaming devices , 68 % played on console gaming devices , and 85 % used computers [ 111 ] . Even longtime media giants such as the Sesame Work - shop have divisions dedicated to interactive technology [ 100 ] . Children’s technology use in school also continues to increase . This increase exists in early childhood [ 33 ] , and continues through public schools in kinder - garten through twelfth grade . According to the National Center for Education Statistics ( NCES ) , in 2009 , 97 % of teachers in the U . S . reported having a computer in the classroom , and of those , 93 % had Internet access [ 86 ] . This increased presence of technology in children’s lives is also a world - wide . Among children aged 8 to 18 across Japan , India , Paraguay , and Egypt , 69 % use mobile phones [ 49 ] . Indeed chil - dren’s use of these technologies in diverse contexts is signiﬁcant and it continues to increase . With technology impacting children of many ages and contexts on a global scale , there has been considerable research in the educational sector that has focused on the proliferation of technology and its impact among children both at home [ 33 , 70 ] and in school [ 33 , 86 ] . This research leaves an aspect of technology that is sometimes overlooked in research : the design of technology . For a technology to come into being , someone , or some people , somewhere , spent a lot of time and eﬀort ﬁrst conceiving the idea for the technology , then developing and building the technology , then implementing the technology in the con - text for which it is intended , and ﬁnally testing the new technology with the intended users , which in this case is children . All technology must be designed and implemented , however it is not given that children are an integral part of the design process [ 29 ] . Research has shown that children can be involved in the technology design process in a variety of ways [ 29 ] . This monograph reviews the research and practices of involving children in the technology design process , with a particular focus on methods and techniques that inte - grally involve children in these processes . This monograph oﬀers design - ers of children’s technology motivation and practical ideas for including children in the technology design process . Full text available at : http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1561 / 1100000018 4 Introduction 1 . 1 Terminology Before proceeding , it is necessary to deﬁne some of the terms that will be repeatedly used throughout this monograph . While many of these terms seem common in their usage , diﬀerent readers may have diﬀerent perspectives and experiences , so we discuss each of these terms as they will be applied in this monograph . Speciﬁcally , we deﬁne and distin - guish what we mean by : child , technology design process , and technique vs . method . 1 . 1 . 1 Child Hourcade [ 60 ] expresses that we should consider developmental needs of children in the technologies being designed for them . We extend this notion to also considering the developmental needs of children as they are included in the design process . The age of the children of principal focus in this monograph are elementary school aged children ( 6 to 12 years of age ) , and the methods and techniques discussed are primarily for children in this age range . Some of the methods have variations for children who are as young as 3 , and as old as 16 . Most children involved in reported research on children in technology design processes are in the developmental stage often referred to as middle childhood , ages 7 to 11 years old . Druin [ 28 , p . 596 ] found that 7 – 10 - year - olds work well as design partners in technology design process contexts as they are “ . . . verbal and self - reﬂective enough to discuss what they are thinking” . This age range falls within Piaget’s concrete operational stage which is typically children aged 6 to 12 which means they can think logically with concrete information , but have more dif - ﬁculties with abstract concepts which is why many techniques have concrete objects to help bridge their thinking [ 75 ] . Erikson’s industry vs . inferiority stage includes children aged 6 to puberty . During this stage children become more able to cooperate with others thus sup - porting a collaborative work approach [ 13 ] . Therefore , for the purposes of this monograph , when we discuss children in the design process we will generally be referring to children aged 6 to 12 . When we discuss adult design processes we are referring to processes involving design partners above the age of 18 . Children have views and developmental Full text available at : http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1561 / 1100000018 1 . 1 Terminology 5 needs that are diﬀerent from those of adults . Techniques for working with children on design teams thus need to be speciﬁc to the needs of children . This concept will be expanded later in this monograph . We will also not directly address design processes intended speciﬁ - cally for teenagers aged 13 to 18 in this monograph . Design for teenagers is a nascent ﬁeld . As noted by Yarosh et al . [ 124 ] , teenagers are a popu - lation with whom , to date , not much work has been done in the area of participatory design . This is changing , with recent work by Iversen and Smith [ 63 ] and a workshop to explore the space of teenagers in design at NordiCHI [ 95 ] and at CHI [ 94 ] . Adolescents signiﬁcantly diﬀer enough from children developmentally that design with teenagers should be considered separately from that of children , and thus , teenagers are not included in this monograph . 1 . 1 . 2 Technology Design Process The phrase “technology design process” will be used repeatedly throughout this monograph . The phrase is deceptively simple , but involves two major concepts that must be examined separately — “technology” and “design process” . In the twenty - ﬁrst century , we all assume that we know what “technology” is . But if we stop to consider this concept , a concrete deﬁnition becomes elusive . A dictionary deﬁnition for technology is “a method , process , etc . for handling a speciﬁc technical problem” [ 2 ] . A similar deﬁnition applied to technology in an educational context is that technology is a “ . . . systematic application of behavioral and physical sciences concepts and other knowledge to the solution of problems” [ 43 ] . These deﬁnitions have much in common ; for example , they refer to solving a problem . In the case of technology created for children , the problem might be that children need support in storytelling , or a better way to learn environmental science . Another characteristic of both of these deﬁnitions is that they are not speciﬁc . Technology is not necessarily deﬁned only by a traditional personal computer with a keyboard and monitor — it can be much more . In fact , Weiser [ 123 ] discussed technology that blended into a person’s environment . Technology might refer to traditional mouse , screen , and Full text available at : http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1561 / 1100000018 6 Introduction keyboard for computer and software [ 101 ] , media for television [ 38 ] , Internet websites [ 5 ] , tangible and mobile technology such as techno - logically enhanced stuﬀed animals [ 46 ] , or tablet computers enhanced to help children on ﬁeld trips [ 23 ] . Ubiquitous technology which blends seamlessly into the environment is becoming more common today , especially for today’s children . The technologies that we focus on in this monograph are mainly digital in nature ; however , the design processes used for these technologies could also apply to non - digital technologies such as paper books or writing supplies , which also ﬁt our deﬁnition of technology . Technologies can be created in a variety of settings by a variety of people . Technologies for children are developed commercially by com - panies such as Microsoft [ 110 ] or Philips [ 87 ] , with government - funded agencies such as public television [ 4 ] and in academic settings , espe - cially at universities with large HCI communities such as University of Maryland , Carnegie Mellon , Georgia Tech , and others [ 19 , 23 , 47 ] . Regardless of the types of technologies or the places where they are developed , all technologies must be created through some kind of pro - cess , and therefore all of them have the potential for including children as a part of the design team . In the ﬁeld of technology , the phrase “design process” may at ﬁrst cause some confusion . It is necessary to distinguish between a “design process” and a “development process” . For the purposes of this mono - graph , a design process refers to the steps necessary to conceive and develop a technology including deﬁning the problem , researching it , cre - ating multiple solutions , evaluating solutions , reﬂecting on the lessons learned , and repeating any part of the process to reﬁne the product . When we refer to design process we are not talking about the manu - facturing or the mass production of the ﬁnal product ; we are speaking strictly of the process of conceiving and specifying the form and func - tion of the technology . Because of the importance of the design process in this monograph , we elaborate more on these stages or goals in the Section 2 . Others may deﬁne design process diﬀerently , such as the work between the time of requirements gathering and implementation [ 97 ] . We accept the validity of this deﬁnition and the authors of [ 97 ] accept that other deﬁnitions of design process , such as the one employed here , Full text available at : http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1561 / 1100000018 1 . 1 Terminology 7 are also valid . The deﬁnition used for this monograph is intentionally broad enough to encompass what we believe are all phases of the design process . The phrase “design process” is chosen for this research as opposed to “development process” for clarity . In the ﬁeld of computer science , “development” has many other connotations , including coding or pro - gramming of software . In addition , “development” in the educational sense is often used to refer to a child’s gains in cognitive , social , emotional , and motor domains . Therefore , to reduce confusion , the term “design process” will be used instead of “development process” . Thus , combining the deﬁnitions of “technology” and “design pro - cess” , a deﬁnition of “technology design process” can be reached : a technology design process is all of the work done from beginning to end in the creation of new problem - solving tools , which can range from creating software for a personal computer to designing physical tech - nologies such as robots . This monograph focuses on methods and tech - niques employed when creating technology for children , especially those that involve children throughout the entirety of the design process . 1 . 1 . 3 Method vs . Technique It is important for the purposes of this monograph to distinguish between how we use the terms method and technique in regard to designing technology . We deﬁne technique narrowly . A technique is deﬁned as an activity that a design team participates in while creating a technology . The application of a technique can be very brief and may last in terms of duration a fraction of a single design session to two or more design sessions . We refer to these applications as design activities . Walsh et al . [ 122 , p . 2893 ] deﬁne a technique as “a creative endeavor that is meant to communicate design ideas and system requirements to a larger group” . Examples of techniques include brainstorming using art supplies , or critiquing technology using sticky notes . We deﬁne a method , on the other hand , quite broadly . We again employ Walsh et al . ’s [ 122 , p . 2893 ] deﬁnition of a method , which is a “collection of techniques used in conjunction with a larger design philosophy” . Thus , a method includes the overall philosophy of a design team . It refers to Full text available at : http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1561 / 1100000018 8 Introduction the overall system that a team uses to design technology . A method can include one or many techniques , but it is more than a collection of techniques that makes up a method . It includes the attitude and values that the team brings to designing technology . In Section 2 , we present a general model of the design process with its accompanying goals . We use this to provide context to the subsequent sections . After discussing the design process and goals , in Section 3 we survey how designers have historically worked with users in technology design processes . Section 4 presents various design meth - ods for working with children in the design process . Section 5 addresses the speciﬁcs on how and when to employ various design techniques . In Section 6 , we revisit the underlying dimensions of child involvement and we conclude , in Section 7 , by summarizing our vision for the future of designing technologies with and for children .
