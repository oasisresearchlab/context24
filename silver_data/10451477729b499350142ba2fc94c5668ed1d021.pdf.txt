and m the number of detected photons 11 . Clearly , for this concept to work , the molecules must cycle from a dark to a bright state , yield - ing m detectable photons , and then back to a dark state . Therefore , PALM and STORM use ‘photoactivatable’ proteins or organic com - pounds where the fluorescence ability of the molecule is elicited by the absorption of a photon . The energy provided by this ‘activation’ photon switches the fluorophore on , for example , by altering a chem - ical bond or an isomerization state . Examples of such compounds are the photoactivatable proteins EosFP 8 and PA - GFP 9 , the ‘caged’ rhodamines 12 and the photoisomerizable cyanine dyes Cy3 and Cy5 , which have been used both as activator - emitter pairs 10 as well as sin - gle photoactivatable labels 13 , 14 . Although they have provided stunning images , these photoacti - vatable compounds have limitations in terms of biocompatibility , labeling and switching performance . Additionally , they may call for dedicated activation lasers 8 – 10 , 12 , 14 . Last but not least , the appar - ent need for ‘activatable’ compounds narrows the scope of these techniques . Here we show that far - field fluorescence nanoscopy by stochastic single - molecule switching can be performed without photoactivation , using basic transitions of standard markers : switch - ing the fluorophores to their triplet state T 1 or another metastable dark state while recording those that are still left or have returned to the ground state S 0 . Operating with ordinary fluorophores and rendering photoactivation either optional or obsolete , ground state depletion microscopy followed by individual molecule return ( GSDIM ) considerably expands the conceptual range and the appli - cability of far - field optical nanoscopy . Having a lifetime ( τ ) of 10 − 3 to100 ms and being common in vir - tually all fluorophores , the lowest triplet state T 1 is the primary can - didate for switching molecules 2 . In addition , T 1 serves as a gateway to other dark states D with similar or even longer τ of 1 to 10 4 ms 15 ( Fig . 1a ) . After the period τ , the molecules return to S 0 where they can be repeatedly excited to the fluorescent state S 1 , yielding the burst of m detectable photons required for computing their position . The same repeated excitation also switches the fluorophore off , because from S 1 the molecule crosses to T 1 with a typical probability Φ isc ≤ 0 . 1 % . If τ is ~ 10 7 times longer than the fluorescence lifetime ( τ fl ) of ~ 3 ns of S 1 , a continuous wave illumination intensity I > I s ≡ h ν / ( Φ isc σ τ ) ≈ 1 kW / cm 2 minimizes the fraction of S 0 molecules to ε ≈ τ fl / Φ isc τ < < 10 % ; h ν is the energy of the excitation photon and σ the photon absorption cross - section of the molecule in S 0 . Note that the minimal fraction ε of remaining S 0 molecules does not depend on I . Owing to the presence of a larger dark - state population , the signal from a bulk of rhodamine dyes , specifically Rhodamine 6G ( Rh6G ) and Atto532 embedded in poly ( vinyl - alcohol ) ( PVA ) , decreased with increasing intensity of the 532 - nm excitation beam used ( Fig . 1b ) . Notably , the majority of the dyes recovered within sev - eral tens of milliseconds ( Fig . 1c ) .

Continuous widefield illumination by a single laser and a continuously operating camera yielded dual - color images of rhodamine - and fluorescent protein – labeled ( living ) samples , proving a simple yet powerful super - resolution approach . For many decades it was assumed that the resolution of any far - field optical microscope is limited to about half the wavelength of light . This perception has changed after the discovery that basic fluoro - phore transitions can be used for neutralizing the limiting role of diffraction 1 , 2 . More specifically , transitions that switch the fluores - cence on or off enabled the sequential recording of objects that are much closer than the diffraction limit . Hence , not surprisingly , all far - field fluorescence nanoscopy modalities used so far rely on a time - sequential readout using a variant of fluorescence switching . In stimulated emission depletion ( STED ) microscopy 1 , the fluorescence ability of the dye is switched using a de - excitation beam . In ground state depletion ( GSD ) microscopy 2 , 3 , the fluorophores are switched to the dark triplet state . In contrast to STED , saturated patterned exci - tation microscopy ( SPEM or SSIM ) 4 , 5 switches the fluorescence to its maximum . All of these strategies have been extended to switching photoactivatable fluorescent proteins and photoswitchable ( pho - tochromic ) organic fluorophores 6 . They all switch the fluorescence using a light distribution featuring either one or many intensity zeros that are translated in space , defining the coordinates at which fluores - cence is switched on or off at a given point in time 7 . This is different in photoactivation localization ( PALM ) 8 , 9 or stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy ( STORM ) 10 where the fluorescence ability of the marker is switched stochastically in space , molecule by molecule . The fluorescence diffraction pattern of sparsely and randomly switched on ( activated ) molecules is recorded on a camera , allowing the calculation of their position with accu - racy ∆ / √ m , with ∆ denoting the width of the diffraction maximum 1 Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry , Department of NanoBiophotonics , Am Fassberg 11 , 37077 Göttingen , Germany . 2 These authors contributed equally to this work .

The latter is provided by the PVA environment , which reduces the mobility of triplet - quenching oxygen and yields addi - tional dark states 15 . Many fluorophores mounted in PVA , includ - ing Alexa488 , Texas Red , FITC , Rhodamine110 and Oregon Green yielded ε ≤ 10 % and τ greater than milliseconds ; they all are suitable for GSDIM ( Supplementary Table 1 online ) . m is likely larger than in genuine photo - switchable fluorophores because the probability of the latter to go to an off state is usually higher . GSDIM benefits from the fact that standard fluorophores are optimized for large fluores - cence quantum yields . Next we immersed our samples in Tris buffer containing glucose oxidase as oxygen scavenger , which , by increasing τ from about micro - seconds to ~ 10 – 100 ms , enabled ε < 10 % ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . The GSDIM images of microtubules immunostained with Rh6G dis - played a superior resolution ( Fig . 2c ) . GSDIM was also possible in cellular media such as HEPES - buffered Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with an oxygen - scavenging system . Clusters of integrin - β - 3 of human glioma cells labeled with Atto532 were far better resolved by GSDIM than by conventional recording ( Fig . 2d , e ) . Fluorescent proteins can also be efficiently transferred to a meta - stable dark state such as the triplet or different protonation states 17 . All fluorescent proteins tested , namely EGFP , EYFP , Citrine and PhiYFP had ε ≤ 10 % and τ > 1 ms in aqueous media and were thus suitable for GSDIM ( Supplementary Table 1 ) . The GSDIM image of living PtK2 cells expressing Citrine fused to the mictotubule - as - sociated protein Map2 , resulting in the labeling of the microtubule cytoskeleton , illustrates a marked resolution gain ( Fig . 2f , g ) , yet the resolution ( ~ 40 nm ) and the contrast were still somewhat lower than in immunostained cells ( Fig . 2a – e ) . This stems from the fact that switching to the dark state is usually faster for the fluorescent proteins than for the organic dyes , restricting the number m of photons in a bunch ( Supplementary Methods ) . Furthermore , the average off - time of a Citrine molecule in this molecular construct is rather long ( > 1 s ; Supplementary Table 1 ) , which limits the number of on - off cycles before irreversible bleaching and reduces the contrast of the reconstructed GSDIM image . In comparison , Rh6G molecules return faster , are more photostable and return more often . Nevertheless , the stronger photobleaching of Citrine seems not to be of fundamental nature because the lifetime of the dark state of these proteins in a pure aqueous environment is much shorter ( 50 ms ) , implying that Citrine is generally more photostable than in the example above . Although the substantial variation in lifetime can be attributed to changes in the pH or in the concentration of molecular oxygen ( Supplementary Table 1 ) , this example highlights the relevance of the molecular envi - ronment in a particular application of GSDIM . Fluorescence depletion , instead of activation , provides a con - ventional first image , giving an overview of the sample and an indication when to stop the stochastic picture assembly . As we allowed less than one singlet - state molecule to be present in the diffraction area , the allowable total number of usable fluorophores within this area was 1 / ε ≈Φ isc τ / τ fl , which is a function of the dye and the environment . A remedy for densely labeled samples is to bleach some of the fluorophores before imaging ( Fig . 2 ) or ‘shelve’ them in a very long - lived dark state . Likewise , the return rate 1 / τ of the few , remaining fluorophores may be too low at later cam - era frames , slowing down the image acquisition . In this case , the return can then be accelerated by additional light depopulating the dark state ( T 1 or D ) via dark - state absorption 17 ( Supplementary Fig . 1 online ) . We applied this procedure by also illuminating with β - mercaptoethanol reduced τ and hence increased ε . This experi - ment demonstrated the critical role of T 1 in the switching mecha - nism . On a single - molecule level the transient population of T 1 or D induced a fast stochastic on - off switching ; the average on - times were a few milliseconds and the off - times were somewhat larger ( Fig . 1d ) . The time spent in the fluorescent ( on ) singlet system was < 10 % of the total recording time . Yet the number of photons detected per 2 ms on time amounted to m > 500 because once they were back in the singlet system , the fluorophores emitted brightly , with the distribution of m peaking at 1 , 000 photons . Dual - color GSDIM images of microtubule filaments and peroxy - somes of mammalian cells embedded in PVA , immunolabeled with the rhodamine derivatives Atto532 ( emission maximum ~ 550 nm ) and Atto565 ( emission maximum ~ 590 nm ) showed details absent in conventional images ( Fig . 2a , b ) . We recorded the images using a 532 - nm continuous - wave laser for both excitation and depletion , and a continuously running camera . The resolution of the GSDIM images was < 30 nm ( Supplementary Methods online ) . The 40nm disparity between the emission peaks of both dyes was sufficient to distinguish them with a confidence > 90 % when com - paring the signal of a single isolated emitter detected in a short - pass ( < 575 nm ) channel with that in a long - pass ( > 590 nm ) channel 16 . The conventional bulk recording requires mathematical unmixing . The fact that the photon burst m is provided by the singlet system of a regular dye explains why m may easily exceed 500 photons . As ε ≈τ fl / Φ isc τ , large values of τ and Φ isc of a fluorophore improve the switching , but a large Φ isc also reduces m , which is approximated by η det Φ fl / Φ isc , and hence independent of I . ( η det and Φ fl denote the detection efficiency of the instrument and the fluorescence quan - tum yield , respectively . ) Therefore , we used dyes with Φ isc < 0 . 1 % Figure 1 | Switching a regular fluorophore using its dark states .

Note that this illumination is optional and applied to regular fluorophores . Unlike GSD microscopy 2 , 3 , GSDIM requires a fluorophore to recover to S 0 only once . By sto - chastically recording the position of individual molecules , GSDIM substantially differs from GSD microscopy , which defines the posi - tion of molecular detection with intensity zeros . Yet both concepts rely on the same molecular mechanism , a fact that highlights switching between a dark and a bright state as the actual element enabling super - resolution imaging . As switching is not restricted to fluorescence , other contrast modes , such as changes in the scat - tering spectrum of ( paired ) collodial particles , are poised to be implemented as well 6 . In any case , the intensity - zero , ensemble - based approach and the stochastic single - molecule - based approach remain comple - mentary modalities of determining the position of nearby mol - ecules . The latter modality has the advantage of requiring fewer switching cycles , which also accounts for the fact that GSDIM cur - rently appears to be more readily applicable than GSD microscopy . Moreover , GSDIM is strikingly simple : continual epifluorescence recording with a freely operating camera allows the computational construction of nanoscale images with multiple standard dyes and fluorescent proteins .
