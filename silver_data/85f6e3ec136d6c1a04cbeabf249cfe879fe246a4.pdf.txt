U pon a viral outbreak , it is important to rapidly establish whether the outbreak is caused by a new or a previously known virus ( Box 1 ) , as this helps decide which approaches and actions are most appropriate to detect the causative agent , con - trol its transmission and limit potential consequences of the epi - demic . The assessment of virus novelty also has implications for virus naming and , on a different timescale , helps to define research priorities in virology and public health . For many human virus infections such as influenza virus 1 or norovirus 2 infections , well - established and internationally approved methods , standards and procedures are in place to identify and name the causative agents of these infections and report this infor - mation promptly to public health authorities and the general public . In outbreaks involving newly emerged viruses , the situation may be different , and appropriate procedures to deal with these viruses need to be established or refined with high priority . Here , we present an assessment of the genetic relatedness of the newly identified human coronavirus 3 , provisionally named 2019 - nCoV , to known coronaviruses , and detail the basis for ( re ) naming this virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) , which will be used hereafter . Given the public interest in nam - ing newly emerging viruses and the diseases caused by these viruses in humans , we will give a brief introduction to virus discovery and classification — specifically the virus species concept — and the roles of different bodies , such as the World Health Organization ( WHO ) and the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses ( ICTV ) , in this process . We hope this will help readers to better understand the scientific approach we have taken to arrive at this name , and we will also discuss implications of this analysis and naming decision . Classifying and naming viruses and virus species Defining the novelty of viruses is one of the topics that virus classification deals with . The classification of RNA viruses needs to consider their inherent genetic variability , which often results in two or more viruses with non - identical but similar genome sequences being regarded as variants of the same virus . This immediately poses the question of how much difference to an existing group is large enough to recognize the candidate virus as a member of a new , distinct group . This question is answered in best practice by evalu - ating the degree of relatedness of the candidate virus to previously identified viruses infecting the same host or established monophy - letic groups of viruses , often known as genotypes or clades , which may or may not include viruses of different hosts . This is formally addressed in the framework of the official classification of virus tax - onomy and is overseen and coordinated by the ICTV 4 . Viruses are clustered in taxa in a hierarchical scheme of ranks in which the spe - cies represents the lowest and most populous rank containing the least diverged groups ( taxa ) of viruses ( Box 2 ) . The ICTV maintains a Study Group for each virus family . The Study Groups are respon - sible for assigning viruses to virus species and taxa of higher ranks , such as subgenera , genera and subfamilies . In this context they play an important role in advancing the virus species concept and high - lighting its significance 5 . Virus nomenclature is a formal system of names used to label viruses and taxa . The fact that there are names for nearly all viruses within a species is due to the historical perception of viruses as causative agents of specific diseases in specific hosts , and to the way we usually catalogue and classify newly discovered viruses , which increasingly includes viruses that have not been linked to any known disease in their respective hosts ( Box 1 ) . The WHO , an agency of the United Nations , coordinates international public health activities aimed at combating , containing and mitigating the consequences of communicable diseases—including major virus epidemics—and is responsible for naming disease ( s ) caused by newly emerging human viruses . In doing so , the WHO often takes the traditional approach of linking names of specific diseases to viruses ( Box 1 ) and The species Severe acute respiratory syndrome - related coronavirus : classifying 2019 - nCoV and naming it SARS - CoV - 2 Coronaviridae Study Group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses * The present outbreak of a coronavirus - associated acute respiratory disease called coronavirus disease 19 ( COVID - 19 ) is the third documented spillover of an animal coronavirus to humans in only two decades that has resulted in a major epidemic . The Coronaviridae Study Group ( CSG ) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses , which is responsible for develop - ing the classification of viruses and taxon nomenclature of the family Coronaviridae , has assessed the placement of the human pathogen , tentatively named 2019 - nCoV , within the Coronaviridae . Based on phylogeny , taxonomy and established practice , the CSG recognizes this virus as forming a sister clade to the prototype human and bat severe acute respiratory syndrome corona - viruses ( SARS - CoVs ) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome - related coronavirus , and designates it as SARS - CoV - 2 . In order to facilitate communication , the CSG proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates : SARS - CoV - 2 / host / location / isolate / date . While the full spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with SARS - CoV - 2 infections in humans remains to be determined , the independent zoonotic transmission of SARS - CoV and SARS - CoV - 2 highlights the need for studying viruses at the species level to complement research focused on individual pathogenic viruses of immediate significance . This will improve our understanding of virus – host interactions in an ever - changing environment and enhance our preparedness for future outbreaks .

Apart from disease , geography and the organism from which a given virus was isolated also dominate the nomenclature , occasion - ally engraving connections that may be accidental ( rather than typi - cal ) or even stigmatizing , which should be avoided . Establishing a universal nomenclature for viruses was one of the major tasks of the ICTV when it was founded more than 50 years ago 4 . When the species rank was established in the taxonomy of viruses 6 , ICTV’s responsibility for naming viruses was shifted to naming and establishing species . ICTV Study Groups may also be involved in virus naming on a case - by - case basis as an extension of their offi - cial remit , as well as using the special expertise of their members . As virus species names are often very similar to the name of the founding member of the respective species , they are frequently con - fused in the literature with names of individual viruses in this species . The species name is italicized , starts with a capital letter and should not be spelled in an abbreviated form 7 ; hence the species name Severe acute respiratory syndrome - related coronavirus . In contrast , this convention does not apply to virus names , hence severe acute respi - ratory syndrome coronavirus , or SARS - CoV , as it is widely known . Defining the place of SARS - CoV - 2 within the Coronaviridae Researchers studying coronaviruses—a family of enveloped pos - itive - strand RNA viruses infecting vertebrates 8 —have been con - fronted several times with the need to define whether a newly emerged virus causing a severe or even life - threatening disease in humans belongs to an existing or a new ( yet - to - be - established ) spe - cies . This happened with SARS 9 – 12 and with Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERS ) 13 , 14 a few years later . Each time , the virus was placed in the taxonomy using information derived from a sequence - based family classification 15 , 16 . The current classification of coronaviruses recognizes 39 species in 27 subgenera , five genera and two subfamilies that belong to the family Coronaviridae , suborder Cornidovirineae , order Nidovirales and realm Riboviria 17 – 19 ( Fig . 1 ) . The family classification and tax - onomy are developed by the Coronaviridae Study Group ( CSG ) , a working group of the ICTV 20 . The CSG is responsible for assessing Box 1 | Virus discovery and naming : from disease - based to phenotype - free Understanding the cause of a specific disease that spreads among individuals of the same host species ( infectivity ) was the major driving force for the discovery of the first virus in plants , and subsequently many others in all forms of life , including humans . Historically , the range of diseases and hosts that specific viruses are associated with have been the two key characteristics used to define viruses , given that they are invisible to the naked eye 46 . Viral phenotypic features include those that , like a disease , are pre - dominantly shaped by virus – host interactions including transmis - sion rate or immune correlates of protection , and others that are largely virus - specific , such as the architecture of virus particles . These features are of critical importance to control , and respond to medically and economically important viruses — especially during outbreaks of severe disease — and dominate the general perception of viruses . However , the host of a given virus may be uncertain , and virus pathogenicity remains unknown for a major ( and fast - growing ) proportion of viruses , including many coronaviruses discovered in metagenomics studies using next - generation sequencing technology of environmental samples 47 , 48 . These studies have identified huge numbers of viruses that circulate in nature and have never been characterized at the phenotypic level . Thus , the genome sequence is the only characteristic that is known for the vast majority of viruses , and needs to be used in defining specific viruses . In this framework , a virus is defined by a genome sequence that is capable of autonomous replication inside cells and dissemination between cells or organisms under appropriate conditions . It may or may not be harmful to its natural host . Experimental studies may be performed for a fraction of known viruses , while computational comparative genomics is used to classify ( and deduce characteristics of ) all viruses . Accordingly , virus naming is not necessarily connected to disease but rather informed by other characteristics . In view of the above advancements and when confronted with the question of whether the virus name for the newly identified human virus should be linked to the ( incompletely defined ) disease that this virus causes , or rather be established independently from the virus phenotype , the CSG decided to follow a phylogeny - based line of reasoning to name this virus whose ontogeny can be traced in the figure in Box 1 .

In the classification of nidoviruses , species are considered biological entities demar - cated by a genetics - based method 21 , while generally virus species are perceived as man - made constructs 22 . To appreciate the difference between a nidoviral species and the viruses grouped therein , it may be instructive to look at their relationship in the context of the full taxonomy structure of several coronaviruses . Although these viruses were isolated at different times and locations from different human and animal hosts ( with and without causing clinical disease ) , they all belong to the species Severe acute respiratorysyndrome - related coronavirus , and their relationship parallels that between human individuals and the species Homo sapiens ( Fig . 1 ) . Even without knowing anything about the species concept , every human recognizes another human as a member of the same species . However , for assigning individual living organisms to most other species , specialized knowledge and tools for assessing inter - individ - ual differences are required . The CSG uses a computational frame - work of comparative genomics 23 , which is shared by several ICTV Study Groups responsible for the classification and nomenclature of the order Nidovirales and coordinated by the ICTV Nidovirales Study Group ( NSG ) 24 ( Box 3 ) . The Study Groups quantify and partition the variation in the most conserved replicative proteins encoded in open reading frames 1a and 1b ( ORF1a / 1b ) of the coro - navirus genome ( Fig . 2a ) to identify thresholds on pair - wise patris - tic distances ( PPDs ) that demarcate virus clusters at different ranks . Consistent with previous reports , SARS - CoV - 2 clusters with SARS - CoVs in trees of the species Severe acute respiratory syn - drome - related coronavirus ( Fig . 2b ) and the genus Betacoronavirus ( Fig . 2c ) 25 – 27 . Distance estimates between SARS - CoV - 2 and the most closely related coronaviruses vary among different studies depend - ing on the choice of measure ( nucleotide or amino acid ) and genome region . Accordingly , there is no agreement yet on the exact taxo - nomic position of SARS - CoV - 2 within the subgenus Sarbecovirus . When we included SARS - CoV - 2 in the dataset used for the most recent update ( May 2019 ) of the coronavirus taxonomy currently being considered by ICTV 19 , which includes 2 , 505 coronaviruses , Box 2 | Identifying viral species The terms strain and isolate are commonly used to refer to virus variants , although there are different opinions as to which term should be used in a specific context . If a candidate virus clus - ters within a known group of isolates , it is a variant of this group and may be considered as belonging to this known virus group . In contrast , if the candidate virus is outside of known groups and its distances to viruses in these groups are comparable to those ob - served between viruses of different groups ( intergroup distances ) , the candidate virus is distinct and can be considered novel . This evaluation is usually conducted in silico using phylogenetic analysis , which may be complicated by uneven rates of evolution that vary across different virus lineages and genomic sites due to mutation , including the exchange of genome regions between closely related viruses ( homologous recombination ) . However , given that the current sampling of viruses is small and highly biased toward viruses of significant medical and economic interest , group composition varies tremendously among different viruses , making decisions on virus novelty group - specific and dependent on the choice of the criteria selected for this assessment . These challenges are addressed in the framework of virus taxonomy , which partitions genomic variation above strain or isolate level and develops a unique taxon nomenclature under the supervision of the ICTV 4 , 5 . To decide on whether a virus represents a new species—that is , the least diverged ( and most populated ) group of viruses—taxonomists use the results of different analyses . Taxonomical classification is hierarchical , using nested groups ( taxa ) that populate different levels ( ranks ) of classification . Taxa of different ranks differ in their intra - taxon pairwise divergence , which increases from the smallest at the species rank to the largest at the realm rank 30 . They may also be distinguished by taxon - specific markers that characterize natural groupings . Only the species and genus ranks need to be specified to classify a new virus ; filling other ranks is optional . If a virus prototypes a new species , it will be regarded as taxonomically novel . If ( within this framework ) a virus crosses a host barrier and acquires novel properties , its classification will not change ( that is , it remains part of the original species ) even if the virus establishes a permanent circulation in the new host , which likely happened with coronaviruses of the four species that circulate in humans and display seasonal peaks ( reviewed in ref . 50 ) . Importantly , the criteria used to define a viral species in one virus family such as Coronaviridae may not be applicable to another family such as Retroviridae , and vice versa , since Study Groups are independent in their approach to virus classification . Box 3 | Classifying coronaviruses Initially , the classification of coronaviruses was largely based on serological ( cross - ) reactivities to the viral spike protein , but is now based on comparative sequence analyses of replicative pro - teins . The choice of proteins and the methods used to analyse them have gradually evolved since the start of this century 20 , 28 , 29 , 51 . The CSG currently analyses 3CLpro , NiRAN , RdRp , ZBD and HEL1 ( ref . 52 ) ( Fig . 2a ) , two domains less than previously used in the analyses conducted between 2009 and 2015 ( refs . 16 , 18 ) . According to our current knowledge , these five essential do - mains are the only ones conserved in all viruses of the order Ni - dovirales 52 . They are thus used for the classification by all ICTV nidovirus study groups ( coordinated by the NSG ) . Since 2011 , the classification of coronaviruses and other nidoviruses has been assisted by the DivErsity pArtitioning by hieRarchical Clustering ( DEmARC ) software , which defines taxa and ranks 23 , 24 . Importantly , the involvement of all coronavirus genome sequences available at the time of analysis allows family - wide designations of demarcation criteria for all ranks , including species , regardless of the taxa sampling size , be it a single or hundreds of virus ( es ) . DEmARC delineates monophyletic clusters ( taxa ) of viruses using weighted linkage clustering in the PPD space and according to the classification of ranks defined through clustering cost ( CC ) minima presented as PPD thresholds ( PPD accounts for multiple substitutions at all sequence positions and thus may exceed 1 . 0 , which is the limit for conventional pair - wise distances ( PDs ) ) . In the DEmARC framework , the persistence of thresholds in the face of increasing virus sampling is interpreted to reflect biological forces and environmental factors 21 . Homologous recombination , which is common in coronaviruses 53 – 55 , is believed to be restricted in genome regions encoding the most essential proteins , such as those used for classification , and to members of the same virus species . This restriction promotes intra - species diversity and contributes to inter - species separation . To facilitate the use of rank thresholds outside of the DEmARC framework , they are converted into PD and expressed as a percentage , which researchers commonly use to arrive at a tentative assignment of a given virus within the coronavirus taxonomy following conventional phylogenetic analysis of selected viruses . NATuRe MICRobIoloGy | VOL 5 | MArch 2020 | 536 – 544 | www . nature . com / naturemicrobiology 538 Consensus statement NATuRe MICROBIOlOGy the species composition was not affected and the virus was assigned to the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome - related coronavirus , as detailed in Box 4 . With respect to novelty , SARS - CoV - 2 differs from the two other zoonotic coronaviruses , SARS - CoV and MERS - CoV , introduced to humans earlier in the twenty - first century . Previously , the CSG established that each of these two viruses prototype a new species in a new informal subgroup of the genus Betacoronavirus 15 , 16 . These two informal subgroups were recently recognized as subgenera Sarbecovirus and Merbecovirus 18 , 28 , 29 when the subgenus rank was established in the virus taxonomy 30 . Being the first identified repre - sentatives of a new species , unique names were introduced for the two viruses and their taxa in line with the common practice and state of virus taxonomy at the respective times of isolation . The situation with SARS - CoV - 2 is fundamentally different because this virus is assigned to an existing species that contains hundreds of known viruses predominantly isolated from humans and diverse bats . All these viruses have names derived from SARS - CoV , although only the human isolates collected during the 2002 – 2003 outbreak have been confirmed to cause SARS in infected individuals . Thus , the reference to SARS in all these virus names ( combined with the use of specific prefixes , suffixes and / or genome sequence IDs in pub - lic databases ) acknowledges the phylogenetic ( rather than clinical disease - based ) grouping of the respective virus with the prototypic virus in that species ( SARS - CoV ) . The CSG chose the name SARS - CoV - 2 based on the established practice for naming viruses in this species and the relatively distant relationship of this virus to the pro - totype SARS - CoV in a species tree and the distance space ( Fig . 2b and the figure in Box 4 ) . The available yet limited epidemiological and clinical data for SARS - CoV - 2 suggest that the disease spectrum and transmission efficiency of this virus 31 – 35 differ from those reported for SARS - CoV 9 . To accommodate the wide spectrum of clinical presentations and outcomes of infections caused by SARS - CoV - 2 ( ranging from asymptomatic to severe or even fatal in some cases ) 31 , the WHO recently introduced a rather unspecific name ( coronavirus disease 19 , also known as COVID - 19 ( ref . 36 ) ) to denote this disease . Also , the diagnostic methods used to confirm SARS - CoV - 2 infections are not identical to those of SARS - CoV . This is reflected by the specific recommendations for public health practitioners , healthcare work - ers and laboratory diagnostic staff for SARS - CoV - 2 ( for example , the WHO guidelines for SARS - CoV - 2 ( ref . 37 ) . By uncoupling the naming conventions used for coronaviruses and the diseases that some of them cause in humans and animals , we wish to support the WHO in its efforts to establish disease names in the most appro - priate way ( for further information , see the WHO’s guidelines for disease naming 38 ) . The further advancement of naming conventions is also important because the ongoing discovery of new human and animal viruses by next - generation sequencing technologies can be expected to produce an increasing number of viruses that do not ( easily ) fit the virus – disease model that was widely used in the pre - genomic era ( Box 1 ) . Having now established different names for the causative virus ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) and the disease ( COVID - 19 ) , the CSG hopes that this will raise awareness in both the general public and public health authorities regarding the difference between these two entities . The CSG promotes this clear distinction because it will help improve the outbreak management and also reduces the risk of confusing virus and disease , as has been the case over many years with SARS - CoV ( the virus ) and SARS ( the disease ) . To facilitate good practice and scientific exchange , the CSG rec - ommends that researchers describing new viruses ( that is , isolates ) in this species adopt a standardized format for public databases and publications that closely resembles the formats used for isolates of avian coronaviruses 39 , filoviruses 40 and influenza virus 1 . The pro - posed naming convention includes a reference to the host organism that the virus was isolated from , the place of isolation ( geographic location ) , an isolate or strain number , and the time of isolation ( year or more detailed ) in the format virus / host / location / isolate / date ; for Sarbecovirus Nidovirales Primates Homo sapiens Coronaviruses Category Humans Order Family Subfamily Subgenus Genus Species Individuum Suborder Realm Coronaviridae Orthocoronavirinae Betacoronavirus Riboviria Cornidovirineae Hominidae Homininae Homo Divergence Dmitri Ivanovsky , Martinus Beijerinck , Friedrich Loeffler , Barbara McClintock , Marie Curie , Albert Einstein , Rosalind Franklin , Hideki Yukawa , and so on .

Although no equivalence is implied , the species of coronaviruses is interpreted sensu stricto as accepted for the species of humans .

Due to their minute share of ~ 10 – 4 of the to - tal number of all intra - and inter - species PPDs , these violators may not even be visually recognized in a conventional diagonal plot clus - tering viruses on a species basis ( panel a of the figure in Box 4 ) . Furthermore , they do not involve any virus of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome - related coronavirus , as is evident from the analysis of maximal intraspecies PPDs of 2 , 505 viruses of all 49 coronavirus species ( of which 39 are established and 10 are pending or tentative ) ( panel b of the figure in Box 4 ) and PDs of 256 viruses of this species ( panel c of the figure in Box 4 ) . Thus , the genomic variation of the known viruses of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome - related coronavirus is smaller compared to that of other comparably well - sampled species—for example , those prototyped by MERS - CoV , human coronavirus OC43 ( HCoV - OC43 ) and in - fectious bronchitis virus ( IBV ) ( panel b of the figure in Box 4 ) —and this species is well separated from other known coronavirus species in the sequence space . Both of these characteristics facilitate the un - ambiguous assignment of SARS - CoV - 2 to this species . Intra - species PDs of SARS - CoV - 2 belong to the top 25 % of this species and also include the largest PD between SARS - CoV - 2 and an African bat virus isolate ( SARSr - CoV _ BtKY72 ) 56 ( panel c of the figure in Box 4 ) , representing two basal lineages within the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome - related coronavirus that constitute very few known viruses ( Fig . 2b , c ) . These relationships stand in contrast to the shallow branching of the most populous lineage of this species , which includes all the human SARS - CoV isolates collected during the 2002 – 2003 outbreak and the closely related bat viruses of Asian origin identified in the search for the potential zoonotic source of that epidemic 57 . This clade structure is susceptible to homologous recombination , which is common in this species 44 , 58 , 59 ; to formalize clade definition , it must be revisited after the sampling of viruses representing the deep branches has improved sufficiently . The current sampling defines a very small median PD for human SARS - CoVs , which is approximately 15 times smaller than the median PD determined for SARS - CoV - 2 ( 0 . 16 % versus 2 . 6 % ; panel c of the figure in Box 4 ) . This small median PD of human SARS - CoVs also dominates the species - wide PD distribution ( 0 . 25 % ; panel c of the figure in Box 4 ) .

This complete designation along with additional and important characteristics , such as pathogenic potential in humans or other hosts , should be included in the submission of each isolate genome sequence to pub - lic databases such as GenBank . In publications , this name could be further extended with a sequence database ID—for example , SARS - CoV - 2 / human / Wuhan / X1 / 2019 _ XYZ12345 ( fictional exam - ple ) —when first mentioned in the text . We believe that this format will provide critical metadata on the major characteristics of each particular virus isolate ( genome sequence ) required for subsequent epidemiological and other studies , as well as for control measures . expanding the focus from pathogens to virus species Historically , public health and fundamental research have been focused on the detection , containment , treatment and analysis of viruses that are pathogenic to humans following their discovery ( a reactive approach ) . Exploring and defining their biological char - acteristics in the context of the entire natural diversity as a spe - cies has never been a priority . The emergence of SARS - CoV - 2 as a human pathogen in December 2019 may thus be perceived as com - pletely independent from the SARS - CoV outbreak in 2002 – 2003 . Although SARS - CoV - 2 is indeed not a descendent of SARS - CoV ( Fig . 2b ) , and the introduction of each of these viruses into humans was likely facilitated by independent unknown external factors , the two viruses are genetically so close to each other ( Fig . 2c , panel c of the figure in Box 4 ) that their evolutionary histories and character - istics are mutually informative . The currently known viruses of the species Severe acute respi - ratory syndrome - related coronavirus may be as ( poorly ) repre - sentative for this particular species as the few individuals that we selected to represent H . sapiens in Fig . 1 . It is thus reasonable to assume that this biased knowledge of the natural diversity of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome - related coronavirus limits our current understanding of fundamental aspects of the biology of this species and , as a consequence , our abilities to control zoo - notic spillovers to humans . Future studies aimed at understanding the ecology of these viruses and advancing the accuracy and reso - lution of evolutionary analyses 41 would benefit greatly from adjust - ing our research and sampling strategies . This needs to include an expansion of our current research focus on human pathogens and their adaptation to specific hosts to other viruses in this species . To illustrate the great potential of species - wide studies , it may again be instructive to draw a parallel to H . sapiens , and specifi - cally to the impressive advancements in personalized medicine in recent years . Results of extensive genetic analyses of large num - bers of individuals representing diverse populations from all con - tinents have been translated into clinical applications and greatly contribute to optimizing patient - specific diagnostics and therapy . They were instrumental in identifying reliable predictive markers for specific diseases as well as genomic sites that are under selec - tion . It thus seems reasonable to expect that genome - based analy - ses with a comparable species coverage will be similarly insightful for coronaviruses . Also , additional diagnostic tools that target the entire species should be developed to complement existing tools optimized to detect individual pathogenic variants ( a proactive approach ) . Technical solutions to this problem are already avail - able ; for example , in the context of multiplex PCR - based assays 42 . The costs for developing and applying ( combined or separate ) spe - cies - and virus - specific diagnostic tests in specific clinical and / or epidemiological settings may help to better appreciate the biologi - cal diversity and zoonotic potential of specific virus species and their members . Also , the further reduction of time required to identify the causative agents of novel virus infections will contrib - ute to limiting the enormous social and economic consequences of large outbreaks . To advance such studies , innovative fundraising approaches may be required . Although this Consensus Statement focuses on a single virus species , the issues raised apply to other species in the family and possibly beyond . A first step towards appreciation of this species and others would be for researchers , journals , databases and other relevant bodies to adopt proper referencing to the full taxonomy of coronaviruses under study , including explicit mentioning of the relevant virus species and the specific virus ( es ) within the species using the ICTV naming rules explained above . This naming con - vention is , regretfully , rarely observed in common practice , with mixing of virus and species names being frequently found in the literature ( including by the authors of this Consensus Statement on several past occasions ) . The adoption of accurate virus - naming practices should be facilitated by the major revision of the virus spe - cies nomenclature that is currently being discussed by the ICTV and is being planned for implementation in the near future 43 . With this change in place , the CSG is resolved to address the existing sig - nificant overlap between virus and species names that complicates the appreciation and use of the species concept in its application to coronaviruses .
