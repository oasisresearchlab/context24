Scientific Editor : Antônio Domingos Padula THE STATE OF RESEARCH ON CLEANER PRODUCTION IN BRAZIL O estado da pesquisa sobre produção mais limpa no Brasil El estado de la investigación sobre producción más limpia en Brasil ABSTRACT The application of cleaner production ( CP ) practices in companies is not commonplace in Brazil . Moreover , there are significant difficulties in establishing partnerships among universities , com - panies , and the government . However , an increase in the number of companies concerned about the impacts of industrial activities on the environment has enabled the development of CP research . Hence , using a literature review and a bibliometric analysis to quantify the scientific production of CP , published in a congress promoted by the Journal of Cleaner Production in Brazil , and an analysis of social networks using UCINET - Draw , this study contributes to the current state of CP research in Brazil . Despite remarkable developments , shareholders and entrepreneurs still lack knowledge about the subsidies / funds to implement CP made available by the government , which would improve the imple - mentation of CP practices . Moreover , university research programs may help companies to generate innovations in this field . This study is one of the first to review CP practices in Brazil , and proposes a framework to promote CP practices in Brazil .

RESUMO A aplicação da produção mais limpa ( PML ) em empresas não é prática comum no Brasil . Além disso , há dificuldades significativas para o estabelecimento de parcerias entre universidades , empresas e o governo . Entretanto , um aumento no número de empresas preocupadas com os impactos das atividades industriais no meio - ambiente tem permitido o desenvolvimento de pesquisas sobre PML . Assim , utilizando uma revisão de literatura e uma análise bibliométrica para quantificar a produção científica sobre PML , publicadas em um congresso promovido pelo Journal of Cleaner Production no Brasil , e uma análise de redes sociais , com a utilização do UCINET - Draw , este estudo contribui para o estado atual da pesquisa sobre PML no Brasil . Apesar de notáveis avanços , ainda falta aos acionis - tas e empreendedores conhecimento sobre os subsídios / fundos disponibilizados pelo governo para a implementação da PML , os quais melhorariam a implementação de práticas de PML . Além disso , programas de pesquisa universitária podem ajudar as empresas a gerar inovações neste campo .

Moreover , in order to minimize the impacts on the environment , many companies have changed their production processes , which has made research on cleaner production ( CP ) possible . According to The United Nations Environment Programme , CP is defined as the continuous application of an integrated preventative environmental strategy to processes , products , and services to increase efficiency and reduce risks to humans and the environment ( UNIDO , 2015 ) . This concept emerged in response to the need to disseminate information on sustainable development to enterprises , government agencies , and the academic community so that the impact of industrial activities on ecosystems could be understood and minimized . This understanding aids the identification and resolution of the problem of wasted raw materials in manufacturing processes . CP must be included in manufacturing processes in order to reduce emissions and to promote the use of resources in an eco - efficient manner ( Glavič & Lukman , 2007 ) . CP was initially introduced in Brazil in 1995 through the creation of the National Center for Clean Technologies ( CNTL ) . The Brazilian Network subsequently supported the Center in order for CP work centers to be installed in all Brazilian states ( Pereira & Sant’Anna , 2012 ) . CP analyzes aspects related to the operation of a business and identifies opportunities for improvement , in terms of both economic and environmental performance ( Khan , 2008 ) . Works that use bibliometric , meta - analyses , content analyses , and systematic reviews related to CP stakeholders include methanol production , sustainable development , similarities and differences in the concept of CP , carbon dioxide reuse in the production of leather , and barriers and CP strategies . Staniskis ( 2012 ) conducted analysis in different cases of researches carried out in Austria , Bulgaria , Estonia , Lithuania and Spain , denoting that the best results can be achieved when all stakeholders work together to implement sustainable production and consumption . However , seeking stakeholder’s cooperation in environmental and economic practices is a challenge . Riaz , Zahedi , and Klemes ( 2013 ) reviewed how CP is used in the methanol production process . The main purpose was to highlight the problems associated with the production of methanol , as well as to comply with the efforts of scientists and researchers to overcome these problems using modeling and optimization . Furthermore , they discussed the environmental benefits of methanol in reducing carbon dioxide ( CO 2 ) . Their findings indicate that methanol can increase consumption when mixed with fuel gas . Fluidized bed reactors , membrane reactors , and thermally coupled reactors are more viable , and have the potential to contribute to CP . Karatzoglou ( 2013 ) compiled a literature review of education for sustainable development from articles published between 2003 and 2011 . The results showed that CP is an excellent strategy for sustainable development . The most relevant journals were the Journal of Sustainability in Higher Education and the Journal of Cleaner Production , which included case studies . Sangwan and Mittal ( 2015 ) reviewed green manufacturing and similar structures in order to trace the origin , definitions , scope , similarities , and differences of green manufacturing ; environmentally conscious manufacturing ; environmentally responsible manufacturing ; environmentally benign manufacturing ; sustainable manufacturing ; clean manufacturing ; cleaner production ; and sustainable production with reference to the triple bottom line , product life cycle engineering , the systems approach , resource and energy efficiency , supply chains , and pollution prevention . Their results showed the need for standardization , because the aforementioned terms are not used consistently as concepts . In general , these terms focus on the life cycle , formulating end - of - life strategies , including the overall supply chain , and integrating environmental improvement strategies with business strategies . Deng , Chen , Huang , Hu , and Chen ( 2015 ) reviewed carbon dioxide deliming in leather production , and proposed reusing carbon dioxide by means of available absorption and desorption technologies , which reduces occupational safety risks , regenerates new resources , and leads to CP . Moreover , they give an overview of the fundamentals , process optimization , occupational safety , and possible ways forward for carbon dioxide deliming in leather , and provide useful information to researchers and engineers in this field . Then , Hu and Deng ( 2016 ) conducted a literature review on the application of supercritical carbon dioxide in leather processing , and found opportunities to use carbon dioxide as a potential alternative solution for the CP of leather . Vieira and Amaral ( 2016 ) conducted a survey to identify why CP is not widely adopted based on a systematic review of 37 articles distributed between 1994 and 2014 . Their findings showed that regulations need to be more than simply a legal requirement , and must be seen as an opportunity for improvement . In addition , they identified characteristics that must be emphasized in methodologies and tools that can help in the execution of CP programs . These characteristics are related to culture , policies , methodologies adopted , education , and a lack of social pressure . It is necessary to promote the dissemination of knowledge and 549 ISSN 0034 - 7590 AUTHORS | Geraldo Cardoso Oliveira Neto | Fábio Ytoshi Shibao | Moacir Godinho Filho © RAE | São Paulo | V . 56 | n . 5 | set - out 2016 | 547 - 577 commitment within the entire chain of businesses , academics , governments , and the community . Chang , Wu , Qiao , and Zhang ( 2015 ) used a spatial and temporal analysis to show the geographical characteristics , regional differences , time variations , and industry allocations of CP development in China . In addition , they emphasized the implementation of CP in various industries to further demonstrate the regional characteristics of CP development in China . Finally , they proposed suggestions to promote the use of CP management systems for future CP development in China . The above findings indicate many deficiencies and gaps . With regard to the gaps , possible actions and measures include the following . First , to perfect the institutional system , it is necessary to institute supporting and supplemental regulations and policies in order to enhance the pertinence , compulsion , and enforceability of laws and provisions and to increase the applicability of CP to industries . In addition , it is highly recommended that CP be integrated with environmental management . Second , to improve administrative management , it is necessary to refine the scope of work for government agencies and to establish collaborative procedures and coordinating mechanisms between government departments , such as the environmental protection bureau , the competent authority of the industrial sector , and funding management agencies . Third , to expand China’s funding sources , it is necessary to institute policies that encourage the use of CP , including emission reduction incentives , CP subsidies , tax exemptions and reductions , and bank financing . Fourth , it is necessary to improve the technical capacity , including regular training sessions , annual performance evaluations , and the development of a professional qualification certificate system . It is also necessary to regularly compile and publish reports on CP case analyses in order to facilitate the dissemination of knowledge and technologies . Fifth , to enhance system acceptance , it is important to develop personnel so that they may qualify as experts . Moreover , it is crucial to constantly promulgate updated technical guidelines for industrial sectors in order to direct CP implementations . Sixth , to increase the number of research projects , it is necessary to increase the funding for such projects , including regulations , policies , institutions , methodologies , and technical guidelines . Furthermore , public participation needs to be promoted to develop a platform of information disclosure to broadcast new laws , regulations , and provisions in a timely manner , as well as to share experiences . Therefore , although CP development in China is generally increasing , there are clear geographically significant differences across regions , with considerable disparity in industrial allocation , especially for key enterprises , owing to government initiatives . Thus , it would beneficial to CP development in China if regionalized CP management systems were established and operated based on key geographical features , regional differences , and allocations among the various industries . We were not able to find any literature that promotes improvements in the state of CP research in Brazil . Our results enable us to discuss the current state of such research in Brazil , and to suggest ways in which it can be improved and to present the possible consequences of making such changes . Therefore , this study serves as a guide for future Brazilian research on this topic . The Journal of Cleaner Production ( JCP ) has published many articles on CP ( Karatzoglou , 2013 ) . Moreover , it promotes and assists various workshops around the world to develop CP research . Another relevant aspect is that , every two years , the journal conducts the International Workshop on Advances in Cleaner Production ( IWACP ) , in which the JCP chief editor launches a special volume to boost national and international submissions for the journal . Thus , the research question addressed in the present research is as follows : How do we improve the state of CP research in Brazil ? Based on this question , this research aims to achieve the following objectives : • To identify the main thematic research on CP in Brazil • To identify the most used research methods when investigating CP in Brazil • To identify which business segments have adopted CP in Brazil • To understand the relationship among universities , the government , and enterprises in terms of CP research in Brazil . This article is organized as follows . Next sections present the research procedures , our results and analysis , and the discussion of the results . Last section concludes the article . Research procedures The research procedure consists of a bibliometric analysis to quantify the scientific production ( Cooper & Lindsay , 1998 ) . According to Pilkington and Meredith ( 2009 ) and Hassan , Haddawy , and Zhu ( 2013 ) , a bibliometric analysis is relevant to indicating directions and strategies for future studies . 550 ISSN 0034 - 7590 ARTICLES | The state of research on cleaner production in Brazil © RAE | São Paulo | V . 56 | n . 5 | set - out 2016 | 547 - 577 Data collection First , we perform a literature review of bibliometric studies and bibliometric reviews on the research topic of the present study . In this phase , “ProQuest , ” “EBSCO , ” “JSTOR , ” and “Google Scholar” were researched for the period April 2013 to July 2013 . The researched articles included the following keywords ( in the title , keywords , or abstract ) : “bibliometric” and “cleaner production , ” “bibliometric” and “environmental , ” “bibliometric” and “sustainable production” and “bibliometric” and “sustainable manufacturing . ” Based on this search , we identified 42 articles from which the constructs of the present study could be proposed , as follows : the main thematics ; business segments studied ; research methods employed ; and author affiliations , which can be specified as university , government , enterprise , or country . Next , 512 articles published on the proceedings of the JCP congress of 2007 , 2009 , 2011 , and 2013 were identified . A systematic analysis of the content of these papers was performed to identify their research constructs and to codify the data in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet . The content analysis performed in this study is a source document that represents the content of these documents for the inference of knowledge through a set of operations ( codification , categorization ) ( Bardin , 1986 ) . The document analysis of the 512 articles lasted approximately 10 months , after which the data were codified and extracted from the articles and categorized based on the constructs . Data collection was performed and conferred upon by three researchers in an independent manner to minimize errors and prejudice ( Hayes & Krippendorff , 2007 ) . Building the basis of our constructs : Bibliometric stu - dies found in literature For this study , we identified 42 articles that performed bibliometric studies in the environmental area . The main goal of this review was to select the basis for the constructs of the present study . The variables were chosen because they were found in the 42 articles related to bibliometric CP studies . Of the 42 papers , 20 are based on thematics , in which publications are evaluated based on the primary subject of the articles . According to Leonidou and Leonidou ( 2011 ) , the analysis of thematics seeks to identify the primary subjects , making it possible to suggest directions for future studies and to assess the knowledge of a specific thematic ( Barrios , Borrego , Vilaginés , Ollé , & Somoza , 2008 ) . The subjects studied by the authors included the following : technology , knowledge , science , and evolution and policy ( Radosevic , 2008 ) ; competitive advantage and sustainable supply chains ( Brito & Berardi , 2010 ) ; green supply chains ( Brito & Berardi , 2010 ; Jung , 2011 ; Rocha , Rocha , Rosa , Camargo , Zamberlan , & Gomes , 2013 ) ; sustainability ( Avila , Madruga , Zamberlan , & Barros , 2013 ; Rocha et al . , 2013 ) ; environmental management ( Leonidou & Leonidou , 2011 ) ; sustainable innovation ( Kneipp , Rosa , Bichueti , Madruga , & Schuch , 2011 ) ; design processes and design cognition ( Chai & Xiao , 2012 ) ; environmental disclosure and environmental accounting ( Rosa , Ensslin , Ensslin , & Lunkes , 2012a ) ; and water ( Avila et al . , 2013 ) . An analysis of universities identified the teaching institutions affiliated with the authors published in the events , congresses , and conferences , as well as their relationships . According to Du , Wei , Brown , Wang , and Shi , ( 2013 ) , an analysis of universities identifies the teaching institutions that produced the most articles per country on a specific thematic . Yarime , Takeda , and Kajikawa ( 2010 ) comment that various attempts have been initiated to create global systems of research collaboration among universities in order to improve the quality of studies . The country analysis seeks to identify the origins of the universities affiliated with the published authors . According to Machado , Manfrin , Lima , Silva , and Maciel ( 2012 ) , a country analysis consists of identifying the geographic locations of the universities through the author affiliations . Yarime et al . ( 2010 ) note that an analysis of countries includes international collaborations within a specific thematic , which can be effective for sharing existing regional knowledge . In general , the works studied from this perspective , associated universities with analyses by country . The results showed that an article addressing the thematic of eco - design analyzed 2 , 978 publications , and that the Delft University of Technology was the most prolific , with 85 publications ( Boks , Stevels , & Koster , 2001 ) . A study on sustainable development identified 304 different universities in 53 countries , with an emphasis on 16 universities : 12 located in the United States , 2 in Canada , 1 in England , and 1 in Australia ( Wright & Pullen , 2007 ) . Another study on research technology , knowledge , science , and evolution and policy identified the degree of concentration of these articles as 35 % in universities in the United States , and 20 % in universities in developing countries ( Radosevic , 2008 ) . When addressing sustainability , US universities published 27 % , and UK universities published 11 % ( Yarime et al . , 2010 ) . In analyzing the assessment of the environmental impact , it was observed that there was a significant increase in the number of publications , from five articles in 1973 to 250 in 2009 ( Yanhua , Song , Hongyan , & Beibei , 2011 ) . With regard to sustainable innovation , the United States published the most articles ( 236 ) , and Sweden published the least ( 33 ) . From this , we inferred that the institutions that published the most are found in 551 ISSN 0034 - 7590 AUTHORS | Geraldo Cardoso Oliveira Neto | Fábio Ytoshi Shibao | Moacir Godinho Filho © RAE | São Paulo | V . 56 | n . 5 | set - out 2016 | 547 - 577 countries that invest in research ( Kneipp et al . , 2011 ) . With regard to sustainability , renewable energy , and the environment , it was observed that 40 universities produced more than 50 articles , with The Technical University of Denmark being the most productive ( Romo - Fernández , Guerrero - Bote , & Moya - Anegón , 2012 ) . The article identified the United States ( 30 % ) and the UK ( 20 % ) as the countries that published the most , and Asia ( 10 % ) and Oceania ( 10 % ) as the regions that published the least ( Chai & Xiao , 2012 ) . With regard to environmental disclosure , it was observed that the University of the Witwatersrand ( 47 ) published the most , and the University of Western Ontario ( 14 ) published the least , while the United States ( 560 ) published the most and Iran ( 29 ) published the least ( Rosa et al . , 2012a ) . A study on performance measurement identified that the United States ( 66 ) published the most articles , and Italy ( 8 ) published the least ( Taticchi , Tonelli , & Pasqualino , 2013 ) . With regard to green supply chain management , the University Kassel ( 9 ) published the most articles , and Dalian University Technology ( 4 ) published the least . Then , the country with the most publications was the United States ( 81 ) , while Brazil ( 7 ) had the fewest publications ( Rocha et al . , 2013 ) . With regard to water , it was found that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization ( CSIRO ) ( 154 ) was the university with the most publications , while Cornell University ( 34 ) was 25 in the list . Here , the United States ( 1 , 234 ) published the most articles , followed by Australia ( 532 ) ( Avila et al . , 2013 ) . Finally , with regard to energy efficiency , the University of California , Berkeley , USA ( 142 ) , published the most articles , while Oak Ridge National Lab , USA ( 32 ) , published the least . Of the universities that published the most articles , two were American , six were Asian , one was European and one was Brazilian . Furthermore , the United States ( 1 , 799 ) published the most articles , and Italy ( 201 ) published the least ( Du et al . , 2013 ) . In the studied works , seven bibliometric studies that analyzed the research methods used in the publications were identified . The analysis of the publication methods enables us to rank the methodological procedures used and to conduct a relational analysis . According to Leonidou and Leonidou ( 2011 ) , the method of analysis consists of evaluating whether the studies showed greater consistency in their results . The articles were on the thematics of environmental management ( Leonidou & Leonidou , 2011 ) , life cycle analyses ( Costa & Boente , 2012 ) , and sustainability operation management ( Machado et al . , 2012 ) . For the thematics , a greater use of exploratory research and a low incidence of literature reviews were found . With regard to the thematics of corporate social responsibility ( Bakker , Groenewegen , & Hond , 2005 ) and environmental accounting ( Rosa et al . , 2012b ) , the most common method was the literature review , while descriptive studies were least common . For the thematic of ecological economics , a trend toward empirical methods ( 42 % ) was noted ( Silva & Teixeira , 2011 ) . For the thematic of responsible procurement , quantitative research was the most used method ( 35 . 10 % ) , and descriptive studies were the least used ( 4 . 8 % ) ( Hoejmose & Adrien - Kirby , 2012 ) . Of the researched studies , five bibliometric studies analyzed government agencies . A bibliometric analysis of government agencies seeks to identify participation and the relationships in articles published by entities of the government in congresses , conferences , and so on . The analysis of government agencies in bibliometric studies permits the identification of government participation in sustainability practices ( Romo - Fernández et al . , 2012 ) . The articles showed that government agencies published more than universities when studies published in the primary congresses were considered ( Boks et al . , 2001 ) . With regard to technology , knowledge , science , and evolution and policy , the results of government policies were limited when there were no organizers in the university , enterprise , and government relationships ( Radosevic , 2008 ) . For sustainability , renewable energy , and the environment , 22 % articles were published by government agencies ( Romo - Fernández et al . , 2012 ) . Four bibliometric studies on business constructs were identified . Bibliometric analyses that focus on business seek to identify the participation of companies in research and their relationships in articles published in congresses , conferences , and so on . According to Boks et al . ( 2001 ) , the participation of enterprises in scientific articles in the environmental area consists of evaluating whether the enterprises are promoting and allowing research on sustainability practices in production . The articles mention eco - design , which refers to enterprises that produce their own publications ( 6 % ) ( Boks et al . , 2001 ) . With regard to technology , knowledge , science , and evolution and policy , this method identified that innovation is successful when enterprises participate in research ( Radosevic , 2008 ) . With regard to the green supply chain , the regulatory pressure of the market is the predominant focus in the relationship between the enterprise and stakeholders ( 41 % ) , followed by the objectives of improving the economic and environmental performance ( 30 % ) ( Brito & Berardi , 2010 ) . Only one study that performed a bibliometric study of business segments of enterprises was identified . According to Rocha et al . ( 2012b ) , analyses of the business segments of enterprises consists of understanding which business segments participated in studies in published articles , for example , when sustainability is studied in the mining industry segment .

This method enabled the identification of thematics , business segments , and research methods in the articles . Next , the authors’ affiliations were identified . In addition , to identify the number of occurrences for each of these constructs , the networks were analyzed to establish the relationships among the constructs . According to Pareto principles , 80 % of the total is dependent on 20 % of the whole , which is formally known as the 80 / 20 rule . Thus , this rule was used for Brazilian universities . A social network analysis examines the patterns of ties in a network of nodes and ties . In a social network , the nodes can be persons or firms that have activities in that both have the ability to make choices . Network metrics can be calculated at the node level and at the network level . Node - level metrics measure how an individual node is embedded in a network from that individual node’s perspective . Network level metrics compute how the overall network ties are organized ( Kim , Choi , Yan , & Dooley , 2011 ) . In this analysis , the primary thematic ( see Table 1 ) and Brazilian universities ( see Table 3 ) were identified ( Graph 1 ) to facilitate the analysis of social networks using UCINET - Draw in order to generate indicators and to substantiate graphics ( Borgatti , 2002 ) . However , when analyzing foreign universities , governments , and enterprises , 100 % of cases were considered ( see Table 3 ) . Next , the CP thematic was analyzed ( 219 articles ) , culminating in a single network showing the relationship among research methods and business segments . The main subjects of the papers were taken from the Principles of CP . Then , the networks were analyzed in order to establish the relationships among the most and least business segments investigated , the research methods , and subjects ( see Table 2 ) . The networks of Brazilian and foreign universities , governments , and enterprises were analyzed based on 512 articles in two groups . The first group was composed of the following two steps , in which the total affiliations of authors of Brazilian universities were analyzed : ( i ) The number of internal relationships ( relationships among themselves ) and the number of external relationships ( publications with other universities , governments , and enterprises ) are identified . For example , if an article has three authors , we analyzed whether they are affiliated with the same university ( internal relationships ; IR ) or other universities , governments , and enterprises ( external relationships ; ER ) . Next , the data were recorded in the first column of Table 3 . ( ii ) Then , 32 universities from 15 relations were analyzed in detail to identify the most relevant relationships , allowing us to generate propositions about the research findings . The most important relationships were then recorded in the second column of Table 3 . Note that in this network , repeated affiliations in the same article were excluded . In other words , we considered just one per item in order to evaluate the number of times each university , government , and enterprise appeared in a relationship . The second group was composed of two steps , which analyzed the total affiliations of the authors in foreign universities , governments , and enterprises , considering all foreign affiliations , regardless of whether they had relationships with Brazilian entities : ( i ) Overall , we measured the quantity of internal relationships ( relationships among themselves ) and the number of external relationships ( publications performed with other universities , governments , and enterprises ) , as shown in the third column of Table 3 . ( ii ) The most relevant relationships ( companies from four external relations , universities from three external relations , and all government affiliations ) allowed us to generate propositions about the research findings , in addition to identifying the most important relationships . The results are shown in the fourth column of Table 3 . This step repeated the procedure performed in step two of the first group . In this study , the density was extracted from external relationships only . If a specific node or actor did not have an external relationship , then their density in the network is set to zero ( Hanneman & Riddle , 2005 ) . Then , we selected the strongest ties ( cohesion ) in each of the constructs studied . Here , we extracted the data from the most relevant relations among these constructs in order to create Table 3 . According to De Nooy , Mrvar , and Batagelj ( 2005 ) , analyzing the cohesion of a network enables the identification of the strongest ties , which represent the most important nodes of the relationships . The bibliometric indicators of the social network analysis were as follows : ( i ) the degree of centrality ( DC ) , which evaluates the number of ties that one element has in relation to others in 558 ISSN 0034 - 7590 ARTICLES | The state of research on cleaner production in Brazil © RAE | São Paulo | V . 56 | n . 5 | set - out 2016 | 547 - 577 the network ( Wasserman & Faust , 1994 ) ; if one element shows a larger number of connections , it is more centralized ( Scott , 2000 ) ; ( ii ) the cohesion , which identifies the strongest ties relative to the researched universe ( De Nooy et al . , 2005 ) ; and ( iii ) the density , which evaluates the average force of all possible ties ( Hanneman & Riddle , 2005 ) . According to Watts and Strogatz ( 1998 ) , density is a measure of the intensity of interactions among network actors . Its measurement contributes to the formation of propositions about information that circulates through the network , which means it can be calculated For the network as a whole and for each of the programs . RESULTS AND ANALYSIS In this section , the thematics , research methods , and business segments of the JCP congress and their relationships are evaluated using social network indicators . Graph 1 shows the main thematics of all articles published in 2007 , 2009 , 2011 , and 2013 . The data indicate that the six most used thematics are cleaner production ( 219 publications ) , environmental management ( 76 ) , sustainable development ( 47 ) , energy ( 31 ) , environmental education ( 29 ) , and waste management ( 27 ) .

The metal mechanics segment was the most studied business segment in the CP thematic . Agribusiness is the most studied segment in the sustainable development and energy thematic . The building sector is also widely studied in the energy thematic . With regard to environmental management , deals with more than one segment ( several business segments ) are more frequent than any other individual segment . The education segment is the most studied segment within environmental education , and landfills and agribusiness are the most frequent segments in waste management . From Table 1 , we can also see that case studies are the most used research method in the following thematics : CP , sustainable development , and environmental education . Case studies are also used frequently in the other three thematics , but other research methods are employed more often . Theoretical descriptive research is the most used research method for thematic environmental management and energy . Laboratory research is the most used research method for waste management . Other research methods , such as surveys , multiple cases , bibliometric research , and action research were rarely found in these six main thematics . The average force of the ties indicates that in 2011 the CP thematic measured a larger density than it did in the other years ( 0 . 3516 ) and had a greater number of ties ( 64 ) . 559 ISSN 0034 - 7590 AUTHORS | Geraldo Cardoso Oliveira Neto | Fábio Ytoshi Shibao | Moacir Godinho Filho © RAE | São Paulo | V . 56 | n . 5 | set - out 2016 | 547 - 577 Table 1 .

From Table 1 , specifically for CP thematics , we developed a single network showing the relationships among research methods and business segments . Graph . 2 shows that the case study method was the most used research method , demonstrating greater cohesion ( 100 ties ) , which represents the strongest ties in relation to the other research methods . Laboratory research and theoretical descriptive research are also common . Other research methods , such as multiple cases , surveys , action research , and bibliometrics , are scarce . Graph 2 . Relationships among business segments and research methods for CP thematics . Table 2 ( and Graph 3 and 4 , respectively ) show the most studied and least studied business segments , the relationship among research methods , and the main subjects addressed in the papers . These main subjects were taken from the Principles of CP ( Glavič & Lukman , 2007 ; Giannetti , Ogura , Bonilla , & Almeida , 2012 ; García , Pongrácza , Phillips , & Keiski , 2013 ) : ( 1 ) the reduction and non - generation of emissions and resources ; ( 2 ) economic and environmental benefits ; ( 3 ) efficiency of the use of raw materials ; ( 4 ) efficiency of the use of water ; ( 5 ) efficiency of the use of energy ; ( 6 ) recycling / reuse of wastes and emissions ; and ( 7 ) occupational health benefits .

This was followed by the reduction and non - generation of emissions and resources ( RNGER ; 13 ties ) in the sanitation segment ( 7 ) using laboratory research . Then , the subject efficiency of the use of raw materials ( EURM ; 1 tie ) and occupational health benefits ( OHB ; 1 tie ) in metal mechanics using surveys were the least surveyed . Graph 3 .

The participation of Brazilian and foreign universities , enterprises , and governments was evaluated in terms of absolute values and percentages per year , as shown in Graph 5 . This figure shows that the participation of these bodies is superior to the participation of foreign universities , enterprises , and governments . The figure also shows that the participation of universities is much higher than the participation of the government and enterprises . Graph 5 shows that the relative participation of international universities increased during the last two events , and that the participation of international audiences has increased . The participation of international enterprises and governments is scarce and remains fairly stable during the four years under study . Graph 5 . Participation of the universities , enterprises and government in the IWACP From the graphs in Graph 6 , we conclude that the relations with the most cohesion are U - UNIP / BRAZIL / SP , U - UNICAMP / BRAZIL / SP , U - USP / BRAZIL / SP and U - IFSULDEMINAS / BRAZIL / MG , with four ties , and DC of 0 . 106 shows the low participation of governments and enterprises . According to De Nooy et al . ( 2005 ) , an analysis of the cohesion of a network enables the identification of the strongest ties , which represent the most important nodes of the relationships . The results indicate low participation in CP research , because of the absence of coordination and organization for the participation of Brazilian government agents . Here , there were just five participations ( G - CETESB / BRAZIL / SP , G - IPEN / BRAZIL / SP , G - IPT / BRAZIL / SP , G - INPA / BRAZIL / AM , G - IDR / BRAZIL / PR ) , representing 5 % of the actors in this network . It was found that 18 enterprises conducted joint studies with universities and governments on sustainability practices in CP . The enterprise that performed the most studies in cooperation with universities was the E - SEBRAE / BRAZIL / AM , with six ties , followed by E - TECNOAMBI / BRAZIL / RS , and E - SENAI / BRAZIL / RS , which had three external relationships . Another aspect identified in the analysis of the networks , as shown in Graph 6 , is isolated relationships . It is also important to clarify that the actors that are without ties only published internally , as is the case for U - UFTPR / BRAZIL / PR and U - UNISC / BRAZIL / RS . A proposition for this finding is that these universities are situated in regions with the most conservative cultures of Brazil , as is the case for the State of Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul . However , in the study by Yanhua et al . ( 2011 ) , one of the causes of isolation was an idiom - related problem . 566 ISSN 0034 - 7590 ARTICLES | The state of research on cleaner production in Brazil © RAE | São Paulo | V . 56 | n . 5 | set - out 2016 | 547 - 577 Graph 6 . Relationships among Brazilian universities with the largest numbers of ties with enterprises and governments 567 ISSN 0034 - 7590 AUTHORS | Geraldo Cardoso Oliveira Neto | Fábio Ytoshi Shibao | Moacir Godinho Filho © RAE | São Paulo | V . 56 | n . 5 | set - out 2016 | 547 - 577 Graph 7 shows that universities are related independently of geographic location , for example : ( i ) U - UAH / CHILE / SANTIAGO ( 2 ties , DC : 0 . 114 ) for U - UNIP / BRAZIL / SP and E - GRINOVER / CHILE / HURTADO ; ( ii ) U - NTNU / NORWAY / TRONDTHEIM , related twice with the U - UFRN / BRAZIL / RN ( 1 tie , DC : 0 . 057 ) with U - UNOPAR / BRAZIL / PR and E - INDEPENDENT / UK / RICHMOND . However , Yarime et al . ( 2010 ) states that collaboration networks are formed among countries that are geographically close , which contradicts the above findings . Another result is the participation of three international government agencies that did not have relationships . The main enterprises are consulting firms and service providers , which can relate to other universities and the government at the same time , for example , E - INDEPENDENT / UK / RICHMOND . According to Radosevic ( 2008 ) , enterprises that lead in innovation promote more studies . Table 3 was developed by selecting the strongest ties under each of the constructs studied . This table shows universities , enterprises , and governments and the most relevant relations among these constructs . Some findings arise from this table are as follows : • Brazilian institutions ( universities , government , and enterprises ) present a low level of relationships with foreign institutions . • Brazilian universities show far more external relationships than Brazilian enterprises do . This fact is the opposite of what happens overseas , where enterprises present more external relationships than universities do . • Many universities , governments , and enterprises show zero external relationships . This represents a gap and an opportunity for performing joint studies among these constructs . DISCUSSION The most researched CP topics in Brazil are environmental management , sustainable development , energy , environmental education , and waste management . These issues have deployment synergy and so are the most used in cases . For instance , a Brazilian organization that decides to implement CP needs to train those involved in environmental education , especially if they adopt an environmental management system focused on minimizing energy , water , and waste management . Therefore , the implementation of these thematics enhances sustainable development in Brazil . Karatzoglou ( 2013 ) confirm this result , and concludes that the adoption of CP principles in production systems is an excellent strategy for sustainable development . On the other hand , several important issues closely related to CP have received little attention , for instance , renewable energy and environmental responsibility . To increase research on these issues , the Brazilian government could ( a ) invest in research among universities , enterprises , and government , ( b ) reduce taxes for companies that use renewable energy and that are environmentally responsible , and ( c ) establish programs to promote environmental awareness among companies and people . The study on China by Chang et al . ( 2015 ) concluded that the government should establish financial assistance or provide sources of financing and investment in technical training to enhance the adoption of CP practices . Therefore , in developing countries such as Brazil and China , the participation of government agencies , enterprises , and universities is important to enhancing CP in industries . The application of research and business practices with renewable energy and environmental responsibility among Brazilian industries may also improve their competitiveness and enable them to commit to sustainable development . Additionally , CP research found that intensity - related CP principles are as the reduction and non - generation of emissions and resources , recycling / reuse of waste and emissions , and economic and environmental benefits are used more often . This is because the Política Nacional de Resíduos Sólidos ( PNRS , 2010 ) was published in 2010 , which advocated practical actions related to the management of industrial solid waste , thus motivating research . Furthermore , Brazil is a developing country . Thus , researchers seek to associate economic gains with environmental benefits achieved by adopting CP as a way to boost its implementation . Moreover , the principles of CP least studied are associated with the use of raw materials . This is because the majority of companies in Brazil do not use CP technologies . In order to change this situation , a simultaneous effort among companies , the government , and universities is necessary to promote such effort . Thus , the possible consequences are as follows : ( a ) reducing the consumption of natural resources ; and ( b ) contributing for companies to reduce their costs in the medium / long term . In this context , the main barriers are a lack of CP law in Brazil to promote environmental responsibility or the use of renewable energy , a lack of long - range vision by entrepreneurs who invest in Brazilian companies , and a lack of technology and specialized people able to work with renewable energy and promote the efficient use of raw materials . For instance , in China , the CP law was promulgated in 2002 to facilitate the development CP . This law was altered in 2012 to further promote CP , as indicated by Chang et al . ( 2015 ) . Vieira and Amaral ( 2016 ) emphasize that CP laws would enhance educational discourse . Another relevant aspect is that the most used research methods are case studies ( many of which are exploratory ) , theoretical descriptive research , and laboratory research , surveys , and bibliometric analyses . 568 ISSN 0034 - 7590 ARTICLES | The state of research on cleaner production in Brazil © RAE | São Paulo | V . 56 | n . 5 | set - out 2016 | 547 - 577 Other practical methods ( multiple case , surveys , and action research ) are scarce , and should be developed to spread the subject and promote practical application . To promote the use of this type of research , it is necessary to develop partnerships between universities and companies . This is rarely found in Brazil , and needs to be stimulated . In addition , the results should be presented in a more detailed way . A possible consequence of changing the observed situation is that the development of applied research tends to increase companies’ interest in CP technologies and methods . It is expected that this will lead to a virtuous cycle between research generation and the application of CP methods in Brazil , according to Leonidou and Leonidou ( 2011 ) . The method of analysis consists of evaluating whether the studies showed greater consistency in their results . Vieira and Amaral ( 2016 ) analyzed research on why CP is not widely adopted , and found that there is a need to improve CP application methods , which is related to the innovation of new methodological procedures . However , there are barriers to using action research and other research methods in the production system that negatively impact the adoption of CP in Brazilian industries . For instance , some companies are reluctant to share information , while others do not want to share negative results on the application of CP methods or environmental or economical results . Furthermore , resources from the Brazilian government are restricted , and there are few researchers exclusively dedicated to research . Chang et al . ( 2015 ) confirmed that in China , the acceptance by companies of CP provide opportunities to improve CP technical training , especially considering the motivation of researchers . Some of the most studied business segments within CP are metal mechanics , building , and agribusiness . This is because several companies in these sectors are located in Brazil . These business segments and their intrinsic characteristics are more familiar with CP . On the other hand , some of the least studied segments are landfills , petrochemicals , steel , mining , tanneries , and wooden artifacts . Thus , it is necessary to promote CP in these business segments . Karatzoglou ( 2013 ) states that sustainable development in countries may be enhanced with the implementation of CP in all business segments . For instance , Deng et al . ( 2015 ) indicate that opportunities exist to reduce the occupational risk in the tannery sector by minimizing carbon dioxide generation as a CP strategy . Rocha et al . ( 2012b ) added that the analysis of segments shows the scope and acceptability of sustainable development in a country . Changing this situation would spread the use of CP to sectors that have not been studied and can lead companies in these business segments to implement such technologies and methods . However , in Brazil , barriers that hinder the implementation of CP need to be reduced . For instance , the dissemination of funds granted by the Brazilian government in the case of projects related to the adoption of technological innovations in companies needs to improve . The Brazilian government provides financial resources for projects through Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo ( FAPESP ) . This finding was confirmed by Chang et al . ( 2015 ) , who state the need to improve communication among various business sectors as a way to increase research projects using funding . Other barriers preventing CP include entrepreneurs who are not sure about the benefits of adopting CP technologies and methods , and a lack of technology and specialized people able to work with CP . To overcome these barriers , communication in sectors on existing is required to encourage the acceptance by entrepreneurs and to improve the technical capacity of those involved . This result is common in developing countries , as pointed out by Chang et al . ( 2015 ) . The participation of Brazilian universities , enterprises , and the government is superior to the participation of foreign universities , enterprises , and governments . However , the relative participation of international universities has increased , as has the participation of foreign government agencies . However , 75 % conducted isolated studies . This finding was indicated by Romo - Fernández et al . ( 2012 ) , referring to the growth in government participation in studies . In order to improve this situation , it is necessary to increase external partnerships to boost foreign participation in events , which requires publishing papers that show the economic and social benefits of implementing CP . According to Radosevic ( 2008 ) and Romo - Fernández et al . ( 2012 ) , the government needs to organize the relationships among the government , universities , and enterprises . The studies by Wright and Pullen ( 2007 ) , Radosevic ( 2008 ) , Yarime et al . ( 2010 ) , Kneipp et al . ( 2011 ) , Chai and Xiao ( 2012 ) , Rosa et al . ( 2012a ) , Taticchi et al . ( 2013 ) , Rocha et al . ( 2013 ) , Avila et al . ( 2013 ) , and Du et al . ( 2013 ) indicate that large investments are necessary to boost research in universities . The types of businesses that show greater participation are consulting companies and service providers . In order to change this situation , the Brazilian government should develop joint research between universities and companies . An example of such an effort is the Brazilian Plano de Ação para Produção e Consumo Sustentáveis – 2011 – 2014 ( PPCS ) , which aims to organize the relationships among the government , universities , and enterprises . This result is corroborated by Radosevic ( 2008 ) , who states that success in the process of innovation depends upon joint action between universities and enterprises . Chang et al . ( 2015 ) agree on improving the system of communication between companies and universities to exchange experiences . For instance , in reviewing the literature , Riaz et al . ( 2015 ) show that most research on the use of CP in the manufacture of methanol is the result of interaction between companies and universities . However , the results indicate that 10 enterprises did not develop studies with universities and government organizations , and 569 ISSN 0034 - 7590 AUTHORS | Geraldo Cardoso Oliveira Neto | Fábio Ytoshi Shibao | Moacir Godinho Filho © RAE | São Paulo | V . 56 | n . 5 | set - out 2016 | 547 - 577 did not share the results in partnership with universities , primarily the E - RHODIA / BRAZIL / SP , with three internal relationships . This finding agrees with those of Boks et al . ( 2001 ) , who state that when enterprises publish , they do so in an isolated manner . In this context , it is suggested that enterprises can become more tractable for studies from universities with the support of government agencies , making it possible to integrate efforts in developing more detailed studies in the area of sustainability in production . Another relevant aspect of this analysis , identified in the study by Brito and Berardi ( 2010 ) , is that enterprises are influenced by the government and society to create and implement new sustainability practices in the production system . According to Vieira and Amaral ( 2016 ) , it is necessary to promote the dissemination of knowledge about CP to stakeholders , including businessmen , academics , government , and society . There are few relationships / partnerships among Brazilian and foreign universities , enterprises , and government . In order to improve this situation , it is necessary to create partnerships to generate research and practical applications among these bodies , according Vieira and Amaral ( 2016 ) . China , Italy , and Portugal , for example , have published various studies on CP . It is possible that a closer relationship with these countries would allow for the generation of more international submissions . This finding indicates that universities are related , regardless of their geographic location . However , Yarime et al . ( 2010 ) state that networks of collaboration are formed among countries that are geographically close , which contradicts the above findings . The lack of relationships / partnerships among universities , enterprises , and government is valid for Brazilian and foreign institutions . Many universities , governments , and enterprises show no external relationships . This represents a gap and an opportunity for performing joint studies among these constructs . To improve this situation , partnerships that generate research and practical applications among universities , enterprises , and government are required . This is in line with the findings of Radosevic ( 2008 ) and Romo - Fernández et al . ( 2012 ) , who claims the need of such relationships , along with government support . Some Brazilian universities are already developing partnerships in masters and doctoral programs . The analysis performed in this study supports the inquiries of Boks et al . ( 2001 ) and Radosevic ( 2008 ) in terms of the joint participation of universities , enterprises , and governments being important for the development of emerging thematics in sustainability . There are a number of possible consequences of changing the observed situation . Government support and the establishment of partnerships could increase the participation of international institutions in the event , which contributes to better quality articles and an increase in the level of the event . Partnership among universities and companies and the government tend to generate applied research , which increase the enthusiasm of companies to implement CP technologies and methods . It is expected that this will lead to a virtuous cycle between research generation and the application of CP methods in Brazil , with the population becoming conscious of the importance of sustainable consumption , leading to companies implementing CP . Furthermore , Brazil can learn from foreign experiences . This finding is consistent with Chang et al . ( 2015 ) and Vieira and Amaral ( 2016 ) on the formation of networks of relationships among the government , businesses , universities , and the community for the internationalization of CP research . On the other hand , barriers to establishing partnerships among universities , enterprises , and the government also exist between Brazilian and foreign institutions : scarce financial resources , low levels of internationalization of Brazilian universities on CP subjects , and a lack of laws in Brazil that incentivize CP . This result is consistent with Chen , Tang , and Feldmann ( 2015 ) , who refer to developing or underdeveloped countries who are looking for ways to improve their economies . For example , China understands the need to adopt CP as a means of promoting sustainable development , but is still at the trend level , according to Chang et al . ( 2015 ) . Brazil is currently in a political and economic crisis and focusing on ways to maintain or improve gross domestic production and , thus , has begun discussing laws of development , starting with the PPCS . Chang et al . ( 2015 ) focused on China , but the asymmetry with the Brazilian scenario suggests that the effectiveness of CP requires improving the institutional system focused on laws for implementing CP in industries , and recognizing opportunities to integrate CP with other environmental management schemes , for instance , emission reduction and energy conservation , total emission control , environmental impact assessments , and emission permits . This study expands the debate and discussions in this research area , which we believe to be its main contribution . The specific conference targeted to promote CP themes supported by the Journal of Cleaner Production creates important integration among universities , businesses , and the government . When researchers receive grants and incentives from the government or companies , they can develop improved techniques from which everyone will benefit . When the most effective CP procedures are implemented in several companies , research can establish a pattern . Moreover , successful cases and articles can spread the practices used in companies . The government can also benefit from this improvement , owing to the fact that this idea helps them to control the procedures applied in the companies and reduces the costs and investment of the government . For instance , the costs of water treatment become cheaper when CP concepts are properly applied . 570 ISSN 0034 - 7590 ARTICLES | The state of research on cleaner production in Brazil © RAE | São Paulo | V . 56 | n . 5 | set - out 2016 | 547 - 577 Graph 7 .

This framework shows the main points concerning the observed CP situation , how to change / improve this situation , and the possible consequences of change and removing barriers to change . This framework is shown in Exhibit 2 . Exhibit 2 . Framework of thematics , subjects , research methods , business segments , universities , enterprises , and the government Observed situation How to change / improve this situation Possible consequences in changing the observed situation Possible barriers to change the observed situation T h e m a t i c s ( i ) The thematic of cleaner production ( 219 ties ) is the central component of the JCP congress . Some important thematics closely related to CP are scarcely studied . Examples are : Renewable Energy ( 1 tie ) and Environmental Responsibility ( 1 tie ) . ( ii ) The most studied subjects within CP thematics are : Reduction and non - generation of emissions and resource ( 26 ties ) ; Recycling / reuse of wastes and emissions ( 21 ties ) ; Economic and environmental benefits ( 12 ties ) . The least studied subject within CP thematics is Efficiency of the use of raw materials ( 3 ties ) . ( i ) Both thematics ( renewable energy and environmental responsibility ) are scarcely studied in Brazil . In order to address this situation , government should : ( a ) invest on research together with universities on such topics ; ( b ) reduce taxes for companies which use renewable energy and are environmentally responsible ; ( c ) establish programs in order to promote environmental awareness in companies and people . ( ii ) Efficiency of the use of raw materials is a subject with little studies in Brazil . This is due the fact that the great majorities of companies in Brazil do not use or even consider to use cleaner technologies . In order to change this situation , a simultaneous effort ( companies , government and universities ) is necessary to promote such effort . ( i ) Research and application of renewable energy and environmental responsibility can lead Brazilian companies to improve their market opportunities and therefore , their competitiveness level . ( ii ) Efficiency of the use of raw materials can be useful for Brazil in the following ways : ( a ) reducing the consumption of natural resources ; ( b ) contributing for companies to reduce their cost in the medium / long range . - There is no law in Brazil that promotes environmental responsibility or the use of renewable energy . - Lack of long - range vision of entrepreneur who invest in Brazilian companies . - Lack of technology and specialized people able to work with renewable energy and to promote efficiency use of raw materials . R e s e a r c h m e t h o d s Concerning CP thematics , the most used research methods were case study ( a lot of them just exploratory ) , theoretical descriptive research and laboratory research . The least used research methods were multiple case study , survey and bibliometrics . Any action research paper was found . Although the existence of a great number of case studies , the great majority of them are just exploratory . Other practical methods ( multiple case , surveys and action research ) are scarce and should be developed in order to widespread the subject and promote practical application . To promote the use of this type of research it is necessary a partnership between university and companies . This is rarely found in Brazil and need to be stimulated . In addition , the results should be presented in a more detailed way , once a lot of the case studies found are only exploratory . The development of applied research tends to increase the enthusiasm of companies to implement CP technologies and methods . It is expected that this leads to a virtuous cycle between research generation and application of CP methods in Brazil . - Some companies are reluctant in widespread information . - Some companies do not want to widespread negative results concerning the application of CP methods or environmental or economical results . - Brazilian Government should release more resources for CP project implementation for companies - Limited number of researchers exclusively dedicated to research .

Framework of thematics , subjects , research methods , business segments , universities , enterprises , and the government Observed situation How to change / improve this situation Possible consequences in changing the observed situation Possible barriers to change the observed situation B u s i n e ss s e g m e n t s Some of the most studied business segments within CP were Metal Mechanics , Building and Agribusiness . Some of the least studied were Landfill , Petrochemicals , Steel , Mining , Tanneries and Wooden artifacts . Some business segments , for its intrinsic characteristics , are more familiar with CP . It is necessary to promote CP into the business segments little studied in the present research . The widespread of CP to sectors little studied so far can lead companies of such business segments to implement such technologies and methods . - Lack of knowledge of entrepreneurs about government investments in CP Technologies , especially for some sectors . - Entrepreneurs are not sure about the benefits of the adoption of CP technologies and methods . - Lack of technology and specialized people able to work with CP . U n i v e r s i t i e s , g o v e r n m e n t s a n d e n t e r p r i s e s ( i ) In the four years of the JCP congress , the participation of Brazilian universities , enterprises and government is superior to the participation of foreign universities , enterprises and government . The relative participation of international universities has increased during the last two events . The participation of international enterprises and governments is scarce and remain fairly stable during the four years of the events . ( ii ) The type of enterprise that have more participation in the event are consulting companies and service providers ( iii ) There is scarce relationship / partnership between Brazilian and foreign universities , enterprises and government . ( iv ) There is scarce relationship / partnership between universities , enterprises and government . This is valid in both , Brazilian and foreign institutions . ( i ) Increase the bonds of external partnerships to incentivize foreign participation in the JCP congress . In order to increase the participation of companies it is necessary to publish papers in which the economic and social benefits of implementing CP are shown . ( ii ) Brazilian government should incentivize the development of joint research between universities and companies . An example of such effort is the Brazilian PPCS ( Plano de Ação para Produção e Consumo Sustentáveis - 2011 - 2014 ) , which aims at organizing the relationship between government , universities and enterprises . ( iii ) Partnership to generate research and practical applications between Brazilian and foreign universities , enterprises and government . China , Italy and Portugal , for example , have published various studies about CP ; it is possible that a closer relationship with these countries would allow for the generation of more international submissions to the JCP congress . ( iv ) Partnership to generate research and practical applications between universities enterprises and government . One such initiative towards this direction is the development of integrated master’s and doctoral programs between Brazilian and foreign universities . - Government support and the establishment of partnerships will increase the participation of international institutions in the event , which contribute to attract better quality articles and increase the level of the event . - Establishment of partnership between universities and companies and government tends to generate applied research . - The development of applied research tends to increase the enthusiasm of companies to implement CP technologies and methods . It is expected that this leads to a virtuous cycle between research generation and application of CP methods in Brazil . - Population being conscious of the importance of the sustainable consumption leads companies to implement CP - Brazil can learns from foreign experience . - There are a lot of difficulties for the establishment of partnership between universities , enterprises and government and also between Brazilian and foreign institutions : scarce financial resources , low level of internationalization of Brazilian universities concerning CP subject , intensify control over environmental responsibility and create laws to encourage CP in Brazil .

The main goal of the study is to present and contribute to improving the current state of CP research in Brazil . First , we examined the thematics , subjects , business segments , and research methods studied in the JCP congress . Then , the affiliations ( universities , government , enterprises , and countries ) of the authors that participated in the four editions of the events were presented . In addition , the relationships among these constructs were elaborated upon . From these results , a framework was proposed . This framework ( see Exhibit 2 ) shows the observed CP situation for the constructs , how to change / improve this situation , the possible and the consequences of changing this situation and removing barriers to change . Based on this framework , we conclude that many thematics and subjects related to CP deserve more attention in Brazil . The adoption of CP by Brazilian companies has greater asymmetry with environmental education , environmental management systems , and ISO 14001 , aimed primarily at reducing energy , water , and waste and solid waste management . However , there is little research on renewable energy and environmental responsibility , showing that opportunities exist for research and contributions on sustainable development . Moreover , the results indicated that the implementation of CP should be disseminated to various Brazilian business segments as a means of enhancing sustainable development . While there are many remarkable accomplishments in the development of CP practices in Brazil , this is still only a trend . In general , to intensify CP in Brazilian companies we suggest improving the communication channels among government , enterprises , universities , and society in order to exchange experiences . In this way , shareholders and entrepreneurs will learn about the subsidies / funds to implement CP , allowing greater adherence to the implementation of CP practices . Moreover , universities , through their research programs , may help companies in their research , enabling innovation in terms of implementation and scientific methods . There is a need for more applied research , for instance , action research in operational reality to generate innovations . Therefore , society would be more educated , allowing for a continuous cycle of learning . Consequently , one should not think of sustainable development through CP , without considering the stakeholders ( government , enterprises , universities , and society ) . Development will only occur if the process is genuine and integrated . Note that in this process all stakeholders may benefit . Thus , sustainable public policies could be a reference and serve as a benchmark for other countries . Companies may minimize costs by reducing waste and still reduce their environmental impact , which can lead to more attractive investments and an enhanced competitive advantage . Brazilian universities could generate more innovation and promote internationalization and society that recognizes environmental education as a means of survival for future generations . However , developing countries ( e . g . , Brazil ) have serious difficulties in developing a government system with CP laws because of the central focus on improving gross domestic production as a matter of survival and that projects related to sustainable production and consumption are still trends in character . Such research has the potential for companies and the country to contribute to increasing their competitiveness level , manufacturing products in a sustainable way . Such research is mandatory to establish a relationship among Brazilian universities , government , and enterprises , as well as among these and foreign institutions . The Brazilian government should create laws specifically directed at sustainable production and consumption , which incentivizes and supports the development of such research . Finally , CP funding analyses and policy priorities are being turned into scientific priorities and scientific results ( Vasileiadou , Heimeriks , & Petersen , 2011 ) . This study provides the basis for future research , even though bibliometric methods have their limitations , according to Ferreira , Pinto , and Serra ( 2013 ) . However , the evolution of research is a cumbersome work and requires considering both objective and subjective aspects ( Tahira , Alias , & Bakri , 2013 ) . REFERENCES Ávila , L .
