Down - regulation or mislocalization of nephrin has been observed in diabetic kidney disease ( DKD ) , characterized by albuminuria . Here , we investigate the role of protein kinase C and casein kinase 2 substrate in neurons 2 ( PACSIN2 ) , a regulator of endocytosis and recycling , in the trafficking of nephrin and development of DKD . We observe that PACSIN2 is up - regulated and nephrin mislocalized in podocytes of obese Zucker diabetic fatty ( ZDF ) ratsthathavealtered renalfunction . In culturedpodocytes , PACSIN2and nephrincolocalizeandinteract . Weshowthat nephrin is endocytosed in PACSIN2 - positive membrane regions and that PACSIN2 overexpression increases both nephrin endocytosis and recycling . We identify rabenosyn - 5 , which is involved in early endosome maturation and endosomal sorting , as a novel interaction partner of PACSIN2 . Interestingly , rabenosyn - 5 expression is increased in podocytesinobeseZDFrats , and , invitro , itsoverexpressionenhancestheassociationofPACSIN2andnephrin . Wealso showthatpalmitate , whichiselevatedindiabetes , enhancesthisassociation . Collectively , PACSIN2isup - regulatedand nephrin is abnormally localized in podocytes of diabetic ZDF rats . In vitro , PACSIN2 enhances nephrin turnover apparently via a mechanism involving rabenosyn - 5 . The data suggest that elevated PACSIN2 expression accelerates nephrin trafficking and associates with albuminuria . — Dumont , V . , Tolvanen , T . A . , Kuusela , S . , Wang , H . , Nyman , T .

FASEB J . 31 , 3978 – 3990 ( 2017 ) . www . fasebj . org KEY WORDS : endocytosis (cid:129) recycling (cid:129) rabenosyn - 5 (cid:129) palmitate (cid:129) podocyte Diabetic kidney disease ( DKD ) , the renal complication of diabetes , accounts for 44 % of all end - stage renal disease cases requiring renal transplantation in the United States ( 1 ) . DKD occurs after decades of diabetes and is characterized by persistent albuminuria and declined glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) . The mechanisms un - derlying DKD are not fully elucidated , but injury of glomerular epithelial cells ( podocytes ) is involved . Podocytes participate in the ultrafiltration of plasma into urine together with the glomerular basement membrane ( GBM ) and endothelial cells . Podocytes are highly spe - cialized cells , and their foot processes interdigitate with adjacent podocytes . The foot processes are connected by special cell - cell junctions called slit diaphragms . Nephrin is a key protein of the slit diaphragm , in which it func - tions both structurally and via its signaling capacity [ reviewed by New et al . ( 2 ) ] . Mutations in the nephrin gene , NPHS1 , induce severe kidney failure due to ex - pression of a truncated form of nephrin or defective trafficking of mutated nephrin to the plasma membrane ( 3 , 4 ) . Similarly , a mutation in NPHS2 , encoding podocin , prevents efficient targeting of nephrin to the plasma membrane ( 5 ) , where nephrin normally locates in cav - eolin - 1 – positive lipid rafts ( 6 ) . This also results in de - fective renal function , which shows that localization of nephrin at the slit diaphragm is crucial .

Nephrin participates in controlling the structure of podocyte foot processes and actin cytoskeleton via phosphorylation of its key tyro - sine residues [ reviewed by New et al . ( 2 ) ] . Therefore , controlled trafficking of nephrin , and the subsequent coordinated signaling via nephrin , is essential for podo - cytes and glomerular permselectivity . Nephrin in - ternalization occurs via clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) or the lipid raft pathway , one of the clathrin - independent endocytosis ( CIE ) pathways ( 10 , 11 ) . The choice between the pathways might be critical for glo - merular function because the endocytic pathways have different dynamics and therefore apparently different im - pacts on nephrin signaling ( 11 ) . However , the mecha - nisms underlying the trafficking of nephrin after its internalization remain largely unknown . Protein kinase C and casein kinase 2 substrate in neurons 2 ( PACSIN2 ) , also known as syndapin II , is a member of the Bin - Amphiphysin - Rvs ( BAR ) family that contains an evolutionary membrane binding and sculpting domain . Specifically , PACSIN2 has an F - BAR domain , which induces negative curvature to mem - branes , and NPF motifs and an SH3 domain that bind to cytoskeletal , endocytic and recycling proteins ( 12 , 13 , 14 ) . In kidney , PACSIN2 is expressed in tubules , where it participates in repair processes after ischemia - reperfusion injury ( 15 ) . PACSIN2 is also present in podocytes ( 15 ) , yet its function has remained uncharac - terized . In this study , we investigate whether PACSIN2 regulates the trafficking of nephrin and whether PAC - SIN2 expression changes in DKD . MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell culture and preparation of cell lysates Wild - type mouse podocytes and podocytes stably over - expressing nephrin were produced and maintained as de - scribed in Wasik et al . ( 16 ) . Sodium palmitate ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO , USA ) was conjugated to free fatty acid - free bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) at a 3 : 1 molar ratio at 37°C for 1 – 2 h . When specified , medium was sup - plemented with 50 m M BSA - palmitate , and / or glucose con - centration was increased from 25 to 40 mM . Similar concentrations of BSA and / or mannitol were used as con - trols . Cells were lysed in NP - 40 or M - PER buffer ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA , USA ) supplemented with inhibitors as previously described in Wasik et al . ( 16 ) . Metabolic measurements and tissue preparation of Zucker diabetic fatty rats Lean and obese male Zucker diabetic fatty ( ZDF ) - Lepr fa / Crt rats were purchased from Charles River Laboratories ( Wil - mington , MA , USA ) . Blood glucose was determined with Elite Glucometer ( Bayer , Leverkusen , Germany ) . Serum and 24 - h urine samples , collected in metabolic cages , were ana - lyzed at the Biochemical Analysis Core for Experimental Research of the University of Helsinki using Advia 1650 ( Siemens , Munich , Germany ) . The estimated GFR was cal - culated using the creatinine clearance method following the formula C Cr = ( U Cr 3 V ) / P Cr , where C Cr is creatinine clearance ( ml / min ) , U Cr isurinecreatinine ( mg / ml ) , V isurinevolumeper min , and P Cr is plasma creatinine ( mg / ml ) . The result was ad - justedtotheweightoftherat . Glomerularfractionswereisolated from kidney cortices by graded sieving ( 17 ) and lysed in NP - 40 buffer . Freshly dissected kidney tissues were embedded in Tissue - Tek Optimum Cutting Temperature ( OCT ) compound ( Sakura Finetek , Torrance , CA , USA ) or fixed in 10 % formalin followed by embedding in paraffin . The protocols were ap - proved by the National Animal Experiment Board . Human glomerular lysate preparation Tissue was collected from the healthy part of the kidney from nephrectomy samples . Glomeruli were isolated by graded siev - ing with 425 / 250 / 150 - m m sieves ( Retsch , Haan , Germany ) and lysed in M - PER buffer for coimmunoprecipitation . The use of human material was approved by The Hospital District of Hel - sinki and Uusimaa Medical Ethical Committee . Antibodies The antibodies used are listed in Supplemental Table 1 . Immunoperoxidase staining Immunoperoxidase staining was performed as described in Wasik et al . ( 16 ) , with an additional incubation at room temperature for 1 h prior to incubation over night at + 4°C with anti - PACSIN2 IgG ( P2P ) . Images of 15 – 24 glomeruli per rat ( n = 6 – 8 per group ) were taken by a researcher blinded to phenotype . Randomized images were scored from 0 ( nega - tive ) to 5 ( strong staining ) by 2 researchers independently blinded to phenotype . Immunoblotting Podocyte and glomerular lysates were used for analyzing PAC - SIN2 ( P2B ) , nephrin ( Progen ) , and rabenosyn - 5 expression levels as described in Lehtonen et al . ( 18 ) followed by quantification with the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System ( Li - Cor Biosciences , Lincoln , NE , USA ) . Indirect immunofluorescence Kidney cryosections or cultured podocytes were stained as de - scribedinHeikkil¨a etal . ( 17 ) . SampleswereexaminedwithSP8or SP8 X confocal microscopes ( Leica , Wetzlar , Germany ) . For nephrin granularity scoring , images of 8 – 10 glomeruli of 5 – 8 rats per group were taken by a researcher who was blinded to phe - notype . Randomized images were scored from 0 ( smooth ) to 5 ( granular ) by 2 researchers independently based on the overall granularity of the nephrin staining , the presence of punctate ac - cumulations , and the continuity of nephrin signal along the GBM . Transient overexpression and knockdown Mouse PACSIN2 cDNA ( 13 ) was subcloned into flag - containing pCMV - Tag2B ( Stratagene ; Agilent Technologies , Santa Clara , CA ) or eGFP - N1 ( Takara , Kusatsu , Japan ) vectors using BamH1 restriction sites . Rabenosyn - 5 - eGFP plasmid was purchased from Addgene ( Cambridge , MA , USA ) . Cells were transfected usingLipofectamine2000 ( ThermoFisherScientific ) and used for experiments after 48 h . PACSIN2 ACCELERATES NEPHRIN TRAFFICKING 3979 Structured illumination microscopy Podocytes overexpressing nephrin and PACSIN2 - eGFP were incubated in complete medium containing nephrin 5 - 1 - 6 IgG conjugated with Attodye 647N ( 516 - 647N ; see Supplemen - tal Table 1 ) for 5 min , followed by surface - labeling with 516 - 647N on ice for 15 min and fixing with 4 % para - formaldehyde at room temperature for 15 min . Images were acquired with a structured illumination microscopy system connected to an Eclipse Ti - E inverted microscope ( Nikon , Tokyo , Japan ) and the NIS - Elements advanced research v . 4 . 5 software ( Nikon ) . Proximity ligation assay Proximity ligation assay ( PLA ) was performed as pre - viously described [ referred to as Duolink In Situ by Wasik et al . ( 16 ) ] . Single antibody reactions were used as negative controls . Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy Podocytes were plated on glass - bottomed dishes and in - cubated in complete medium containing 516 - 647N . Images were acquired with a total internal reflection fluorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy system connected to an Eclipse Ti - E inverted microscope ( Nikon ) and the NIS - Elements ad - vanced research v . 4 . 5 software ( Nikon ) . On / In - Cell Western assay Podocytes overexpressing nephrin were grown on 96 - well plates and transfected with flag - PACSIN2 or empty vector . For On - Cell Western assay ( Li - Cor Biosciences ) , cells were transferred onto ice and incubated with 5 - 1 - 6 IgG in PBS , 5 % fetal bovine serum for 15 min . Cells were fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min , blocked in blocking buffer ( Rockland , Pottstown , PA , USA ) , and in - cubated with IRDye 800 donkey anti - mouse IgG ( Li - Cor Biosciences ) in 1 : 1 mixture of Rockland blocking buffer - PBS , 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 . Nuclear marker DRAQ5 ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) was used for normalization . Detection and quan - titation were performed with an Odyssey Infrared Imager ( Li - Cor Biosciences ) . For In - Cell Western assay , cells were incubated with 5 - 1 - 6 IgG in complete medium for the in - dicated time and transferred onto ice for 15 min to allow binding of the antibody to nephrin newly exported to the plasma membrane . Cells were then processed as in On - Cell Western assay with an additional permeabilization with 0 . 1 % Triton - X100 for 10 min . Immunoprecipitation Lysates were precleared with protein G - Sepharose ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and incubated with anti - PACSIN2 , anti - rabenosyn - 5 or purified rabbit IgG ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) for 16 h at 4°C . Immune complexes were bound to rabbit TrueBlot beads ( eBiosciences , San Diego , CA , USA ) , washed with M - PER buffer , and analyzed by mass - spectrometry or immunoblotted . Protein identification by liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry Protein samples were analyzed by gel electrophoresis liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry as previously de - scribed ( 19 ) . The liquid chromatography - tandem mass spec - trometry data were searched with in - house Mascot through ProteinPilot interface against the SwissProt database ( UniProt ; http : / / www . uniprot . org / .

RESULTS PACSIN2 expression is elevated in podocytes of obese and diabetic ZDF rats To investigate whether PACSIN2 expression level is changed in podocytes in DKD , we used ZDF rats , which develop severe diabetes and renal defects ( 20 ) . Eight - week - old ZDF rats served as a model of early loss of glo - merular function , and 34 - wk - old rats served as a model of advanced renal failure . As expected , the obese 34 - wk - old ZDF rats displayed hyperglycemia , declined estimated TABLE 1 .

The FASEB Journal x www . fasebj . org GFR , andsevere albuminuriacomparedwithlean controls ( Table 1 ) . Analysis of kidney sections revealed elevated expres - sion of PACSIN2 in glomeruli of both 8 - and 34 - wk - old obese rats compared with lean controls ( Fig . 1 A – C ) . The staining pattern of PACSIN2 was typical for podocytes , surrounding the glomerular tuft , and particularly obvious in glomeruli of obese 34 - wk - old rats ( Fig . 1 A , arrows ) . Western blotting of isolated glomeruli confirmed a trend of increased PACSIN2 expression at 8 wk and 90 % in - crease at 34 wk in obese ZDF rats ( Fig . 1 D – F ) . Colocali - zation of PACSIN2 and nephrin appeared extended in glomeruli of 34 - wk - old ZDF rats ( Fig . 1 G ) , supporting in - creased expression of PACSIN2 in podocytes in DKD , which is in line with the immunohistochemistry data in Fig . 1 A .

PACSIN2 ACCELERATES NEPHRIN TRAFFICKING 3981 up - regulated in podocytes of rats with diabetes and ad - vanced renal defects . Nephrin displays a granular localization in glomeruli of obese ZDF rats , but its expression level remains unchanged Western blotting revealed no significant difference in the expression level of nephrin in the glomeruli of 8 - or 34 - wk - old rats ( Fig . 2 A – C ) . However , the smooth appearance of nephrin staining as a continuous line along the GBM that was observed in lean rats was altered in the glomeruli of obese ZDF rats ( Fig . 2 D ) . Already at the age of 8 wk , ir - regularities in the staining pattern of nephrin along the GBM and occasional punctate accumulations were ob - served ( Fig . 2 D ) . At the age of 34 wk , abnormalities were clearer and more frequent , as a dotted line often replaced the smooth nephrin staining along the GBM .

D ) Immuno ﬂ uorescence images showing that in glomeruli of both 8 - and 34 - wk - old lean rats , the pattern of nephrin staining displays a smooth appearance with a sharp lining of the GBM .

At 8 wk , the granularity score of nephrin staining in glomeruli of obese rats is higher but did not reach statistical signi ﬁ cance ( E ) . At 34 wk , granularity of nephrin staining is signi ﬁ cantly higher in obese rats compared to lean controls ( F ) . Scale bars , 30 m m .

Clathrinheavychain was found to partially colocalize with nephrin - positive punctate structures in glomeruli of obese 34 - wk - old ZDF rats ( Supplemental Fig . 1 A ) . No significant colocalization of nephrin was observed with rab5 , cathepsin D , or p62 , which are markers of early endosomes , lysosomes , and autophagic cargo , respectively ( Supplemental Fig . 1 B – D ) . However , punctate accumulations of nephrin colocalized with the slit diaphragm proteins CD2AP and podocin , the latter showing a remarkably similar granular pattern as nephrin ( Supplemental Fig . 1 E , F ) . Collectively , in obese ZDF rats , the expression pattern of nephrin becomes aberrant , although its expression level remains unchanged . PACSIN2 and nephrin colocalize and interact in vitro Using podocytes stably overexpressing nephrin , we ob - served that PACSIN2 and nephrin colocalize at the plasma membrane and on vesicles spread throughout the cyto - plasm , including the leading edges and the perinuclear area ( Fig . 3 A ) . This supports the hypothesis that PACSIN2 regulates several steps of nephrin trafficking . Next , we conjugated an antibody targeting the extracellular domain of nephrin ( 5 - 1 - 6 antibody ) to a fluorophore , hereafter re - ferred to as 516 - 647N . In podocytes overexpressing PACSIN2 - eGFP , a 5 - min pulse coupled with surface la - beling of nephrin with 516 - 647N followed by high - resolution structured illumination microscopy confirmed the colocalization of PACSIN2 and nephrin at the plasma membrane and on early endocytic tubules ( Fig . 3 B , arrowheads ) . Moreover , PLA showed that endogenous PACSIN2 associates with nephrin ( Fig . 3 C ) . PACSIN2 accelerates the trafficking of nephrin To functionally assess whether PACSIN2 regulates neph - rin endocytosis , we transiently overexpressed PACSIN2 - eGFP in podocytes stably overexpressing nephrin and incubated the cells in complete medium containing 516 - 647N . LiveTIRFmicrocopyvideosrevealedthatnephrinis internalized at large and stable or small and versatile structures positive for PACSIN2 - eGFP ( Fig . 4 A and Sup - plemental Video 1 ) . Additionally , nephrin endocytosis was observed in areas devoid of PACSIN2 - eGFP . We next transiently overexpressed fluorescently tagged caveolin - 1 and clathrin light chain ( CLC ) in podocytes over - expressing nephrin and incubated podocytes with 516 - 647N for 20 min prior to fixation . TIRF microscopy revealed that nephrin occasionally colocalizes with both caveolin - 1 – DsRedmonomer and CLC - eGFP ( Supple - mentalFig . 2 ) . Thisindicatesthatnephrin ispresentinboth caveolin - 1 – and CLC - positive coated pits and suggests that it can be internalized via both CME and CIE . Also , colocalization of caveolin - 1 and CLC with PACSIN2 supports that PACSIN2 regulates both CIE and CME ( Supplemental Fig . 2 ) . To evaluate whether PACSIN2 regulates the presence of nephrin at the plasma membrane , we transiently over - expressed flag - PACSIN2 in podocytes overexpressing nephrin . PACSIN2 overexpression doubled the level of endogenous PACSIN2 without affecting the expression of nephrin ( Supplemental Fig . 3 A – C ) . On - Cell Western assay Figure 3 .

PACSIN2 ACCELERATES NEPHRIN TRAFFICKING 3983 revealed that overexpression of flag - PACSIN2 reduced the amount of nephrin inserted at the plasma mem - brane by 65 % ( Fig . 4 B ) . Next , we knocked down PASCIN2 using short interfering RNA . This increased the amount of nephrin inserted at the plasma mem - brane by 87 % ( Supplemental Fig . 3 F ) , confirming that Figure 4 . PACSIN2 enhances nephrin endocytosis and turnover . A ) Live - cell TIRF microscopy analysis of podocytes overexpressing PACSIN2 - eGFP and incubated with 516 - 647N reveals that nephrin undergoes endocytosis in PACSIN2 - eGFP – positive spots . Arrowheads point to nephrin molecules which are internalized at either large and stable ( magenta ) , or small and versatile ( blue ) PACSIN2 - eGFP - positive spots . Arrowheads point at nephrin entering the cell in areas devoid of PACSIN2 - eGFP . B ) On - Cell Western analysis shows that overexpression of ﬂ ag - PACSIN2 decreases the amount of nephrin inserted at the plasma membrane ( n well = 33 – 34 ) . The results are expressed as arbitrary units , representing the intensity of nephrin staining normalized to the amount of cells measured using DRAQ5 staining intensity . C ) In - Cell Western analysis indicates that both empty - vector and ﬂ ag - PACSIN2 overexpressing podocytes have higher levels of nephrin stained after 60 min of incubation with the antibody followed by 15 min incubation on ice compared with the 15 - min incubation on ice only ( 0 min ) , ( n well = 36 ) . D ) The ratio of nephrin stained at 60 and 0 min presented in C reveals that nephrin turnover at the plasma membrane is higher in ﬂ ag - PACSIN2 overexpressing podocytes compared with empty vector - transfected cells . Each data point represents the average of a single experiment ( n = 3 ) in C . Scale bar , 2 m m . * P , 0 . 05 , * * * P , 0 . 001 . 3984 Vol . 31 September 2017 DUMONT ET AL . The FASEB Journal x www . fasebj . org PACSIN2 regulates the amount of nephrin present at the plasma membrane . The reduction of nephrin at the plasma membrane ob - served in flag - PACSIN2 – overexpressing podocytes could be due eithertoincreasedendocytosisofnephrin orslower delivery of nephrin to the plasma membrane . To distin - guish between these options , we used an In - Cell Western assay approach in which 5 - 1 - 6 antibody was added to the culture medium of podocytes overexpressing flag - PACSIN2 or the empty vector for 0 or 60 min . Sub - sequently , surface - bound and internalized nephrin was detected as in On - Cell Western assay with an extra per - meabilization step . At 0 min , less nephrin was detected in flag - PACSIN2 – overexpressing podocytes than in empty vector – transfected cells ( Fig . 4 C ) , which is in line with Fig . 4 B . Both empty vector – and flag - PACSIN2 – transfected podocytes showed a strong increase of nephrin staining after 60 min ( Fig . 4 C ) , when slightly more nephrin was detected in the flag - PACSIN2 – overexpressing podocytes compared with empty vector – transfected cells ( + 15 % , nonsignificant ) ( Fig . 4 C ) . This rules out the possibility that PACSIN2 overexpression prevents the delivery of nephrin to the plasma membrane . Strikingly , the ratio of stained nephrin at t 60 / t 0 , reflecting the increase of stained nephrin between 0 and 60 min , was signifi - cantly higher in flag - PACSIN2 – overexpressing cells compared with empty vector – transfected cells ( Fig . 4 D ) . The significant increase in nephrin staining ob - served at 60 min suggests that internalized nephrin recycles back to the plasma membrane . This was con - firmed by nephrin recycling assay ( Supplemental Fig . 3 G , H ) . Collectively , the data demonstrate that PAC - SIN2 overexpression accelerates both the endocytosis and recycling of nephrin , thereby enhancing nephrin turnover at the plasma membrane . Rabenosyn - 5 interacts with PACSIN2 and is up - regulated in podocytes of diabetic rats To define the mechanisms by which PACSIN2 regu - lates nephrin trafficking , we searched for novel in - teraction partners of PACSIN2 in wild - type podocytes by immunoprecipitation of endogenous PACSIN2 followed by a “ shotgun ” mass spectrometry ap - proach . Among the proteins identified , rabenosyn - 5 ( Mascot score , 45 ; P , 0 . 05 ) raised our interest because it has been shown to regulate the rate of endosomal recycling ( 21 ) . Reciprocal coimmunoprecipitations confirmed that rabenosyn - 5 and PACSIN2 form a complex in mouse podocytes overexpressing nephrin ( Fig . 5 A ) and isolated human glomeruli ( Fig . 5 B ) . Also , nephrin was observed in the precipitates , although its amount was fairly low ( Fig . 5 A , B ) . Western blotting revealed that the expression level of rabenosyn - 5 was increased by 1 . 8 - and 2 . 5 - fold in glomeruli of obese ZDF rats compared with lean controls at both 8 and 34 wk , respectively ( Fig . 5 C – E ) . Immunofluorescence microscopy indicated an increase in rabenosyn - 5 lev - els in glomeruli of 34 - wk - old obese ZDF rats , and the expression pattern suggested an increase in podocytes and other glomerular cells ( Fig . 5 F ) . Overexpression of rabenosyn - 5 increases the association of nephrin with PACSIN2 Next , we overexpressed PACSIN2 - eGFP or rabenosyn - 5 - eGFP in podocytes stably overexpressing nephrin followed by staining for endogenous rabenosyn - 5 or PACSIN2 , respectively . PACSIN2 - eGFP appears to colocalize occasionally with both nephrin and rabenosyn - 5 on intracellular vesicles all over the cytoplasm , con - centrating close to the plasma membrane and in the perinuclear area ( Fig . 6 A ) . Interestingly , overexpression of rabenosyn - 5 - eGFP led to a more vesicular localization pattern of PACSIN2 and nephrin in the juxtanuclear re - gion and appeared to enhance the colocalization of the 3 proteins ( Fig . 6 B ) . To confirm this observation , we quan - tifiedthe interaction between nephrin and PACSIN2 using PLA and found that the association of the 2 proteins in - creased by 90 % in rabenosyn - 5 - eGFP – overexpressing podocytes compared with cells transfected with eGFP alone ( Fig . 6 C , D ) . The increase in complex formation is specific because neither PACSIN2 nor nephrin expression level was affected by rabenosyn - 5 - eGFP overexpression ( Supplemental Fig . 4 ) . Palmitate enhances the association of nephrin with PACSIN2 To characterize which diabetes - associated circulating fac - tor increases the association of PACSIN2 withnephrin and thereby potentially enhances the trafficking of nephrin , we treated podocytes with high glucose , palmitate , or a combination of the two and measured the association of nephrin and PACSIN2 by PLA . High glucose alone ( 40 mM , 48 h ) did not increase the association of nephrin with PACSIN2 . On the other hand , treatment of podo - cytes for 48 h with 50 m M palmitate enhanced their as - sociation by 27 % and enhanced the combination of high glucose and palmitate by 32 % ( Fig . 7 ) . The increase in complex formation was not due to increased expression of PACSIN2 or nephrin ( Supplemental Fig . 5 ) . DISCUSSION Despite intensive efforts , regulation of nephrin trafficking has remained unclear . Here , we demonstrate that the F - BAR protein PACSIN2 enhances nephrin endocytosis and recycling back to the plasma membrane . This appar - ently relies on the newly identified protein complex con - taining nephrin , PACSIN2 and rabenosyn - 5 , here identified in cultured podocytes and human glomeruli . Moreover , the formation of the PACSIN2 - nephrin com - plex is enhanced by palmitate treatment . PACSIN2 decreases the amount of nephrin at the plasma membrane , suggesting a role for PACSIN2 in nephrin endocytosis ( Fig . 4 ) . This is supported by the presence of PACSIN2 - eGFP and nephrin on endocytic pits and early endosomal tubules ( Figs . 3 and 4 and Supple - mental Fig . 2 ) . These results corroborate the ideas raised in previous studies , suggesting that nephrin endocytosis occurs via both CME and CIE ( 10 , 11 , 22 , 23 ) and that PACSIN2 ACCELERATES NEPHRIN TRAFFICKING 3985 PACSIN2 regulates both CME and CIE ( 13 , 14 , 24 ) . In - terestingly , protein kinase C a ( PKC - a ) , up - regulated in diabetic glomeruli ( 22 , 23 ) , is known to directly phos - phorylate both nephrin and PACSIN2 ( 22 , 23 , 25 ) . PKC - a – mediated phosphorylation of nephrin regulates its internalization ( 23 ) , and the phosphorylation of PACSIN2 by PKC - a regulates caveolae - mediated endocytosis ( 25 ) . Thus , PKC - a could be a major regulator of nephrin traf - ficking in diabetic conditions by a mechanism potentially involving PACSIN2 . The fact that PKC - a deletion pre - vented the loss of nephrin expression in experimental DKD ( 26 ) further supports a role for PKC - a in the loss of kidney function in diabetes by regulating nephrin ex - pression and trafficking . Taken together , our TIRF mi - croscopy results and the results from previous studies demonstrate that nephrin internalization is complex and may occur via various pathways , some of which involve PACSIN2 . The entry of nephrin into the cell may depend on whethernephrin is damaged or engaged in signaling or whether the glomeruli need to adapt to varying hemo - dynamic conditions . Our study provides evidence that a significant amount of nephrin traffics back to the plasma membrane after in - ternalization ( Supplemental Fig . 3 ) . This is in line with the idea that nephrin and other slit diaphragm components have a high turnover rate ( 27 ) . We also show that PAC - SIN2 regulates not only endocytosis but also recycling of nephrin ; both processes are necessary for accelerated turnover of nephrin at the plasma membrane ( Fig . 4 ) . This issupportedbycolocalizationofPACSIN2withnephrininvariousintracellularlocations ( Fig . 3 ) . Previous studies show that PACSIN2 localizes to early / sorting endosomes ( EE / SE ) , tubular recycling endosomes , and the Golgi complex ( 28 , 29 ) . The novel interaction of PACSIN2 with rabenosyn - 5 further supports a role for PACSIN2 in the recycling of nephrin .

The FASEB Journal x www . fasebj . org shown to increase the size of the EE / SE compartment and to enhance the association of Rab4 and Rab5 and the recycling rate of transferrin ( 21 ) . In podocytes with en - dogenous levels of rabenosyn - 5 , PACSIN2 , nephrin , and rabenosyn - 5 rarely colocalize ( Fig . 6 ) , suggesting that the interaction of the 3 proteins is transient in normal condi - tions ( Figs . 5 and 6 ) . However , overexpression of rabenosyn - 5 attracted nephrin and PACSIN2 onto juxta - nuclear vesicular structures and enhanced their associa - tion ( Fig . 6 ) . Further studies are required to characterize the interplay and shared function of PACSIN2 and rabenosyn - 5 in podocytes . Previous work suggests that PACSIN2 is necessary for nucleation and scission of tu - bular recycling endosomes from rabenosyn - 5 – positive EE / SE ( 28 , 31 ) . Thus , their cooperation at the surface of endosomal membranes could contribute to changing the nature of maturing endosomes . Nonetheless , our results demonstrate a role for PACSIN2 in the recycling of nephrin , with a mechanism apparently involving rabenosyn - 5 . A role of rabenosyn - 5 in the trafficking of nephrin could explain albuminuria observed in a patient who carries a mutated form of rabenosyn - 5 ( 32 ) . In podocytes of obese and hyperglycemic ZDF rats , elevated expression of PACSIN2 and rabenosyn - 5 is associated with a granular pattern of nephrin and severe albuminuria ( Figs . 1 , 2 , and 5 and Table 1 ) . The punctate structures positive for nephrin were occasionally also positive for clathrin heavy chain , highlighting a potential role for endocytosis in the pathophysiological changes occurring in podocytes in diabetic conditions . Previous electron microscopy studies reported that podocytes of obese ZDF rats present vacuolization and droplets and have an increased capacity for endocytosis ( 33 , 34 ) . We observed that endocytosed nephrin wasnot trapped in the endolysosomal system ( Supplemental Fig . 2 ) , but the punctate structures stained with antibodies against nephrin were also positive for CD2AP , which regulates intracellular trafficking in podocytes ( 35 ) and anchors the slit diaphragm to the cytoskeleton by binding actin di - rectly ( 36 ) . Strikingly , podocin , which escorts newly syn - thesizednephrintotheplasmamembrane ( 5 ) , alsoshowed extensive colocalization with nephrin on the punctate structures ( Supplemental Fig . 2 ) . Therefore , one can spec - ulate that podocin participates in the trafficking of nephrin in both health and disease , and that in diabetes the traf - ficking is aberrant , leading to the formation of vacuoles and aggregates . Protein and fat droplets have also been observedinpodocytesofobeseZuckerrats ( 37 ) , amodelof Figure 6 . Rabenosyn - 5 colocalizes with PAC - SIN2 and nephrin and increases their associa - tion .

PACSIN2 ACCELERATES NEPHRIN TRAFFICKING 3987 diabetes from which the ZDF rats originate . Interestingly , a recent study observed granular localization of nephrin and podocin in a protamine sulfate – induced podocyte effacement model ( 38 ) , suggesting that abnormal traf - ficking of nephrin , along with podocin , is not limited to diabetes . It may be that in situations requiring fast glo - merular adaptation , such as in diabetes and protamine - sulfate model , an increase in the turnover of the slit diaphragm proteins may lead to the saturation of the trafficking machinery , resulting in improper sorting and creation of aggregates containing nephrin and possibly other slit diaphragm components . Palmitate , which is the most abundant free fatty acid ( 39 ) , is elevated in the circulation of patients with insulin - resistantdiabetes ( 40 ) . Strikingly , bothpalmitatealoneand in combination with high glucose led to an increase in the association of nephrin and PACSIN2 ( Fig . 7 ) . High glucose alone did not enhance the PACSIN2 - nephrin association , possibly because a 48 - h treatment was not long enough to mimic the constitutive metabolic pressure occurring in diabetes in vivo . This may also explain why the treatments did not change PACSIN2 expression level . Interestingly , palmitate enhances the activity of mTORC1 in podocytes ( 41 ) , and constitutive activation of mTORC1 leads to ab - errant localization of nephrin ( 9 ) , reminiscent of the gran - ular pattern of nephrin that we observed in ZDF rats . Previously , most studies have analyzed the expression level rather than the localization of nephrin in DKD and typically reported lower levels ( 7 , 8 , 26 ) or even up - regulation of nephrin ( 42 ) . These discrepancies may be explainedbythedifferentmodelsandmethodsusedorthe stage of disease analyzed . In diabetes , glomeruli are subjected to hemodynamic stress ( 43 ) , and podocytes must adapt to changing intra - glomerular pressure to maintain the covering of the GBM . Thus , it is possible that up - regulation of PACSIN2 and rabenosyn - 5 represents an adaptive mechanism aiming to maintain the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier by increasing endocytosis and turnover of the slit di - aphragm components , nephrin in particular . However , it remains to be analyzed whether PACSIN2 accelerates this turnover in vivo and whether accelerated trafficking of the slit diaphragm components prevents or worsens the de - velopment of DKD . Nonetheless , PACSIN2 may associate with renal pathophysiology , as suggested by our study and others . Indeed , PACSIN2 expression is elevated in proximal and collecting tubules in a model of ischemia - reperfusion injury , reflecting a potential role in tubulo - genesis ( 15 ) . In tubular cells , PACSIN2 also interacts with polycystin - 1 , which is mutated in polycystic kidney dis - ease , further supporting a role for PACSIN2 in the main - tenance of renal function ( 44 ) . In summary , we show here that PACSIN2 , nephrin , and rabenosyn - 5 form a complex in podocytes and pro - pose that PACSIN2 fastens up the endocytosis and in - tracellulartraffickingofnephrinbyamechanisminvolvingrabenosyn - 5 . The elevated expression of PACSIN2 and rabenosyn - 5 observed in DKD could reflect an attempt to adapt to the hemodynamic and metabolic stress , both deleterious for renal function .
