While climbing a hill on a bicycle , for instance , shifting gears increases the force on the wheels while limiting the pressure required on the pedals . However , energy has to be conserved , and because mechanical work is defined as force × displacement , an increase in force can only be obtained at the expense of displacement . Thus , although shifting gears allows one to develop the additional force needed to go uphill , speed is reduced as each pedal stroke produces a smaller turn of the wheels . Cells have similarly developed mi - croscopic force amplification strategies during evolution . Here , we discuss some amplification schemes for one of the major force generators in the cell—actin polymerization . Actin plays a ubiquitous role in cell motility and mor - phogenesis , spanning many scales of space and time . In fission yeast , for example , a miniature actin machinery only ∼ 100 nm across can induce the invagination of an endocytic vesicle in just a few seconds ( Picco et al . , 2015 ) . However , to sever the en - tire yeast cell , a cytokinetic ring forms with an initial perimeter of ∼ 10 µm and requires ∼ 30 min to drive division ( Proctor et al . , 2012 ) . These assemblies differ dramatically in both size and duration . In other species , considerably larger actin assemblies exist that reach the scale of centimeters , such as in muscle cells . Clearly , actin and its associated factors need to be specifically organized to achieve these different functions ( Fig . 1 ) . From a functional point of view , a key problem is to understand how the global architecture of an actin network allows forces that are produced at the molecular scale to be productive for the cell . In this respect , we can distinguish two sorts of components . Active components generate forces from chemical sources of energy and include molecular motors , as well as actin itself , which can push by polymerizing ( Kovar and Pollard , 2004 ) and possibly pull while depolymerizing . Passive components , such as actin cross - linkers , are essential but can only transmit forces gener - ated by other elements . The forces developed by an actin meshwork are deter - mined by the organization of its components . Ultimately , these forces must be sufficient to drive biological processes , and thus their scale depends on the physical characteristics of the cell . For example , in the case of endocytosis in yeast , the turgor pres - sure pushing the surface of the invagination outward reaches ∼ 1 , 000 pN , which the actin machinery must overcome ( Basu et al . , 2014 ) . During cytokinesis , the actomyosin ring also works against the turgor pressure , which produces high forces on the furrow ( Proctor et al . , 2012 ) . For both cases , these forces have been calculated from measured cellular parameters , particularly the turgor pressure and the dimensions over which the mem - brane is deformed . Hence , for these processes at least , the two ends of the problem are known : the forces produced by the mo - lecular components make up the input and the force required for the cellular process to occur represents the output . Yet the force balance within the system must be considered to understand how the actin machinery harvests the input to produce this output . In this comment , we focus on the transmission of forces produced by the polymerization of actin , setting aside turnover and the contribution of molecular motors . We discuss specifi - cally how the arrangement of the filaments in the system reg - ulates the amount of productive force . In many ways , the actin machinery behaves analogously to a cyclist : though its power is limited , it can “shift gears” to favor either more displacement ( high gears ) or more force ( low gears ) . The force generated by actin polymerization Actin polymerization can produce force . Indeed if an actin monomer in solution binds the barbed end of a filament , there is a change of free energy ( Δ G p ) and polymerization will occur if Δ G p < 0 ( Fig . 2 A ) . This reaction depends on the concentration ( C ) of monomeric actin and will take place only above a critical concentration ( C * of ∼ 0 . 14 µM ; Table 1 ; Pollard , 1986 ) . It is associated with Δ G p = − k B T ln ( C / C * ) , where k B is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute tem - perature . If actin is polymerizing against a load and produc - ing work ( W ) , the change in free energy is Δ G p + W . In this case , polymerization will occur spontaneously if the change is negative , i . e . , Δ G p + W < 0 . Consider an actin filament pushing against a force ( f ) applied parallel to the filament axis ( Fig . 2 B ) . Because the addition of one actin monomer pro - duces a displacement ( δ = 2 . 75 nm ; Table 1 ; Holmes et al . , 1990 ) , the mechanical work is W = f × δ . Forces that are an - tagonistic to elongation can impede actin assembly ( Peskin et al . , 1993 ) . The critical force under which the filament would cease to elongate is called the polymerization force ( f a ) . Using a physiological concentration ( C of ∼ 40 µM ; Wu and Pollard , 2005 ) , the polymerization force is thermodynamically limited The actin cytoskeleton drives many essential processes in vivo , using molecular motors and actin assembly as force generators . We discuss here the propagation of forces caused by actin polymerization , highlighting simple con - figurations where the force developed by the network can exceed the sum of the polymerization forces from all filaments .

Within such limits , the force developed by polymerization will depend on the con - ditions of assembly . Direct measurements of the polymeriza - tion force using single - molecule techniques are scarce . A first study used optical traps on bare filaments , giving a force of ∼ 1 pN ( Footer et al . , 2007 ) . By monitoring the buckling of filaments capped with formins , a second study found the force to be ∼ 1 . 3 pN ( Kovar and Pollard , 2004 ) . In both cases , the concentration of actin was an order of magnitude lower than in vivo , and the measured forces were in fact close to the the - oretical maximum under the experimental conditions . Here , we will thus consider that f a is within 1 and 9 pN . We further assume that an actin filament is able to elongate as long as the parallel component of the antagonistic force at its barbed end remains lower than f a , irrespective of the perpendicular components ( Fig . 2 C ) . We discuss various examples of force amplification in which the network develops forces that ex - ceed f a per filament , without breaking the thermodynamic re - quirement for actin polymerization ( Δ G p + W < 0 ) . The high gear : actin pushing forward A clear example of pushing by actin is found in filopodia ( Fig . 1 ) , which are thin tubular actin - rich cytoplasmic projec - tions extending forward and orthogonally to the leading edge of motile cells . Extending a filopod should require a force ( F ) > 10 pN ( Mogilner and Rubinstein , 2005 ) to overcome mem - brane tension and rigidity . In a filopod , actin is organized as a bundle of n parallel filaments . If the load is distributed over all barbed ends , then each end sustains a fraction of the total force ( F / n ) . Extension will then be possible only if the polymerization force is larger than the fraction of force experienced by each filament ( F / n < f a ) and thus requires sufficient barbed ends to distribute the force . Therefore , ten filaments are theoretically sufficient to extend a filopod . This quasi 1D organization max - imizes growth speed for a given amount of added monomers ; i . e . , it is the highest gear of the actin machinery . Assembling more filaments can increase the force , but because the molecu - lar forces are always equal to the productive force , there is no mechanical amplification . Intermediate gears : actin pushing with an angle In lamellipodia , actin filaments form a branched meshwork rather than a bundle . If each filament can produce the same amount of force parallel to its axis , the push on the membrane can be higher as a result of the contact angle ( usually θ = ∼ 54° ) at which actin filaments encounter the membrane ( Fig . 2 D ) . A force f a parallel to the axis of a filament corresponds to a proportional force perpendicular to the membrane ( f a / sin θ ) . The total pushing force ( F ) on the membrane , then , is the sum of such perpendicular forces applied by n filaments ( F = n × f a / sin θ ) . Because sin ( 54° ) < 1 , the productive force is increased . This occurs at the detriment of displacement achieved by each actin monomer , which is also proportional to the contact angle ( δ × sin θ ) . Importantly , the contact angle is not solely deter - mined by the branching angle imposed by Arp2 / 3 , the primary nucleating complex for branched actin filaments , because the branched network can adopt different orientations with respect to the leading edge ( Weichsel and Schwarz , 2010 ) . Thus , this quasi - 2D system works like a gearbox , where the coefficient ( sin θ ) can vary , allowing a lamellipod to generate nanonewton scale forces ( Prass et al . , 2006 ) . This idea can be extended to other architectures with vari - ous amplification factors . Consider , for example , the configura - tion illustrated in Fig . 2 E , in which two asymmetrically branched filaments engage the membrane , but only the long branch polym - erizes whereas the short branch provides support by transmitting force between the membrane and the filament network . Upon po - lymerization , the whole construction rotates around a pivot point at the base of the supporting branch , and the contact angle of the polymerizing filament becomes shallower in comparison to the symmetrically polymerizing configuration . Strikingly , this con - figuration can develop more force than the symmetric case , as an additional amplification ( x + y ) / x is associated with the lever arms ( compare Fig . 2 , D and E ) . This illustrates that the network force is not solely proportional to the number of polymerizing barbed ends . The geometry of the system , particularly the angle at which the filaments contact the membrane , and the lever arms can fur - ther affect and amplify the total forces generated by the network . Figure 1 . Different actin networks . Networks of actin filaments are essential for many bio - logical processes at the cellular level , and the organization of the filaments in space must be adapted to the task . Here , polymerization force ( orange ) of actin filaments ( red ) occurs near the plasma membrane ( blue ) . Linear filo - podia bundles with fascin ( black ) can produce high speeds , but represent a weak configu - ration for force generation . Lamellipodia are thin cellular extensions in which filaments are nearly parallel to the substrate on which the cell is crawling . The 2D branched network , created by Arp2 / 3 actin - nucleating com - plexes ( black ) , can produce higher forces at the expense of displacement . During endocy - tosis in yeast , actin forms a 3D network at the site of the invagination that appears roughly spherical , but the organization of actin fila - ments in space is not known . The coat structure ( yellow ) enables actin to pull the membrane inward and actin polymerizes near the base of the structure , where Arp2 / 3 nucleators are shown in black ( Picco et al . , 2015 ) . Endocyto - sis requires strong force amplification to pull the invagination against the turgor pressure . on M a r c h 24 , 2016 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published March 21 , 2016 Amplification of actin polymerization forces • Dmitrieff and Nédélec 3 The low gear : actin like a wedge To interpret in vitro experiments in which actin polymerizes around beads ( Achard et al . , 2010 ; Démoulin et al . , 2014 ) , it has been suggested that resistance from a load could cause actin to polymerize parallel to the surface . In this simple configura - tion , a filament is confined between a base and a load , which is pushed upward as the filament grows ( Fig . 2 F ) . The upward displacement of the load is determined by the thickness of the actin filament ( ε ) and by the lever arms x and y , relative to the pivot point . The result is nearly identical to the configuration in Fig . 2 E , but the new device offers better performance ; whereas the long filament in Fig . 2 E can bend all the more as it elon - gates , this configuration works well even with flexible filaments . In the geometry suggested by Fig . 2 F , the load is lifted by the filament thickness once the filament has polymerized over the entire base . In a more realistic 3D network , the relationship be - tween polymerization and displacement will not be as simple , because the arrangement of filaments in 3D networks is intri - cate . Nevertheless , the mechanical concepts remain valid and , in particular , polymerization parallel to a surface could lead to strong orthogonal forces . In yeast endocytosis , actin polymer - izes at the bottom of the network in a configuration resembling the wedge ( Picco et al . , 2015 ) . This may perhaps resolve the apparent mismatch between the number of polymerizing fila - ments and the force resulting from pressure ( Basu et al . , 2014 ) . The force generated by the network depends critically on the network architecture , as this determines the constraints under which filaments grow ( Carlsson and Bayly , 2014 ) . In general , the force that can be exerted on a load will also depend on the mechanics of the entire structure . Network elasticity allows the polymerization force to be stored as stress , whereas stress re - laxation by disassembly and turnover will decrease the force the network can exert ( Zhu and Mogilner , 2012 ) . Conclusion In 1D structures , such as filopodia , force balance forbids me - chanical amplification ; however , in 2D structures , the contact angle between the barbed end and the membrane provides a Figure 2 . Polymerization mechanics . ( A ) During polymerization , the addition of one actin monomer ( orange ) corresponds to an elongation ( δ ) at the barbed end of an actin filament ( red ) and is associated with a change of free energy ( Δ G p = − k b T ln ( C / C * ) ) . ( B ) The work required to push a load over a distance ( h ) with a force ( f ) is f × h , and thus assembly remains favorable as long as Δ G p + f × h < 0 . In the case where polymerization occurs straight against a load ( h = δ ) , the maximal force ( f a ) is f a = k b T ln ( C / C * ) / δ ( Hill , 1981 ) . ( C ) If the filament encounters the load with an angle ( θ ) , then h = δ sin θ and the maximal force is consequently increased : f θ = f a / sin θ . ( D ) In the branched network of a lamellipod , actin grows against the leading membrane at an angle ( θ = ∼ 54° ) . In the absence of friction , the force between the polymerizing tip ( orange ) of the actin and the membrane ( blue ) is perpendicular to the membrane . It can then reach a maximum magnitude of f a / sin θ . The sum of the forces produced by the two filaments is then ∼ 2 . 5 f a . ( E ) Higher forces arise by polymerizing with shallow angles . The device illustrated here is composed of a growing actin filament with a “leg” on its side . By elongating , the filament will induce rotation around the pivot point , where the leg is contacting the membrane . High forces can be exerted on a load supported at the branch point , as a result of the amplification achieved by the lever arm and contact angle . ( F ) The highest forces are generated if a filament polymerizes parallel to the surface . In the illustrated configuration , elongation of the filament will cause a load ( green dome ) to separate from the membrane . The maximal force is calculated as in E , except that anchoring has to be assumed at the pivot point to balance forces horizontally . The device can sustain high forces applied on the top of the dome because the upward movement is small compared with the elongation of the filament . Table 1 .

Configurations in which fil - aments grow parallel to the membrane , and thus act like wedges , produce the highest forces . Of course , energy conservation dic - tates that displacement is reduced as force is increased , such that there is a “cost” for force amplification . A key parameter of our considerations is the force that a polymerizing actin filament can support ( f a ) . Energetic con - sideration provides an upper bound of ∼ 9 pN , but so far direct measurements have yielded lower values , around 1 pN . Ther - mal fluctuations provide a scale to which this can be compared . At a given temperature ( T ) , the characteristic energy associated with thermal fluctuations is k B T , where k B is the Boltzmann constant ; at room temperature , the associated force ( k B T / δ ) corresponds to 1 . 5 pN . Hence , if f a is truly ∼ 1 pN , it would imply that actin polymerization is hardly more efficient than thermal fluctuations . It is to be hoped that future experimental studies , possibly closer to in vivo conditions , will reveal higher forces , as it would be truly astonishing if actin used only 10 % of the available energy . In conclusion , the architecture of a network determines the productive force , often in a nonintuitive manner . Hence , once a system has been well characterized experimentally , me - chanical theory should be used to balance the forces within the network . When this cannot be done , energetic considerations , in which the mechanical work of the forces are summed and com - pared , are informative . A thorough analysis of force transduc - tion in the system makes it possible to predict the most efficient architecture for performing a given task ( Ward et al . , 2015 ) , which is of outstanding value when comparing different modus operandi across species .
