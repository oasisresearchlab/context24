“Don’t fuck it up , Oliver ! ” Creating the eNuk Software : A Case Study of Community - based Participatory Design with Inuit In Rigolet , Canada by Oliver Cook A Thesis presented to The University of Guelph In partial fulﬁlment of requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Computer Science Guelph , Ontario , Canada c (cid:13) Oliver Cook , May , 2018 ABSTRACT “DON’T FUCK IT UP , OLIVER ! ” CREATING THE ENUK SOFTWARE : A CASE STUDY OF COMMUNITY - BASED PARTICIPATORY DESIGN WITH INUIT IN RIGOLET , CANADA Oliver Cook University of Guelph , 2018 Advisor : Dr . Daniel Gillis Inuit across Inuit Nunangat are experiencing shifts in health and lifestyle due to the eﬀects of climate change . Their close proximity and deep relationship to a region that is rapidly changing have resulted in circumstances that are undesirable and adverse to their quality and way of life . The eNuk software is an interdisciplinary project that is being co - developed by the Inuit community of Rigolet , Canada to facilitate the co - management of information useful for monitoring , disseminating , and engaging with the ongoing changes they experience . This thesis presents the creation of a prototype of this software over three research trips to Rigolet where we explored a community - based and participatory approach . We document and reﬂect on the process , the prototype that emerged , and local factors that informed the prototype . We propose this as a valuable approach to pursue in this context . The prototype is currently in use by community - members with continued iteration planned . iii Dedications For Nunatsiavut and Rigolet , truly you are a beautiful land . iv Acknowledgements I would ﬁrst like to thank my advisor Dr . Dan Gillis for his unending support , encouragement , and advice as a mentor and friend in this journey . None of this would have been possible ( and certainly much less enjoyable ) without the dedication , openness , and enthusiasm you bring daily to myself and all of your students . Thank you not just for advising but for adventuring ; for embracing and sharing every opportunity to teach , learn , and enjoy life . Thank you for showing me it’s not all about the work , but when it is , to care about it and make it something worth doing . There are endless other things I could list ( Baker St , plane rides , cabin stays , and crashed weddings ) , but I know you would tell me to quit fretting over these acknowledgements and ﬁnally submit . So I’ll just say thanks for basically everything . ( Oh , and for somehow letting me swear in the title , who would have thought ) Thank you to Dr . Ashlee Cunsolo and Dr . Sherilee Harper , my other “academic parents” , I could not have asked for better committee members and partners in this research . Thank you for trusting in a bunch of nerdy computer scientists and for being patient as we ﬁgured everything out along the way . It has been an incredible experience learning from both of you . The wealth of knowledge , wisdom , and experiences gained from your guidance has been both humbling and exceptionally rewarding . It’s hard to imagine that this would be the path I ended up on when I started , but I’m grateful for it and you all the same . Thank you to Dr . Blair Nonnecke for being an excellent committee member , pushing me to ﬁnish and to learn the knowledge needed to do so . Thank you to my examination committee and Dr . Joe Sawada as chair . Thank you to everyone on the eNuk team . Alex Sawatzky , you’ve been a wonderful companion in this often uncertain journey . From our ﬁrst trip to Rigolet , and certainly since then , you are someone I look up to and value highly as a student and as a person . I’m pretty sure you are the reason any work actually got done . Thank you to Dominic Gagn´e and Keefer Rourke , for their help in developing the eNuk prototype software . Thank you to Nic Durish for so readily jumping in and embracing this research with enthusiasm . Thank you to everyone else on the team past and present you have all been a pleasure and honour to work v beside . I don’t think there is more supportive , helpful , encouraging , a positive team I could have been a part of . I want to extend my utmost appreciation and thank you to the community of Rigolet , who have been instrumental partners in this research . It has been a privilage to have been welcomed into your community and lives . Thank you for trusting and sharing in your experiences , knowledge , and voices that have made this research what it is . I eagerly anticipated every visit and too soon departed from them . Thank you to Inez Shiwak and Charlie Flowers for being invaluable cornerstones and leaders of the project . Thank you to Sandi , Karl , and Daniel for your : hospitality , trips to the cabin , excellent food , and of course for the quote giving me perhaps the best thesis title possible . Thank you to the Nunatsiavut Gonvernment as well as the Rigolet Inuit Community Government . Thank you so much to my family , who have been such a large part of getting me through this . My parents for never being short on words of encouragement and for always welcoming me home to relax and eat some real food . I can say in hindsight now , thank you for all the shopping trips to “make sure I don’t freeze to death in the cold” ( or die on a boat , or by quicksand , or whatever other danger might befall me ) . Thank you to my brothers , Simon and Julian , for being inspirations and continuous sources of motivation . Whether it’s a call to think things through , vent , or just as a distraction you’ve always been there for me . Thank you to all of my friends , who somehow put up with me when I disappeared for months on end , and for being there when I showed back up needing to talk or just to hangout with some video games and a beer . I would also like to acknowledge that this research took place in the ancestral and continued homelands of Inuit of the Labrador Inuit Settlement region of Nunatsiavut . This work is also supported by researchers from : the Labrador Institute , located on the homelands of the Innu and Inuit of Labrador ; and the University of Guelph , located on the ancestral and treaty lands of the Attawandaron people and Mississaugas of the Credit . Thank you to Health Canada , Polar Knowledge Canada , the Canadian Internet Registration Authority’s Community Investment Program , and all of the ogranizations and institutions that provided support and funding . Finally , thank you to everyone I should have mentioned but didn’t , this is a small fraction of the immense help and support I recieved . I appreciate you all . vi Contents List of Tables ix List of Figures x 1 Introduction 1 1 . 1 Climate change . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2 1 . 2 Climate change and Canadian Inuit . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3 1 . 3 Approaches to climate adaptation research . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 1 . 4 Information technology for adapting to climate change . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5 1 . 5 Participatory design of interactive software systems . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 6 1 . 6 Participatory design methods , tools , and techniques . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 7 1 . 7 The eNuk software . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8 2 Design process : methods 9 2 . 1 Research setting : Rigolet , Nunatsiavut . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 11 2 . 2 Phase 1 : Exploratory investigations and problem setting . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12 2 . 2 . 1 Cultural Immersion and Observation of Practice . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 13 2 . 2 . 2 Assessment of technological capacity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 14 2 . 2 . 3 Open house and public engagement . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 15 2 . 3 Phase 2 : Evaluating initial assumptions and eliciting functionality . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 16 2 . 3 . 1 Updating themes and continued immersion . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 17 2 . 3 . 2 Identifying features . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18 2 . 3 . 3 Open -

led by the Inuit community of Rigolet , Nunatsiavut , Canada to better understand the relationships between the environment , health , and climate change as it exists in the community . As a component of this project , software tools are being pro - duced with the community to facilitate the collection , interpretation , and dissemination of information useful for monitoring and managing the ongoing changes they experience through community - based monitoring . This thesis documents the design of a prototype of this software that was produced over three research trips to Rigolet where we were able to engage in participatory design activities and software development . “Don’t fuck it up , Oliver ! ” , as referenced in the title of this thesis dissertation , is a direct quote from an interviewed community - member on the importance of the eNuk project’s success . A simple phrase , it has stuck with us throughout the project for its power to succinctly articulate many of our experiences working with the community , the design process , and the eNuk software as a whole . It speaks to the passion and urgency felt by the community as they face challenges of climate change threatening their way of life . It speaks to the trusting and familiar relationships we strove to cultivate between ourselves and our community - partners to ensure that the project’s inﬂuence was seen as not just another research project , but as a meaningful and desired part of community life . It speaks to the community as not impartial spectators to the project’s outcomes , but as actively inﬂuenced by them and with a right to shape them accordingly . Finally , it speaks to the responsibilities of a community - based researcher to own and be reﬂective of the impacts of their work . While this document presents much of what went into the eNuk app , it was the community through the many conversations and actions we shared that made the project and this research what it is . “Don’t fuck it up , Oliver ! ” wasn’t made as simply a suggestion . It was an emphatic sentiment by the community in the 1 face of a problem that holds immediate importance . Climate change is not a far oﬀ threat to be witnessed , it is a pressing and continuous experience in our community - partners lives . Eﬀective and appropriate responses to this problem are not a luxury , optional or a convenience , but a necessity for sustaining life for Inuit . The repercussions for failing in this task fall far beyond the interests of academic research and have real direct implications for the people of Rigolet with limited room for second chances . This chapter provides context on the relationship between Inuit health and climate change , how this relationship can be researched in locally appropriate ways , and the participatory approach that was used to design the software for this project . 1 . 1 Climate change Far reaching eﬀects to human and ecological systems are being observed and are predicted worldwide as a result of climate change , including warming of the atmosphere and oceans , changes to the cryosphere ( persistent areas of frozen land and water ) , and rising sea levels [ 1 ] . The human - caused nature of many of these changes are supported by a large and growing base of evidence [ 2 ] . Coinciding with , and as a result of climatic changes , are direct and indirect impacts on human health [ 3 ] . For instance , the increasing severity , duration , and frequency of extreme weather events such as heat - waves , droughts , ﬂoods , storms and forest ﬁres can result directly in increased injury , death , and heat - related morbidity [ 4 ] . Indirectly , impacts to human health are mediated complexly through natural and human factors . Human health changes have been documented in disease patterns , air quality , food systems , occupational health , mental health , and global conﬂict [ 3 ] . In response to the widespread and far - reaching implications to health , climate change has been called “the greatest global health threat of the 21st century” [ 5 ] . Though global in scale , the health outcomes due to climate change are not experienced by the world’s populations equally [ 6 ] . The eﬀects are highly diverse , dynamic , and inﬂuenced by a range of factors in - cluding socioeconomic and geographic [ 5 ] . For example , while high income countries are responsible for the largest production of harmful greenhouse gases causing climate change , the negative repercussions are being disproportionately felt by the poorest and most vulnerable groups and countries [ 7 ] . The diverse health - related outcomes of climate change make it worthwhile to investigate how speciﬁc groups and regions are aﬀected respective of their unique circumstances and characteristics [ 8 ] . Among those most impacted by their changing climatic and environmental conditions are Inuit who reside across the Circumpolar North [ 9 ] . 2 1 . 2 Climate change and Canadian Inuit Inuit are an Indigenous peoples primarily living in Russia , Greenland , Alaska , and Canada . Indigenous peoples world - wide are being aﬀected by climate change [ 10 ] . This is , in part , due to the close relationships and dependencies many Indigenous peoples share with the regions and ecosystems undergoing the most rapid climatic and socioeconomic change [ 11 ] . Though vulnerable to these climate change eﬀects , Indigenous peoples exhibit extensive capacity to adapt to these changes [ 9 ] . Despite this demonstrated capacity to adapt , Indigenous perspectives and voices remain limited in climate research and action [ 12 , 13 ] . Within Canada , 65 , 025 people identiﬁed as Inuit in 2016 [ 14 ] . Most Inuit live in Inuit Nunangat , the traditional homeland of Inuit , encompassing the land , water , and ice that comprises the majority of Northern Canada [ 15 ] . The settled land claims in Inuit Nunangat includes four regions : the Inuvialuit Settlement Re - gion ( Northwest Territories ) , Nunavut , Nunavik ( Northern Quebec ) , and Nunatsiavut ( Northern Labrador ) . These regions are shown in Figure ( 1 . 1 ) . Fifty - three communities are contained in these regions , with ﬁve located in Nunatsiavut . Inuit communities in Nunatsiavut are remote and coastal , accessible seasonably by plane year - round , or seasonally by boat or ice and snow travel [ 16 ] . Figure 1 . 1 : Map of Inuit Nunangat and its four regions . Left to right : Inuvialuit , Nunavut , Nunavik and Nunatsiavut 3 Warming of the Arctic , including the Canadian Arctic and Sub - Arctic , represents the most dramatic temperature regime shifts globally [ 17 ] . Inuit communities have been experiencing and witnessing changes for decades [ 18 ] , with notable examples in sea - ice conditions [ 19 ] , weather persistence [ 20 ] , and ecology [ 21 ] . These changes have shown to considerably aﬀect Inuit health and wellbeing on mental health [ 22 ] , exposure to waterborne disease [ 23 ] , food security [ 24 ] , and subsistence hunting , gathering , and trapping practices [ 25 ] . Climate change additionally acts as a stressor for a range of existing health inequities that Inuit expe - rience , especially in comparison to non - Indigenous Canadians [ 10 ] . For example , lower life expectancy and higher rates of mortality , suicide , and infectious disease all contribute towards a considerable health gap for Inuit in Canada [ 26 , 27 , 28 ] . Broader socioeconomic disparities exist as well , including income distribution , housing , and poverty [ 29 , 30 ] . In part , health inequalities for Inuit in Canada can be attributed to lasting systemic issues resulting from an ongoing history of colonization [ 31 , 32 , 29 ] . This legacy is felt through diverse mechanisms includ - ing environmental relationships , social policies , and political power . Forced relocation , land dispossession , political disenfranchisement , and systemic marginalization have resulted in social , cultural , and economic circumstances that underly adverse health conditions [ 29 ] . Inuit participation in research is necessary in response to these challenges [ 33 ] . The Inuit representational body , Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami ( ITK ) , has made calls for increased Inuit repre - sentation in many aspects of Canadian discourse , ﬁghting for increased Inuit perspectives in science , policy , and research [ 34 , 35 ] . In 2015 , The Canadian Government released the Truth and Reconciliation Commission : Calls to Action , and a multi - volume report that outlines the Canadian Government’s proposed steps towards their reconciling with Indigenous Canadians , wrapping up a six - year program examining the legacy of the “Indian Residential School Systems” , an atrocity of colonialism experienced by Indigenous communities in Canada , including Inuit [ 36 ] . Though far from conclusive of this topic , it marks a step towards governmental eﬀorts to reconcile the relationship between Indigenous peoples , the federal government , and Canadians . Locally - appropriate , culturally - relevant and community - led strategies are needed across the Circumpolar North to address these pressing health impacts due to climate change . Community - based participatory research and community - based monitoring approaches are such strategies that have emerged with success thus far . 4 1 . 3 Approaches to climate adaptation research Community - based , participatory research ( CBPR ) strategies are promising approaches for researching cli - mate change impacts in a locally driven and informed way [ 37 ] . CBPR focuses on engaging community perspectives in all phases of research , from project initiation through to disseminating results [ 38 ] . The CBPR approach is strongly action oriented , working not only to examine the impacts of climate change , but to also develop community resilience to them [ 38 ] . CBPR has been used across Canada for both health and climate change research [ 33 ] . Complementary to the CBPR approach , is the use of community - based monitoring ( CBM ) programs for data collection , analysis , and interpretation through collaborative citizen participation [ 39 ] . Community - based monitoring is closely related to community - based research in their shared commitment for engagement and interpretation of research outcomes by communities . Prominent community - based monitoring programs have emerged including the Sustainable Arctic Observing Network ( SAON ) [ 40 ] , Exchange for Local Obser - vations and Knowledge of the Arctic ( ELOKA ) [ 41 ] , circumpolar monitoring program of the Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna ( CAFF ) working group of the Arctic Council [ 42 ] . What is being monitored , to what degree , by whom , and how monitoring is done , depends on the project , its goals , and the community with a wide range of approaches available [ 39 , 43 ] . Inuit have a long standing history of eﬀectively understanding , maintaining , and monitoring the environment , and show a great resilience and capacity to adapt to climatic and environmental changes [ 44 ] , and the integration of Inuit sciences and Western sciences are foundational to these community - base programs [ 45 ] . 1 . 4 Information technology for adapting to climate change There have been calls for increased information communication technology ( ICT ) development and data management programs to support monitoring and communication at local levels [ 39 , 46 , 47 , 41 ] . Challenges and gaps in Inuit health data have contributed to the health inequalities between Inuit and non - Inuit in Canada with issues arising around coverage and quality , jurisdiction and utility , governance and relevance , and infrastructure and human resource capacity [ 48 ] . Bolstering information and communication systems in the North with Inuit informed and developed software can , therefore , be seen as beneﬁcial . The eNuk project seeks to accomplish this type of engagement in ICT development with the Inuit community of Rigolet , Nunatsiavut , Labrador , Canada . Rigolet is a remote ﬂy in community located in the Nunatsiavut region along the coast of Labrador . It is the southern - most Inuit community in Nunatsiavut with a population of 305 , 91 % of whom identify as Inuit as of the 2016 Canadian Census [ 49 ] . 5 The eNuk software primarily faciliates Rigolet community - members ability to make multimedia digital observations of health and environment changes using mobile devices through a custom designed native iOS application . Currently in the early stages of development , the eNuk software was created in partnership with community members in Rigolet to best represent the individual needs of its diverse members . Recognizing the challenges of addressing many of the cultural and social concepts involved during the project in software development , a robust and inclusive approach was required to bridge the gap between eﬀective software production and the contextual factors driving our design space . The eNuk software’s development approach draws elements from the participatory design ( PD ) tradi - tion , a multidisciplinary systems design approach at the intersection of design sciences and technology [ 50 ] . Participatory design emphasizes collaborative co - realization of design outcomes by incorporating end - user and user perspectives in all facets of the design process and methods [ 51 ] . We take inspiration broadly from this ﬁeld , and from our community - based research team , in a synthesis of methods useful in engaging users with a desire to adequately incorporate their dynamic lived experiences into the designed technology . 1 . 5 Participatory design of interactive software systems Participatory design , in some form , can be seen across a multitude of application areas , such as industrial product design , architecture , and health information systems under a variety of nomenclature [ 52 ] . Drawing knowledge and methods from a breadth of professional domains and academic disciplines , it is most char - acterized as an overarching ﬁeld or approach to design uniﬁed by the shared intent for the involvement of the user in the designed elements of their lives [ 51 ] . Though resistant to a singular ubiquitous deﬁnition , a suitable description comes from Simonson and Robertson 2012 ( page 2 ) , who characterize PD as : “a process of investigating , understanding , reﬂecting upon , establishing , developing , and sup - porting mutual learning between multiple participants in collective ‘reﬂection in action’ . The participants typically undertake the two principle roles of users and designers where the design - ers strive to learn the realities of the users’ situation while the users strive to articulate their desired aims and learn appropriate technological means to obtain them . ” This perspective has been gaining traction in information technology and systems development groups , where user involvement has a history of being considered beneﬁcial to systems success [ 53 ] . The particulars of this involvement are often debated , shifting in position and extent throughout software development models [ 54 ] . While many contemporary approaches to software development can broadly be considered user - centered , participatory design aims to go further , moving towards the design of systems with users and 6 not just for them [ 55 ] . This positioning can have widespread implications for the user and process in the methods , outcomes , scope , and resources required compared to other approaches [ 56 ] . Historically , PD has been used predominantly in workplace settings reﬂective of its roots in Scandinavian business sectors and worker’s unions [ 57 , 58 ] . It has since been expanding to encompass further contexts as technology moves into the rest - of - life areas of society [ 59 ] . Applications with “marginalized peoples” [ 60 ] and community computing [ 61 , 62 ] have been documented ; however , to our knowledge , this approach has not been used in Inuit contexts . 1 . 6 Participatory design methods , tools , and techniques The methods for conducting participatory design are diverse , which reﬂect its multidisciplinary nature [ 63 , 64 ] . PD is framed around customizability and the mixing of tools and techniques to meet individual use situations , rather than as a one - size - ﬁts - all approach [ 63 ] . Overarching concerns of the participatory design approach involve ensuring users have a say in design often while learning how to design and build software themselves , encouraging mutual learning between all parties , and facilitating equal opportunity to design ( co - realization ) [ 51 ] . Comparisons of PD with CBPR and other participatory methods have also been described in the literature , with noted overlap in approach and the potential for mixing of ideas [ 65 ] . Though this remaisn early and limited in scope . Community - based research , interviews , focus groups , and other descriptive techniques all have long histo - ries in bringing researchers into the world of the technology user and better understanding their existing work and life practices [ 66 ] . These types of qualitative research techniques ﬁt well within PD practices , closely related to and growing from the robust world of ethnomethodology and community - based participative re - search [ 67 ] . Within PD , these can often take the framing of “design ethnography” , interweaving the study of people and their everyday practices with the active creation and use of tools and artifacts [ 68 ] . Design ethnography in practice entails conducting design activities in the community , bringing systems designers and the users into contact with the challenges and use situations in person to understand the current ‘here and now , ’ while also promoting new ways of doing their desired activities [ 68 ] . The construction and evaluation of intermediary iterative prototypes by systems designers and users alike is also a recognized technique in PD [ 69 ] . While software prototypes are now quite common in software development , they can often take an overly consultative relationship with the user , involving them primarily as a source of evaluation , but largely dissociated with the prototype’s design [ 70 ] . PD emphasizes integrating the user in the creative aspects of design in cooperative and collaborative prototyping , with many generative 7 activities being central to the practice of PD [ 71 ] . These activities have users designing artifacts that physically realize and bring to life their desired futures and extend the evaluation of these products outside of controlled testing scenarios into real life use environments [ 72 ] . 1 . 7 The eNuk software With the eNuk software , its design took place over three research trips ( October 2015 , February 2016 , August 2016 ) to Rigolet , Nunatsiavut . During these trips we and community - partners could engage in design activities and take part in what life is like in Rigolet . This design period resulted in a functional software prototype that is being evaluated within the community , and is in preparation for continued iteration and expansion . Chapter 1 ( Introduction ) introduced some of the concepts surrounding climate change , its relation to health and particularily the need for research and technology born from Inuit voices and perspectives across Canada . Chapter 2 ( Design process : methods ) covers the phases and methods of the design process as we explored a participatory approach with community - partners during each of the community visits and in the prototype’s development . Chapter 3 ( Design outcomes : Results ) outlines and summarizes some of the important contributions that came out of the eNuk software , including the process itself , the functionality of the eNuk software prototype , and some observed themes that contribute to the successful adoption of the software by the community . Chapter 4 ( Conclusion ) concludes with the prospective future expansion of the software within Rigolet and beyond as well as reﬂections on the impacts and implications of the project from our use of participatory methods so that we may inform our own and future software projects . 8 Chapter 2 Design process : methods This chapter provides an overview of the processes undertaken by both community - partners and researchers in designing the eNuk app . Methods used in PD vary greatly in practice and depend largely on the intended application area . A review by Kensing 2003 demonstrates that there are few full - ﬂedged PD methods ( but many tools and tech - niques ) . PD as such is not typically approached as a “one - size - ﬁts - all” solution to design with practitioners adapting to situations rather than the the use of universally applicable methods . As such , this thesis does not purport to present the method of PD to be used when developing a community - led application with a remote Inuit community , but instead oﬀers a speciﬁc example and case - study that can be used to support the development of a formal PD framework and to provide further insight into some of the technological and development considerations involved . The development of such a frame - work , however , is outside the scope of the current thesis , and left as future work . Looking at existing methods , the typical PD project has usually been targeted at designing for “professional work” , that is with formal workplace organizations and professions in mind . Many of the methods that have emerged so far reﬂecting this workplace orientation . Some examples of historically inﬂuential and widely recognized methods include the work done on models such as : STEPS , MUST , CESD , and use - oriented design . Each of these methods provide a diﬀerent lens to looking at PD in practice , approaching and emphasizing certain aspects or themes . A short description for each is as follows : 1 . STEPS - co - development of usage and software for socially embedded systems [ 73 ] 2 . MUST - participatory design for contemporary business needs [ 74 ] 3 . CESD - Tool perspective , “making good tools for skilled workers” [ 75 ] 9 4 . use - oriented design - application perspective , designing for “use before use” [ 76 ] Participatory design of software for community settings is less explored than its use in the workplace but some examples have been done that provide a background of existing work when exploring the community as a promising application . Though there are no examples of participatory software design with Inuit that came up in our review , three notably established projects that worked with communities of diﬀerent types are : the Blacksburg Electronic Village , Civic Nexus , and Neighborhood Networks projects . These projects paint a broad review of this part of community work in the ﬁeld as well as its goals . The Blacksburg Electronic Village ( BEV ) involved researchers from Virginia Tech working to increase the technological and communication capacities of the county of Blacksburg , Virginia . From the early 1990s onwards , they helped expand internet access in the community and introduced a wide range of community related information technology capabilities . They connected and worked closely with the local government to assist in political deliberation within the community and support the formal democratic system [ 77 ] . The Civic Nexus research group from Pennsylvania State University connected with 11 community non - proﬁt groups to help address IT needs through developingself sustaining learning processes . Over the years , they collected a number of case studies investigating the potential of participatory design methodologies for use within not - for - proﬁt and non - governmental groups [ 61 ] The Neighborhood Networks project was conducted in the Lawrenceville neighborhood in Pittsburgh . For the most part , the project was interested in fostering creative expression using technology and robotics within the community . Weekly meetings held in community spaces allowed designers to interact regularly with users and facilitate the creation of a number of technological innovations [ 78 ] . As a whole , these community - based examples do not appear to advocate for any one particular methodol - ogy or set of techniques . Instead they provide reﬂections on long standing partnerships and diverse knowledge gained from experience working in their respective domains through case study . We have follow a similar approach in our design of the eNuk software . Some attention has been paid as well to the relationship between community - based participatory research and participatory design in software development in the work of Ricardio et al . They present the two approaches as philosophically congruent and advocate their continued pairing and investigation together . The foundation of our participatory method was in three week - long trips to the Inuit community of Rigolet to research , co - design and co - develop the eNuk App prototype as well as come to understand and manage its greater socio - technical inﬂuence and impact for the community as a whole . These trips were done from October 2015 - August 2016 with construction of the software prototype occurring in the period of June 10 2016 - August 2016 . Over the course of these visits we had the pleasure of working with the community in a variety of capacities , building and evolving a relationship with its people , organizations , and land . The design process followed four broad phases aligned with the Rigolet trips as well as a three month period devoted to development of the eNuk prototype . While the project is ongoing beyond this thesis , these phases make up the core of our design process thus far and will be augmented , iterated and continued in the future . In the order that they were conducted , the phases were : • Phase 1 - Exploratory investigations and problem setting • Phase 2 - Evaluating initial assumptions and eliciting speciﬁc features / functions • Phase 3 - Software prototype construction ; and • Phase 4 - Prototype evaluation and iteration This speciﬁc four phased model emerged from our individual process requirements including the timing for travel , availability of community - partners , and access to development resources . This conforming of process model to the dependencies of the community accentuated our desire to drive design strictly from the community perspective , modeling the process not oﬀ of a standardized set of instructions but on what ﬁt the community best . Throughout this process a prevailing ethos of designing with the community and not for them grew and was upheld . We sought a deep connection and a immersion in the day to day activities and lived experiences of our community - partners . As outside researchers entering the community , it was paramount that we maintain a position of sensitivity and openness to the community’s perspectives . There were many opportunities to learn from the skilled practices and knowledge in the community . Detailed description of each of the four design phases will be outlined in this chapter looking at the purpose of each phase , their main output / contribution to the overall design , and the tools and techniques that were adopted for each particular use . 2 . 1 Research setting : Rigolet , Nunatsiavut The community of Rigolet is one of ﬁve communities that make up the Nunatsiavut region along the coast of Labrador . Labrador Inuit recognize a fundamental relationship to the land upholding it as integral to community life , health , and wellness [ 79 ] . Predominantly a ﬂy - in community , Rigolet has a population of approximately 300 and is locally managed through the Rigolet Inuit Community Government ( RICG ) and the regional Nunatsiavut Government ( NG ) . Rigolet and the Nunatsiavut region has been a rich and vital 11 hub of collaborative health and environment related research projects especially as they relate to climate change , including mental health and wellbeing and waterborne disease [ 23 , 22 , 79 ] . We were fortunate to be able to build on these relationships and partnerships . Rigolet is comprised of a wide variety of formal and informal organizations , groups and individuals who would be directly and indirectly involved during the design process . Our research intentions potentially cast far reaching inﬂuence in community life and practice . We aimed to work with a wide range of partners in the community to help prevent unintentionally biasing a particular group as well as mitigate concerns of introducing conﬂict in the community . To manage some of the challenges anticipated by our design team , we were able to work with two local research coordinators who were indispensable in communicating and organizing research objectives . Through their expertise , resources , and recommendations we were able to smoothly arrange activities and meet with community - members in a timely manner . There were many other partners involved in the project , both within the community and outside who were instrumental to the eNuk software’s creation as testers , advisors , hosts , technical contacts , and much more . Ultimately our time in the community brought us in contact with members of local businesses , government , health system , school system , and hunters and trappers to name a few . Their contributions to the project can not be overstated . Research with community of Rigolet was conducted under the approval of the Research Ethics Boards of the University of Guelph and the Newfoundland and Labrador Health Research Board . Documentation and acknowledgement of approval are available in Appendix A . 2 . 2 Phase 1 : Exploratory investigations and problem setting Phase 1 of the eNuk software’s design was to establish a foundation for the project with the community and begin exploring the space that we will be collectively designing for . This inaugural trip was held in October of 2015 were we were able to start getting to know the community , its people , and way of life in a week long stay . Three main objectives for this phase were to : • Begin sharing in and becoming immersed in life in Rigolet so that we can better inform the design with the activities and aspects that are most important to the community . • Begin assessing the community’s technological capacity in what kinds of technology would be most appropriate to use for the eNuk software’s design . 12 • Engage publicly with the community to introduce ourselves as well as establish an identity for the project relative to other research being done . 2 . 2 . 1 Cultural Immersion and Observation of Practice There is an incredible diversity of activities being practiced by the community . Interpreting and articulating how they relate , how they are performed , and how they might be inﬂuenced by the software being designed can be diﬃcult without personal experience with them . Over the course of this trip , we had the privilege of sharing in and becoming immersed in some of these facets of community life , participating in work and recreation alike . Many of the activities we were able to participate in were traditionally focused and land - based reﬂecting the strong connection the community shares with their Inuit heritage and the rapid changes they are expe - riencing in the land due to climate change . These types of activities were expressed as important parts of life in Rigolet during discussions with community - members and organically formed the basis for the eNuk software’s design interests . Some examples of these types of activities include , berry picking , hunting and trapping , ﬁshing , and access to personal cabins out on the land . Though scoping the project to land - based and traditional activities was helpful to focus design eﬀorts , what constituted an activity as suﬃciently falling into these categories was often a loose distinction . Many of the activities overlapped in how and why they are performed making formal categorization impractical . The activities chosen to investigate were often more based on interest by the community than whether they fell into a particular category . Informal observations of these practices were continuous throughout the trip , either through hands on experience with the setting or recounted stories from our hosts whom we deferred to considerably as experts in their own lives . The traditional connection to many of these activities are deeply seated in a heritage and cultural upbringing that could not be realistically replicated or artiﬁcially reproduced . This further highlights the beneﬁt of community - led and driven development in order to appropriately represent these facets in design . While it would be foolish to assume that a complete representation of community practice could be gained during this period , a subset of relevant practices did help roughly sketch our design space and build an understanding of the culture in which we could continue building on . 13 2 . 2 . 2 Assessment of technological capacity Additionally , in order to get a better understanding of the technical aspects and requirements of this project we conducted a series of interviews through the lens of present and future tech adoption . Recognizing the varied social and economic positions present in the community we wanted to ensure that any technology under consideration was aﬀordable and available enough that anyone who wished to be a part of the eNuk project could be with minimal barriers . Eﬀectively integrating the eNuk software into the wider existing network of technology and ICT infrastructure would be necessary , ideally building on readily available “oﬀ - the - shelf” resources already present and functioning in the community . A dual purpose review of the present and future capacity for technology was therefore conducted , with the objective of reducing the barriers to adoption and minimize the eﬀort needed while maximizing the impact when integrating the software into existing community practices . Data for this project came from 5 semi - structured interviews and many informal observations made while socializing with community - members in their homes , workplaces and while on the land . Both methods allowed designers to get ﬁrst hand experience with how technology was perceived in our community - partners lives . The goals for this were multi - fold and include the following four objectives : 1 . Identify what kinds of technology are currently being used in households around the community . Most of the prospective users for the eNuk software are expected to come from families and individuals at a household level , who live in and identify with Rigolet as their home . Data gathering using the eNuk software is planned to be done in a distributed and participatory way , making households an important cornerstone for these investigations . Large investments of time , energy , or resources in the early stages of the design may cause resistance so building oﬀ of the existing technologies at this level was thought to be a logical ﬁrst step . Identifying cost eﬀective and easy to use solutions were sought , freeing the community to focus on using the software and not on whether they can use it . 2 . Identify any specialized adopters and their technologies . While broad household analysis was valuable , a subset of individuals and groups with special interests and uses for the software were expected to exist within the community . A more granular breakdown of the community and special - izations can be revealing of interesting technologies , use cases , and requirements outside of the general use patterns of the public . For example , while most within the community may participate regularly in land based activities recreationally , certain groups maintain a more formal relationship with the land for livelihoods , conservation , and / or management . Many of these activities , such as maintaining personal trap lines or designated hunting areas necessitates that some community - members go farther 14 out on the land and go out more frequently than others . Knowing what these activities were and the people who did them can help ﬁll in our understanding of the community and make the app feel more like a part of Rigolet and not a generalized solution . This approach can also be beneﬁcial to help disseminate more specialized technologies into the wider community if appropriate . 3 . Identify unknown uses and tasks that we are unfamiliar with . Along with knowing the varied technologies in use by the community , knowing where and how they were being used was equally important , contextually situating the technologies in meaningful activities and environments . While our community - partners were intimately familiar with their own working conditions and tasks , we needed to become aware of these aspects as they are the environments our software will be used in . While many technologies in the community are mundane and their use similar outside of the community , the prevalence of land - based activities introduces more interesting adoptions for use on the land . 4 . Identify if there are gaps in technology use or adoption that might limit or provide an opening for new technology . These gaps could be notably absent technology or ones that have been maladapted for a particular use . There are two sides to this . On one hand , the lack of technology in a certain practice might be indicative of simply a lack of knowledge on its merits , thus making these situations ripe for innovation or augmentation in this area . On the other hand , an absence of technology could be due to its proven poor functioning for this use or of some social resistance to it that would not be worthwhile to build upon . Being mindful of these nuances helped knowledgeably inform where novel innovations would be most worthwhile and avoid building on technology just because it is already available in the community . All of these investigations ﬁlled in parts of the larger picture , getting a sense of the types and patterns of technologies in use by diﬀerent areas and focuses in the community . 2 . 2 . 3 Open house and public engagement Along with the more direct data gathering objectives outlined above , some activities were held with the intention of engaging and giving back to the community . Since we are working closely with many of its members it was essential to maintain a positive perception of the project and make sure that we reciprocate the knowledge being imparted to us . Part of this was gained through a commitment to transparency and reciprocity in our research objectives and outcomes , clearly communicating our intentions to build trust in not just our process but in the product itself ( the eNuk software ) . This also helped assure that the objectives continued to be appropriately aligned with the community’s by opening opportunities for the public to voice support or criticisms . With an abundance of research projects being conducted in the region , it was helpful 15 to establish a recognizable identity for the eNuk project . Community - members have only so much time and resources to spend and we wanted to minimize the likelyhood of our participants experiencing research “burn out” where the demand for engagment overwhelms the capacity or desire for it . The primary avenue for these objectives came from running two open - houses which were held in a shared community space with public attendance encouraged . These open - houses provided an excellent opportunity to interact with the community as a whole . An inviting atmosphere as well as prize draws provided additional incentives for attendance , with researchers there to guide the event and receive feedback , criticisms , and ideas . Stations were set up for participants to attend and learn about updates on existing related research projects by team members and introduce the eNuk project as part of the broader body of work being done with the community . Establishing this continuity helped allow us to build on existing research relationships and positive awareness along a common theme of climate change adaptation in the area . We wanted the eNuk project to be recognizable and memorable so that people were interested in participating and we could maintain a sustainable base in the community . While this open house session was largely introductory , it would establish a model that was built on in future visits for more direct participant involvement . Another way we sought to engage with the community was through a visit to the local school ( kindergarten to grade 12 ) , where researchers were invited into the classroom to teach basic programming concepts . This school visit allowed us to interact with some of the younger generations in Rigolet as well as share some of our own knowledge with the community . The programming language “Scratch” , a Massachusetts Institute of Technology developed mainly visual language suitable for beginners , was used to ease students into core coding concepts . The youth were a relevant demographic to connect with given their technological literacy and connection to the rest of the community . Working with this group in the future might help to bring information back to their parents and encourage intergenerational propagation of the eNuk software throughout families and generations . 2 . 3 Phase 2 : Evaluating initial assumptions and eliciting functionality Following the initial explorations into our problem space , this phase , conducted on a return trip in February 2016 , involved evaluating how our ongoing understandings held up with the community over time , reaﬃrming and restructuring our direction in light of changes in environmental and community composition . This phase also involved working with community - members to brainstorm their desired features , functionality , and uses for the eNuk Software . 16 A primary output of this phase was in solidifying the software in form and function , reﬁning broad themes into more discrete features in preparation for prototyping . This return trip was scheduled to purposefully coincide with the seasonal winter weather patterns in the region . This seasonal diﬀerence holds not just technical signiﬁcance in navigating design challenges that come with these remote winter conditions but also in the many cultural aspects and land based activities that arise surrounding this period of time . The annual freeze - up cycle of sea and bay ice in the region can naturally be seen to regulate the practice of numerous traditional activities though the formation of a complex network of ice and snow trails . The forming of these trails aﬀects how and why community members go out on the land , introducing and changing a wide range of personal and professional activities such as the hunting , trapping , and ﬁshing of diﬀerent wildlife in diﬀerent areas . This follow up research trip was conducted to experience and investigate the community under these new conditions , bringing in a fresh set of participants and practices while maturing the existing knowledge gained by the team thus far . 2 . 3 . 1 Updating themes and continued immersion The initial themes for the design were revisited during this time , returning to meet existing partners and bringing in new perspectives to widen our community involvement . A second round of semi - structured interviews and meetings helped guide ourselves and community - partners through reﬂecting on the outcomes of the ﬁrst visit and potentially appending them with new insights and knowledge respective of their changing lives and changing environment . Returning during this time allowed us to discuss , observe , and conﬁrm these points all at the same time . These interviews and meetings also worked as a chance to reconnect with members who expressed interest in the eNuk software . A dedicated set of individuals would be needed to extend the design process beyond the exploratory phases so a part of this step was in identifying those willing to invest their time and eﬀort into the process . Continuing our immersion was also important at this time , adding on to our understanding of the community and recognizing that it changes over time . We wanted to experience the changing climate ﬁrst hand both in the regularities of the region but also in the irregularities as they are perceived by the community . Rigolet does not have available weather data for this time period , but three nearby stations in Happy Valley - Goose Bay , Cartwright , and Tukialik Bay , indicate that the area hit an average max of 4 . 46 ◦ C and an average minimum of - 29 . 96 ◦ C from February 11 - 21 , 2016 . Table 2 . 1 shows this data . 17 Temperature ( ◦ C ) Station Max Min Mean Cartwright 9 . 30 - 28 . 30 - 12 . 33 Goose bay 9 . 60 - 32 . 00 - 13 . 93 Tukialik Bay - 5 . 50 - 29 . 60 - 17 . 13 Means 4 . 46 - 29 . 96 - 14 . 43 Table 2 . 1 : Maximum , minimum , and mean temperatures ( ◦ C ) for Tukialik Bay , Happy Valley - Goose bay , and Cartwright weather stations from February , 11 - 21 , 2016 While this short period alone should not be taken as representative of long term trends , the average diﬀerence of 34 . 42 ◦ C stood out and was considered a large ﬂuctuation for that time of year . 2 . 3 . 2 Identifying features An essential take away from the interviews and meetings of this visit , in addition to the general themes , was a ﬁner grain conceptualization of the working features of the app . We wanted to narrow down our design space and start gathering what the community wanted the eNuk software to do speciﬁcally . With some of the knowledge gained in the last trip , we could more intelligently discuss the community - members activities on the land and approach design through this more informed lens . This portion of the interviews followed a largely conversational ﬂow with questions emerging naturally from the back and forth discussion between ourselves and community - partners , building and developing ideas collaboratively . We asked questions ﬁrst surrounding the land - based activities they participate in . This involved guiding participants to reﬂect on their current practices and envision potentially new ways of doing them , asking questions with themes such as : what parts of these land - based activities are important to you ? ; how might you do them diﬀerently if you were able ? ; how would doing them in this way change how you perceive these activities ? ; how might you integrate a new form of technology into these types of activities ? ; what factors prevent you from doing this now ? Answers to these questions helped identify larger trends in how each of the eNuk software’s components ﬁt together and grounded them in the real - world uses . It also helped prime participants to think about what they might want the eNuk software to do and what parts of their activities they would like to change . More speciﬁc questions were asked regarding our community - partners’ ideas for individual features of the eNuk software and their opinions of other’s suggested features . These questions were roughly tailored to individuals , favoring the practices they identiﬁed in the other questions and their known expertise . Ideas were explored actively through this dialog , weighing the beneﬁts and drawbacks of each feature organically over the course of the conversations . 18 2 . 3 . 3 Open - house and public engagement Keeping with the model established in the ﬁrst visit , open - houses were held to get public participation and input on our progress . This was intended to help avoid privileging the decision - making process to a select participant group . The focus was diﬀerent this time , emphasizing concrete decision - making on some of the component features and ﬂow elicited during the individual interviews . Three stations were set up : ( 1 ) land use and emotion mapping , ( 2 ) page ordering , and ( 3 ) technology association . 2 . 3 . 3 . 1 Station 1 : Land use and emotion mapping This station was intended to further understand the breadth of activities conducted on the land as well as their geographical extents outside of the community . Understanding the constraints assisted in making informed decisions surrounding the choice of mapping software , local data sizes and formats , and the detail needed in the map . A secondary and ultimately more inﬂuential aspect came from the direct input of our research coordinator during the process of coming up with this station . Along with the spacial component the participants performed , it was suggested that a parallel emotional component could be worked in , having community - members evaluate not just their activities on the land but their personal emotional attachments to it . This mapping activity was a massive success . It encouraged natural dialog to emerge between community - members as well as the researchers operating the station , and resulted in the unexpected revealing of the emotional component which would become a key feature of the app . A large wall map ( Figure 2 . 1 ) was printed of Rigolet and pinned to the wall of our venue . A set of small paper icons ( Figure 2 . 2 ) were produced , representative of a selection of land - based activities , weather conditions , and emotional states . These icons did not include labels and were largely open to interpretation but were chosen by the research team to be evocative of distinct phenomena . The icons chosen to mark emotional states on the map were taken from the “emoticons” used in the social media platform Facebook , which was popular in the community . These “emoticons” were intended to oﬀer a familiar and consistent option for participants to express themselves . Participants were encouraged during the open house to ap - proach the map and pin the activity markers where they would practice them on the land and the emoticons in relation to them . If their travels took them outside of the bounds of the map , as was the case with many of the more experienced hunters and trappers , this was also noted . The station was operated by one external and one community researcher in order to provide a bal - anced interpretation of the responses and a balanced knowledge set for how to engage participants . With a community - researcher present , building oﬀ of their existing relationships and Inuit knowledge , community members were able to interact and communicate in more depth than if an external researcher focus was 19 Figure 2 . 1 : Map of Rigolet used for Station 1 of the February , 2016 open - houses taken . With the social nature of many land - based activities under evaluation , it was only ﬁtting that these were evaluated in a social setting through dialog with other experienced community - members .

These pages were built from information gathered in past trips , and represented potential options for the eNuk software and conveyed the intentions for the overall system ﬂow ( Figure 2 . 3 ) . Simplifying the design was key as many of our participants will be using the eNuk software while on the land and having immediate access to the content they most needed was desired . This station had a similar eﬀect to a simple paper prototyping session , providing a chance for direct input by community - members on system components . Pairing down the station allowed it to be feasibly performed on a community scale , taking only a couple of seconds to complete .

Using a similar system as our mapping activity , participants were presented a collection of icons representing activities traditionally practiced on the land along with some of the pictures of technologies identiﬁed in the previous visit . Both common household and more specialized devices were represented including : cell phones , laptop and desktop computers , remote controlled quad - copters , satellite phones , walkie - talkies as well as a blank freeform option . Participants were instructed to match the activity marker with the technology they could see themselves using for it , both presently and in the future if it was possible . While some of the tech seemed far - fetched for the scope of the app , this station helped ensure there were hardware choices available for people to have input in , assessed the level of comfort with adopting new technology , and helped in practically choosing the platform for our app . This station also allowed us to design for what the community assumed the eNuk software would be used for , not how we alone imagined it . 21 ( a ) Personal Computer ( b ) Drone ( c ) Mobile GPS ( d ) Mobile Phone ( e ) Satellite Phone ( f ) Tablet Figure 2 . 4 : Images of technology used for station 3 of the February open - house 2 . 4 Phase 3 : Software prototype construction Given the collection of features envisioned by community - members during the previous phase , in - house development of a software prototype was conducted by researchers and assisted remotely by key community - partners . The primary outcome of this phase was in realizing the collection of envisioned details for the app into an accessible software prototype for evaluation in the community . Programming was done over three months at the University of Guelph by two graduate students in computer science . While development was not done in Rigolet , it was grounded in information , instructions , and feedback from previous trips , and regular communication was sustained over the phone or Internet with our community - partners . As functionality was introduced , a concerted eﬀort was made to check this functionality against the recommendations , opinions , and desired direction of our community - partners . In line with our research objective of designing with the community instead of for them , we wanted as much of the testing as possible to be done by community - members themselves , reﬂecting the real - life challenges and uses expected of the software . Balancing the functionality and mutability of our design was therefore challenging , needing to accommodate for rapid development while also creating a complete enough system that can be used by the community without obvious technical bugs . The possibility of potentially 22 sensitive health data being collected with the system also meant paying special attention to the security , privacy and appropriate handling of our testers data as they use the eNuk software in their lives . The prototype was developed to be a minimalistic representation of the themes , features and form iden - tiﬁed in our visits with the intention being to iterate and evaluate progressively in use with our community - testers . The prototype consisted of a combination native iOS mobile application and a public website though which users of it could record , upload and view the environmental observations they make on the land using their mobile devices . This section will provide the process taken when constructing the prototype , our selection of software and hardware tools and some considerations made in preparation for testing and iteration . For a more detailed description of functionality and the prototype’s impacts see chapters 3 and 4 of this thesis . 2 . 4 . 1 Tools selection and implementation decisions There were many considerations in selecting the tools appropriate for the prototype , balancing factors such as functionality , mutability , security , aﬀordability , and ease of use . Additionally a hardware device was needed that could withstand the stresses of land - based activities , operate on limited network connectivity , store multimedia content , and be available and aﬀordable to the community . The four primary areas that are outlined include our choice in : hardware , software framework , data management , and mapping . 2 . 4 . 1 . 1 Hardware Hardware choices for the eNuk software were largely informed by the observations made of the available technologies present in Rigolet households and organizations as well as the environmental constraints of the area . While mobile phone technology proved understandably absent in the community where no cell service is available , comparable devices suitable for oﬄine use appeared quite frequently including personal laptop and tablet computers . From these options iPods touches TM were ultimately chosen , fulﬁlling the requirements as a portable and highly feature rich option . iPod touches TM were available oﬀ - the - shelf and are a popular consumer grade technology that oﬀers a well - known user experience and interaction method ( the mature iOS operating system and standard touchscreen input ) . The built - in camera , speakers and microphone also open up great potential for possible methods of data entry and user interaction . Capable of high quality still photography and video recording , it presents the community with a complete ready to use package and freedom to capture their observations as they choose . 23 These devices are oﬀered in a range of relatively high storage capacities as well , making them ideal selections for handling the multimedia data being captured . From a development side , using such a well known architecture and devices also helped aim towards future compatibility when expanding and developing the eNuk software beyond the prototype . Apple’s App Store service and developer programs provide a clear and reliable development , deployment and maintenance path that future iterations and designers can rely on . As a standard platform it can also be easy to learn and be adopted by community members should more programming tasks be handled within the community . 2 . 4 . 1 . 2 Software framework The decision was made then to have the mobile component of the eNuk software be a native iOS application enabling the full breadth of functionality on the devices and allow its use oﬄine . The Ionic Framework was selected as the development platform of choice . The Ionic framework is an open source , hybrid development framework that allows developers to program native mobile apps using web technologies such as HTML and Javascript languages in a free and easy to learn way . While development is focused on iOS at this time , the Ionic framework is built with cross - platform integration in mind with Ionic apps able to run natively on both iOS and Android operating systems out of the box . 2 . 4 . 1 . 3 Data management Accessing , transmitting , and storing commnuity - member’s observational data with limited Internet access was a notable hurdle during development . While individual households and public buildings ( school , gov - ernment buildings and health buildings ) largely have Internet connections , the reliability and speeds are notoriously poor within the town and non - existent while on the land . Without Internet , multimedia obser - vational data was kept locally on mobile device storage until an Internet connection could be established , at which time it could be uploaded over WiFi to eNuk servers housed at the University of Guelph and stored in a MySQL database . Uploaded data are viewable and editable through a website accessible to registered members . The website was made using standard web development methods . An API layer was created that would allow a standard communication interface between the mobile app , website , and storage server . In the future this API can be expanded and adapted to support the potential for veriﬁed access by external parties and other ways of conﬁguring the data as the project expands . OAuth 2 . 0 authentication strategies were explored for this purpose though a full implementation of this is postponed until further research and testing is conducted . 24 A prospective solution to internet restrictions comes from the use of mesh network topology , a local area network of interconnected distributed node devices , that can be used to connect users through their mobile phones without relying on internet connections . The eNuk team is partnering with RightMesh TM to pursue this technology in Rigolet . 2 . 4 . 1 . 4 Mapping A tiled web based mapping solution was chosen to give community - members the ability to record their location on the land when making observations . This style of mapping technique provides a commonly encountered and familiar interaction method for dynamically viewing geographic areas in variable levels of detail and zoom . It is used by many professional mapping services including Google Maps R (cid:13) , Microsoft c (cid:13) Bing R (cid:13) Maps , and the OpenStreetMap R (cid:13) project where there are readily available software libraries and documentations to assist in implementation . In practice , a map is divided into discrete uniform sections , known as tiles , of a predeﬁned size and shape which can then be sent over the Internet as needed to be reassembled on the client side matching their desired geographic bounds . The caveat in our use case comes from this style being predominantly a web - based technique , typically connecting with a third party tile service provider . Without an internet connection on the land and as a native app special consideration was needed . An oﬄine method of caching these tiles solved this , storing a set amount of them on the device when the app is downloaded and visualizing them using a modiﬁed version of the regular libraries intended for browser deployment . This was possible since the Ionic framework uses compatible web languages but is ultimately not an ideal solution since these libraries are foremost optimized for web browsers and persistent connections . While this suﬃciently solved our requirements at this stage , a more robust solution for handling eNuk’s GIS needs will need to be introduced for sustainable expansion . 2 . 4 . 1 . 5 Hashtags During this trip , the use of hashtags was brought up as a method of categorizing and identifying the obser - vations made using the eNuk software . Discussions emerged during interviews with prominent land - users of how the eNuk software was hoping to account for the diversely interpretable phenomena that the community would be potentially observing while on the land . It was remarked that the perception of what is worth being recorded in the eNuk software would vary widely between community - members , and there was no guarantee that the terminology would be the same . While using predeﬁned categories would be simpler to implement and provide a structured expectation for the formating of data , this method was criticized by 25 community - partners as restrictive and impracticable given the diversity of skill sets , knowledge of the land , and expectations of the app . Questions emerged around who would make these categories and how would they be deﬁned so as to not bias a particular type of observation . With social media being important to both our research team and the community - partners lives , inspira - tion for a more ﬂexible solution came from the social media platform , Twitter , and their use of the hashtag symbol to denote user generated categories . This also served to further democratize elements of the software , this time through allowing the terminology to be participatively generated during regular usage . 2 . 5 Phase 4 : Prototype evaluation and iteration planning Equipped with the software prototype , ﬁve devices preloaded with the software were delivered to a small collection of community testers for evaluation and reﬁnement in use . A primary outcome of this phase was in generating an initial set of reﬁnements for the app and in establishing a method for iterating , re - deploying and expanding the prototype . Five groups made up the community testing team for this phase , a mix of individuals and families who had mostly been involved in the early stages of design . They represented a committed selection of our key community - partners and covered a diversity of our desired user demographics with a mix of genders , ages , and land experience . Participation in testing was voluntary and all community - testers were compensated for their time and eﬀorts . Each community tester brought a new perspective to the design , coming from diﬀerent backgrounds , experience on the land and individual skill sets . We were lucky to be able to work with such a rich collection of people . Follow - up meetings with our community testers were held early in the visit to discuss their initial im - pressions on the prototype and get set up using it . We focused on identifying and assessing issues with functionality , bugs , utility and additional innovations . The iPod touches TM were left with testers for eval - uation while we were in the community and afterwards . Experience with the design varied between testers and required diﬀerent levels of introduction to its workings , and all testers picked it up quickly with little instructions . These community members were run through the software to catch them up on components they may not have been as well versed in . Prompting questions at this point were asked around themes of : 1 . Does this fulﬁll what you were expecting at this stage ? 2 . Do you think you can accomplish the tasks you wanted with the app ? 3 . Is there anything that immediately stands out that you would change ? 26 4 . Is there anything that immediately stands out you like and wish to keep in ? 5 . Is there anything that immediately stands out as surprising ? 6 . Is there anything that you expected but was missing ? 7 . Is there anything that you were not expecting , but is present ? 8 . Overall , do you feel like this was a good direction for the app to go in ? Both our testers and ourselves used the app during this visit to capture observations on the land as much as the prototype would allow , taking pictures , marking locations , and recording descriptive data . Though this initial evaluation period was relatively short , it set the stage for what would become continued iteration . 2 . 5 . 1 Setting up a framework for iteration To support a sustainable evolution of the design , a loose framework was created to facilitate communication and delivery for new versions of the eNuk software from outside the community . A designated technical partner in the community joined the team to be a liason between us and our community - testers . A simple script was created that would , using GIT version control software and a low level iOS app deployment command , allow our technical partner to push iterations of the mobile application directly to the iPod touches . This required community - testers to be physically present in order to make the update as well as limited the deployment to a single computer . These issues , as well as ﬂaws with the script itself ultimately doomed this method and would prompted exploring diﬀerent options . The oﬃcial Apple TestFlight TM platform , a beta testing system used to remotely manage beta software , was chosen to supersede our previous system . Once a change is made in the prototype , the ﬁles can be uploaded to the TestFlight TM system and downloaded directly to our community tester’s devices without needing to deal with low level interactions or have them be physically present . As a well established system recognized and in use by other iOS developers , TestFlight TM provides a tool that would help future developers who may not have been involved in the initial development to learn and deploy versions with ease . While this would help us in these respects , one downside comes from it being restricted to only iOS systems . Cross - platform development will require additional research into platform speciﬁc solutions , though this would largely have been the case regardless . As of the resolution of this part of the research , the TestFight ( TM ) system and prototype software are in the hands of our technical partner and the community testers for active evaluation of the eNuk software . 27 2 . 5 . 2 Community engagement event Instead of an open - house , as had been conducted in the previous two trips , a booth was set up at a local festival that our trip coincided with . The salmon festival , an annual event in Rigolet , is attended by many in the community and was an excellent platform to further connect with the public . Activities were oriented towards fun and giving back to the community rather than explicitly design related objectives . 28 Chapter 3 Design outcomes : results and analysis The results of this case study are mutlifold , a combination of the process , product , and overall design space that grew together through the various forms of engagement and participation with the community of Rigolet . This chapter covers , in no particular order , the evolution of : • The process in the overarching organization of the study through the selection and progression of design activities coordinated with community - partners . • The product in the collection of software programs that were produced as tangible and evaluable realizations of our community - partners’ envisioned capabilities . • The design space in the collective understanding of and experienced social , cultural , environmental , and technical factors that informed , validated and shaped the design decisions over the course of the project . These results present the development of the eNuk app as more than the straight forward production of software , but something that is socially and culturally embedded and speciﬁc to our partners . Combined , these results contribute and inform a future development of a method for software development that is locally - appropriate , culturally - relevant , eﬀective , and feasible for Inuit communities . 3 . 1 Design Process In analyzing the eNuk design process , it was useful to look at it from two complementary angles : through the qualities of our design activities that were context - speciﬁc to our case study and the community , and the design activities framed as more independant and neutral to these context - specifc qualities . 29 3 . 1 . 1 Context speciﬁc lens A high level view of the eNuk’s design process takes the perspective of an evolving story , shared and insepara - ble from the speciﬁc collection of experiences , people , and circumstances involved during design . We sought to engage directly and speciﬁcally with the community of Rigolet , its members , and in topics personally relevant to them . These personal aspects were reﬂected in how the study played out , both in the project’s organization and in the ﬁnal functionality of the software that was produced . Analysis of the process as self - contained in this particular time and place then is both invaluable if not unavoidable . The ‘Design process : methods’ chapter ( Chapter 2 ) chronologically charts the progression of the eNuk app over a time - line of research activities and events that culminated in the delivery of the prototype application . This period was divided into four phases , partitioned primarily along the scheduling of research trips as well as the time spent dedicated to producing the software for the prototype system . These phases roughly represent the major arcs of this shared story , encompassing a wide variety of related activities aligned with a similar intent and occurring around the same time . Reﬂection on some of the important events and activities during these periods is helpful towards under - standing how the community shaped the process , both directly and indirectly , over time and why this was ultimately important for the software that was produced . The three areas that will be focused on are the open - houses and community events , the interviews , and the programming of the prototype . 3 . 1 . 1 . 1 Interviews The personal stories and life experiences shared during the interviews solidiﬁed not just the eNuk software in its functional design , but also our own perceptions of why this research is important . The interviews were revealing of a personal side of climate change that is too often lost in its tendency to be framed as a global scale phenomena . It was important to be able to not just hear and discuss that climate change exists in a factual sense , but also recognize the individual ways in which it manifests in the lives of the community . Interviews were often held in community - members homes and with experienced land - users and holders of traditional knowledge that expressed their changing way of life . These consistently put in perspective the challenges we are approaching through our research and the eNuk software , and gave emotional weight and purpose to the project . 30 3 . 1 . 1 . 2 Open - houses and community events During the eNuk software’s design , the open - houses acted as a kind of milestone for the software’s develop - ment . These were our opportunities to update the community on what was being done on the project and worked to hold the eNuk team accountable for the progress and decisions made in the interim . Familiar faces often appeared at each of our events who were interested in knowing what was done with the information they provided in previous trips , and transparency with the community was key . Another interesting feature of the open - houses was in getting to know the community as a lived in place with history and related rather than independent members . We got to meet with the community as families and friends rather than only as individuals , and learn of heritages and practices passed down by generations and between social groups . These connecting paths deﬁne the community in many ways , and it is in this place that the software is situated . 3 . 1 . 1 . 3 Programming the prototype The programming of the eNuk software prototype can be seen as following from the general structure of the project as a whole . Though this stage was entered into with an idea of what was to be built , there were many unknowns that presented themselves . Transitioning from a concept to a functional application required the same ﬂexibility and adaptability that was striven for throughout the research trips and other design activities . A lightweight programming strategy that organized developers along frequent code deliverables and check - ins with other team and community members . This allowed developers the freedom to change the internal workings of the software as needed to best reﬂect the target vision of the community . The process shared many values with the Agile software development method as identiﬁed by the Agile Manifesto [ 80 ] . These values described in the manifesto are : individuals and interactions over processes and tools ; working software over comprehensive documentation ; customer collaboration over contract negotiation ; and responding to change over following a plan . Reﬂecting on this process , while community - partners were in frequent communication during the pro - totype development and instrumental to co - creating the design itself , further steps can be taken in future development tasks to share programming concepts and development skills with the community so that they can participate more fully in the programming aspects as well . Distance and resource constraints may hinder this endeavor , but the value of further permeating the software’s development with participatory practices may make it worth doing . 31 3 . 1 . 2 Neutral lens The previous focus presented the process as a story , highly context dependent and tied intimately to the personal contributions of the individuals involved in the design . Another view we take on the process looks at the process through a more independent and neutral lens , pulling apart a similar structure in the design activities , and identifying what was important about each of them in general . Overall , each of these activities were aligned along a similar intent , in some way facilitating participation , cooperation , communication , engagement , and interaction with some sort of social or physical phenomena in our design space . How this was accomplished manifested both directly and indirectly through a range of speciﬁc goals , whether they were , for instance , specifying functionality , narrowing down or constraining choices , clarifying , validating , producing software , informing , educating , or observing practice . These goals varied between and were not tied to any particular activity , but could be accomplished through whatever means was appropriate at the time . A useful categorization of our activities is then based on where the focus of the activity was placed , whether they are : individual focused , public focused , experience focused , or software focused . 3 . 1 . 2 . 1 Individual focused activities Individually focused activities are directed at known people or groups within the community and were personalized to them individually . Examples of this include the interviews and visits to the schools which allowed us to target speciﬁc sections of the community in a particular way . These individually focused activities allowed researchers to work on speciﬁc problem areas that were known in some way to be relevant in advancing the design . By focusing on speciﬁc problems and individuals , these activities also ground the design in concrete perspectives and ensure the design is progressing towards real problems as they are expressed by speciﬁc community - partners . This approach involved avoiding overly generalizing or ill - framing the problems so that we were solving real actionable problems that are practical and feasible for our partners . 3 . 1 . 2 . 2 Public focused activities Alternative to the individually focused activities , publicly focused activities were directed at the unknown or previously less engaged portions of the community and our partners . While it was valuable to engage with community - members on a personal basis in order to ensure meaningful results it was also necessary to balance these with activities that broadened the scope of the design through seeking new perspectives . These activities were tailored to engage with the community as a whole and could be used to validate the information gained in the individually focused activities . Publicly focused activities also helped keep the 32 “big picture” of the design in mind and avoid solving problems that were only relevant to a speciﬁc few . The open - houses were the primary activities in this category . 3 . 1 . 2 . 3 Experience Focused Activities While dialog with community - partners can be seen as the central means of engaging during individual and public focused activities , valuable information for the design also came from being a part of the community and experiencing it personally . These activities were evocative of ideas though participating in practices that were meaningful for the community . They were revealing of relevant phenomena that may not have been easy to express verbally or not have an easily deﬁnable structure . These encompass the research trips as a whole and in our travels on the land . 3 . 1 . 2 . 4 Programming focused activities Programming focused activities are concerned with the production and development of the code base for the project . The software produced was a valuable way of engaging with the community in of itself . These activ - ities provide functional , tangible , and interactive realizations of the visions of those involved in the design . Programming activities should be oriented towards producing software that is functional and evaluable by the community and iterative in its approach to incorporating their continued requirements . These activities can be handled by the community through community - developer roles . Holding training sessions on developing and maintaining code , transferring the code base to community owned repositories , discussing and identifying appropriate coding tasks that reﬂect community - developers programming expe - rience , and perhaps transferring organizational roles to community - members are all possible pathways to accomplishing this . Though precise instructions for this would depend on the values , resources , and other factors in the community . 3 . 2 eNuk prototype The prototype eNuk system was the culmination of our own and our community - partners eﬀorts to create an environment and health participatory monitoring system that ﬁts Rigolet . Though some description of this system has been outlined in chapters 1 and 2 , a more complete overview and summary will be given here . As a prototype system , its functionality is currently limited to the core features that best demonstrates the direction and intentions for the system as it could be . With this in mind , considerable further expansion has been envisioned , but incremental development has been central to ensuring appropriate and accurate 33 participation with our community - partners . The prototype was introduced to the community as a proof - of - concept of their involvement in the software design and is actively being tested in preparation for its continued development . The eNuk software prototype has been designed as a native iOS application deployable to 6th generation iPod touches for use while community - members are on the land . This mobile application is paired with a web site component to increase the data’s inﬂuence and user’s capabilities . An overview of the system and its components are given here with a short analysis on how the participatory approach has inﬂuenced and factored into the prototype . 3 . 2 . 1 Feature set and current capabilities The functionality is presented here in ﬁve sections following the current expected path for making obser - vations with the system . These sections are : register , record , upload , share , and learn . Features in these categories are split between the eNuk app and web service as needed , with the app handling the oﬄine recording of observations and the web service responsible for the online sharing , storage , and circulation of them . At a high level , once registered with the eNuk system , users can capture observations through the iPod Touches TM while on the land uploading them to the web service over WiFi where they can share them with others using the web service and / or make them available to health and environment management and research organizations . As of this writing , Register , Record , and Upload components are implemented with the Share and Learn features slated for future versions . 3 . 2 . 1 . 1 Register The decision was made to implement a registration based system for authenticating and validating users and their observations . Fairly standard practice for web based systems , users are required to register for an account before they can gain access to the full capabilities . This registration was done partially out of necessity to avoid fraud or abuse of the system , but also to allow for greater freedom to personalize the user experience and increase the richness of the data being gathered since each user is able to maintain their own collection . Accounts are registered on the website and added to eNuk app while the user is still connected to the internet . Local use of the account does not require internet access . A single iPod touch TM device can have multiple accounts associated to it and a single account can be registered to multiple devices simultaneously . This ﬂexibility accommodated sharing of the iPod touches TM between users and allow families to get the 34 most out of the system for the smallest cost . Each account can be password protected , restricting its access to others using the device or left open for all to use . Having individual accounts in the system helped convey a better sense of personal ownership in users for their observations rather than feeling like they are just contributing to an external anonymous pool of information . Tracking user’s data through the system also becomes easier , which becomes useful for understanding patterns of use and where data is coming from . 3 . 2 . 1 . 2 Capture With proﬁles established , users can use the eNuk app to record environmental observations while on the land . Each observation in the system marks a discrete environmental anomaly or change as perceived by the user themselves . It was important to give users freedom and ﬂexibility to deﬁne the observation as they see ﬁt . Observations are entered using a full screen dynamic map as input , with the users marking their latitude and longitude location by dragging and dropping a marker . Without onboard GPS capabilities or other automatic means , the user must be relied on to manually identify their correct location at this time . The map comes preloaded with the app and currently covers an approximately 350 km square area around Rigolet at 5 levels of zoom . This area was limited by the number of map tiles that could be reliably transferred and cached to the device at the time of development . This is a feature that is expected to expand in the future . With a location identiﬁed , users are simply prompted to enter a title , description of what they experienced , and any pictures captured using the onboard iPod Touch TM camera . Accompanying this information , users can also roughly identify their emotional state or reaction to a particular place , environmental observation , or condition by selecting one of a collection of ﬁve emoticons inspired by social media . At this time , these are not meant to ensure complete coverage of emotional experiences , rather being a testable subset that helps identify their eﬀectiveness . Descriptions of the observations can be further augmented by identifying keywords or phrases by prefacing a section of text with a hashtag symbol ( # ) . Observations can be sorted by these keywords , and oﬀer an additional layer of information for labeling and parsing . In summary , observational data at this time consists of : latitude and longitude , time and date captured , a title , a short description with optional hashtaged keywords , a set of photos , and an emotional marker in the form of a social media emoticon . 3 . 2 . 1 . 3 Upload Once connected to the Internet in town , users can upload their observations to the eNuk servers . Until then , observations are contained in the device’s local storage . User need only press a button to initiate the 35 Figure 3 . 1 : eNuk mobile application create observation form screen upload , removing them from the iPod and sending them to the server for persistent storage . The timing of uploading is left up to the user and does not necessarily need to happen right away , though a concern for the timeliness of the information should naturally incentivize frequent uploads . An automatic system that detects when the device is brought online may be helpful ensure that these uploads are not forgotten and reduce the demand on the users . 3 . 2 . 1 . 4 Share Through the eNuk website , users are planned to be able to optionally share their uploaded observations with others on the site . A tool to improve user enjoyment and engagement , it also puts control of the information in the user’s hands by providing the means to self - disseminate . Users expressed hesitance towards when , how and what information is publicly available so it was important to hold them as their own gatekeepers . The extent and implementation of how this will be accomplished however is in progress as it is not expected to be a straight forward feature . 36 Figure 3 . 2 : eNuk mobile application map screen The social incentives to gather and share information should also not be overlooked here . Many of the land based activities we observed are intrinsically social in nature , being conducted in groups or with the intentional involvement of others in the community . The land is a communal place in many ways , with changes in it likely to aﬀect many people . Changing weather patterns , status of the ice , or hazards for instance have social qualities . Addressing and incorperating these social qualities help make sure we are wholly representing what is needed in the design . Additionally , with the prevalence of social media sites such as Facebook TM the community has become well equipped to interact with the information in this way , and possibly has come to expect it . 3 . 2 . 1 . 5 Learn The observations collected through the eNuk software have the potential to be a rich resource and platform for making environment and health data available to a diverse range of parties . The system provides a means to learn from and better understand the environment and health changes in the community , on the land , and 37 Figure 3 . 3 : eNuk mobile application uploading observations with sample data beyond . If used and designed well the eNuk program can reveal a look into the Inuit perceived environment in semi real - time . There are numerous potential research - partners who are expected to be interested in what this platform has to oﬀer with the possibility for a wide range of additional features being added to accomplish this . First and foremost is the intrinsic value for the data to the individual members and community itself . It is required that the resulting information be meaningful to those who are creating it and who’s knowledge and skills the project is built on . The software is built to be a tool for them to use , rather than a tool to be used on them . Making sure that community - members are engaged means more than just having them continue to collect data , but having them feel like this tool contributes positively in their lives . This should mean that the results and byproducts of this tool are readily accessible to and in a form that is appropriate to the end user . The community should be able to make decisions with the data and have the means to appropriately analyze it . 38 Figure 3 . 4 : eNuk website with sample data Outside the immediate community countless health systems professionals , researchers and government agencies should be able to ﬁnd value in it . The nature of the data and participatory method of collection brings a robust Inuit centric perspective to the data that is not commonly found . A current exciting trajectory for the system is the use of the eNuk software as a platform for disseminating health information , surveys , and policy to communities in a way that they actually want and using data that actually matters to them . Through this , directly engaging with community - members nad linking up in a mutually beneﬁcial partnership . Negotiating this relationship will require considerable additional eﬀorts beyond this study , with further work with health partners and practitioners . This component is in preliminary planning at this time . 3 . 3 Design space During the eNuk software’s design , an awareness and understanding of what it means to develop software for the particular social and physical context and environment present in Rigolet was found to be just as important to develop as the software itself . This understanding was dynamic throughout the project as the perception of what we were designing , and what we were designing for changed over time and between peoples’ personal perspectives . Building up a collective understanding of the important problems , solutions , relevant phenomena , barriers , and motivations for the software’s success together with the community was valuable and inevitable as we shared in experiences . Through this , we are collectively designing the purpose 39 of the project by deﬁning the conceptual space in which the software is situated , drawing from this to make relevant decisions and adapting the software accordingly . In describing the design space for the eNuk project , it is important to note that this does not necessarily represent the personal values and opinions of any one particular community - member at this time , but is our understanding of the important characteristics the software is being built to adapt to . For our purposes here , we can pull out some of factors that were perceived to be motivational in the software’s use and adoption as well as some of what was seen as barriers to this . These factors can help inform continued development of the software . 3 . 3 . 1 Motivators for use and adoption There are three main groups for this , factors for what people saw as being individually motivating , motivating as a community , and motivating about the technology used . 3 . 3 . 1 . 1 Individually motivating factors Individually , community - partners expressed three main motivators for their own use of the eNuk software . They are : to increase activity on the land , connecting with traditional values and practices , and maintain safety and responsible use while on the land . During virtually all design activities , participants expressed interest in the land and the traditional values and practices conducted through it . As a crucial aspect of life in the community , increasing participation in land - based activities was positively regarded and often desired . These activities were regularly attached to feelings of healthy living and connection with their traditional roots . As such participants wanted software that would help them get out more often and do more while on the land both for the beneﬁt of themselves and others in the community . While the speciﬁcs for how this could be done varied between participants , the community appeared largely uniﬁed along this overarching goal . Additionally , and linked with this goal , a more speciﬁc desire was regularly raised by participants who called for not just an increase in activity but also an increase in the safety and responsible conductance of these activities . While going out on the land is highly regarded , the realities and potential dangers of it are also widely recognized . Participants wanted an app that helped them go out on the land and be productive , safe and responsible . Again , this request was found to mean diﬀerent things to diﬀerent people , and was noted to depend on factors including experience on the land , how many and who community - members are traveling with , what activities are being done , and where they were going . 40 3 . 3 . 1 . 2 Communally motivating factors Community - members also showed interest in the use and impacts of eNuk software on the community as a whole . Three main community motivations were noted during our project : encouraging environmental stewardship , facilitating social connections , and increasing Inuit self governance and data independence . Underlying many of the research interactions with the community emerged a theme of collective man - agement and stewardship of the environment . Participants wanted software that would help them enact environmentally supportive actions and initiatives . Participants expressed interest in the idea of integrating social features into the design , either within existing Facebook work - ﬂows or though unique constructs . Social networking sites such as Facebook have experienced considerable adoption in remote Indigenous communities across Canada [ 81 ] . As highly inﬂu - ential and visible platforms , they provide potentially fruitful areas of focus that both ourselves and the community alike can build from . Community - members know how these systems work and what they might be capable of doing providing a direction for creativity . Whatever the implementation , participants wanted software that helps them communicate with others in the community . 3 . 3 . 1 . 3 Technologically motivating factors Certain aspects of the technology were found to inﬂuence user’s perceptions of using the eNuk software . The software needed to be simple and easy to learn , quick and easy to use , and feel like a part of the community in identity and function . The prevailing preference was for a seamless transition of the software into community life and not one thay would need to ﬁt into . With the software being designed to augment existing community practices it was important that it not needlessly introduce additional complexities or over burden the users in their everyday lives . Community - members may not want to make changes in their lives simply because a new tool is available such as the eNuk software . It was important that the software be simple and easy to learn to avoid these issues . Other concerns arose from the practical use of the software while on the land and wanting the focus to stay on the land - based activities while out of town . People were understandably unlikely to stop their travels or activities for very long to record observations , especially during the winter months where prolonged exposure to the cold could be harmful . The introduction of too much technology into these trips was also generally avoided . Participants often perceived time on the land as valuable and worth not distracting . To avoid this , the software again needed to make sure it was unobtrusive to the user , being quick and easy to use in most situations . It had to be responsive to the user’s action and make immediately available the pages 41 and interactive elements most relevant to making the observations right away ( e . g . minimizing hidden pages and nested menus ) , making the most useful parts available to the user as soon as the software is opened . 3 . 3 . 2 Barriers to adoption Attention was paid not only to the factors that might improve the eNuk software , but also on avoiding factors that would hinder it . These barriers arose from both social and environmental circumstances . 3 . 3 . 2 . 1 Social barriers While one of the strengths of the participatory approach is in integrating users in design roles , working with many individuals during development can introduce problems when balancing diﬀering voices in design . This can act as a barrier in the time and resources necessary to expand and tailor the design process towards new community partners . With new perspectives comes increased complexity in the system and the risk of losing track of the overall goal in favor of introducing new features . Limited development resources might become strained keeping up with a quickly expanding vision of the design and be overwhelmed . The monetary and labour costs to develop , deploy , and maintain software projects is another potential barrier to the project’s success . The possible need for monitoring and moderating of the social media content for inappropriate use , secure hosting , housing for the multimedia observational data , and the costs of continuing development are all practical considerations for the project moving forward . A ﬁnal potential barrier will be in resolving complications in ownership and control of the system as the project grows . Coming to appropriate data management solutions that complement the community - led design process will be necessary to overcome moving forward . These social barriers are expected to be especially relevant when considering future expansion outside of Rigolet into the surrounding Nunatsiavut area where many new design environments as well as partners will need to be considered and adapted to . 3 . 3 . 2 . 2 Environmental barriers The Circumpolar North presents a potentially challenging setting for technology development and introduces barriers that must be overcome . The lack of reliable Internet access within the community and while on the land makes uploading and downloading multimedia data an issue . Tailoring networking functionality to this has been necessary thus far and will likely continue to be a concern moving into other similarly remote communities . The internet 42 coverage eﬀects the timeliness and accuracy of data as community - members must wait to upload data potentially days after its creation . The coverage concerns also eﬀect the quantity and quality of data that can be generated through the observations since high quality or large quantities of data may not be reliably transferable . This limited connectivity can cause people to be unlikely to use software if data is lost or corrupted in transfer . The cold weather conditions experienced by the community creates problems when using consumer elec - tronics such as the iPod touches TM currently in use for beta testing . Cold weather drains battery , requires clothing that impedes device handling , damages electronics , and detracts from people wanting to make ob - servations in adverse weather conditions . Since many of the most relevant observations are generated during the winter , we want to make sure that this is handled adequately . Additional to the cold weather , the eNuk software is expected to be used during a variety of land - based activities that expose the hardware to potentially adverse physical conditions . Generally rough usage of the hardware during these activities require the appropriate technology that can hold up under stress . Inadequate technology choices can prevent people from wanting to use the software or else risk the harming themselves or their devices . 43 Chapter 4 Conclusions and discussion Climate change is a multifaceted problem transcending any one discipline . For many populations around the world , such as the Inuit in Canada , climate change is having complex impacts on environment and health that are still being understood . Technological solutions are needed that assist in adapting to and understanding how climate change is aﬀecting these communities . An appropriate community - based development of such technologies is relatively unexplored thus far . In designing the eNuk software , we found our process to be eﬀective for engaging user participation in the design , development and evaluation of a software tool in a remote Inuit community . Through this , we support the further use and exploration of participatory approaches for software development in this domain ( climate change adaptation and Inuit ) and advocate for continued collaboration between software developers , communities , community - based and participatory research initiatives / programs . This thesis has documented the evolution of our particular participatory design process as well as the primary design outcome of a functional software prototype mobile app that was co - created and tested together with the community of Rigolet . The eNuk software can be used by Rigolet community - members to facilitate community - based observation on the land , and in the community . By co - developing this piece of software , we aimed to produce something that was more meaningful and eﬀective than if less user - driven / user - centered approaches were used . This chapter explores the future of the eNuk mobile application , considerations for expansion within Rigolet and outside as well as some of the planned but currently unimplemented features envisioned by our partners . Reﬂections on the state and evolution of our design process and design products are also given in hopes that future development projects can learn from our mistakes and successes . Finally , a focus is given to comparing our particular development approach with other conventional software design paradigms 44 to accentuate some of the strengths of this approach for handling the complexities of designing for this application . 4 . 1 Continued work The current eNuk software design underwent a number of cycles of iteration , but this marks only the beginning of our long - term development plans . There are unimplemented features that have been discussed with the community and necessary enhancements to existing functionality . As well , while Rigolet is the sole focus of the design at this time , there is exciting potential to expand outside the community . 4 . 1 . 1 Within Rigolet Priorities for the design in Rigolet include reﬁning the existing features and responding to the feedback provided by our community - testers . Success especially in these initial rounds of feedback served to direct and verify our continued process . Gaps in functionality fall primarily in the ‘Sharing’ and ‘Learning’ components as discussed in Results 3 . 2 . 1 . 4 and 3 . 2 . 1 . 5 . Addressing this gap will require changes to the API layer , front end , and security that will further need to expand to support beyond our existing tester group and Rigolet in general . An exciting set of design additions under consideration comes from the introduction of elements to further improve engagement and incentivize use of the app . Once base level features are stable , the broader user experience can be focused on , ensuring communiyty - members are satisﬁed and productive . As an example , discussions with participants include suggestions to implement culturally relevant and personalized avatars to increase feelings of individuality , attachment , and self - expression within the app . Anthropomorphic avatar characters , as one option , can have a variety of customization including clothing and accessories chosen by the community that can help make the system feel more a part of peoples lives . These avatars can additionally introduce elements of gamiﬁcation , tying the design themes with functional properties of data gathering . Making observations at certain times or of certain places can give diﬀerent rewards or incentives . This feature can also be used to direct community - members towards a certain directions of interest for consumers of the data ( e . g . if researchers want to learn more about ice conditions speciﬁcally ) , being careful , of course , of cultural appropriation and making sure that these elements are informed and directed by participant’s perspectives . Another planned feature for the future of the eNuk software is to explore mutually beneﬁcial third - party partnerships together with our community - partners in Rigolet . The observational data can be transformed into actionable initiatives in a two - way exchange of information with new partners . Third - parties , through 45 the appropriate channels as determined by the community , can become consumers of the observational data and given a platform for engaging with the community in their own way . The current focus for this is on public health promotion , intervention , delivery , and service . Additionally , though they are less a focus now , we recognize potential beneﬁts for local , regional , and national decision making as well as environmental and wildlife co - management . The eNuk software used as a broader service platform can greatly expand the community’s capabilities . One idea is to implement an online tool to survey the community in a quick and unobtrusive way . This is something that can save considerable time and money on the part of health researchers and ensure the collection of regular and reliable data from a population where this can be diﬃcult . The eNuk software can also be used to promote healthy practices that are informed by community driven data and in ways that the community is a part of . A ﬁnal step is migrating server hosting to Rigolet . We want to ensure that ownership of the data and system is kept with the community ; this means setting up hardware and the software necessary to keep the eNuk software running independent from researcher’s sole control . With the support of the community , the goal is to share responsability for its operation in order to continue its functionality and capacity as the community itself sees ﬁt . Startup and maintenance costs will need to be considered as will recruiting community - members to fulﬁll the practical roles of running the system . Regardless of the challenges , we are conﬁdent in the community’s ability to continue and maintain the eNuk software within Rigolet . 4 . 1 . 2 Within Nunatsiavut The ﬁrst logical place to expand the eNuk system beyond Rigolet is into the other communities in the Nunatsiavut region . Geographically and demographically similar , these communities share many of the same pressures from climate change and could beneﬁt from the eNuk software . Scaling up outside Rigolet however will be met with some challenges . While similar , each community has to be recognized as distinct especially when it comes to developing using the participatory design process . What works in Rigolet may not work the same for others . Con - tinued investigation into the lived experiences and practices for each community and establishing trusting community - based partnerships is the only way to ensure the same degree of understanding that has been met in Rigolet thus far . Data needs will also increase , with more people inputting observations across a wider geographical range . Data management strategies for storing and managing this data will need to be resolved especially if other 46 types of multimedia are introduced ( e . g . video ) . Introducing video capabilities for instance will dramatically increase physical storage and transfer bandwidth to handle . Finding a physical location for housing the data will also become an issue raising the question of who owns what data and how it is distributed and maintained by each community . Centralizing or decentralizing options for control will each have their respective beneﬁts and drawbacks that will need to be considered . Some expected challenges include how to manage : data sharing between communities , data standardization ( e . g . are communities allowed to change what and how things are being collected ) , and control of maintenance and reﬁnements to the system . Despite the challenges that will accompany expansion , it is our belief that the eNuk software can have beneﬁts beyond Rigolet and that communities hold great capacities and abilities to make this transition smooth and equitably beneﬁcial to all parties involved . 4 . 1 . 3 Outside Nunatsiavut Outside of Nunatsiavut , there are possibilities for the eNuk software to be implemented in other Inuit communities and potentially expanding into other Indigenous and non - Indigenous contexts . While this design is planned to always remain an Inuit focused system , climate change and Indigenous health is a pressing world wide issue and similar initiatives can be foreseen to support other communities in data gathering and analysis . The ﬂexibility of the idea and nature of its development can be adapted to incorporate many diﬀerent types of information , though the individual costs and requirements are undetermined at this time . 4 . 2 Reﬂections 4 . 2 . 1 From our participatory design process Community - members ﬁrst and foremost have independent personal and professional lives outside of the project . While our participant’s investment and dedication in the project has been remarkable we are inevitably competing with busy life schedules and commitments . An organizational hurdle in its own respects , this also manifested interestingly in our relationship with them as the end - users of the sysetem and their respective relationships to the project as a whole . This is especially true relative to a business or product oriented setting . Community - based software development was found to be diﬃcult and lack some of the stability in regards to design resources ( access and availability of developers , end users , and partners for example ) that can roughly be assumed in more hierarchically structured organizations . Motivations for participating in the design were also found to be more intrinsically based , such as coming from personal values and practices , rather than extrinsically based such as the generation of business value or monetary 47 proﬁts ( though our participants were fairly compensated for all procedures ) . This eﬀected how a sustainable user base was met in the community , favoring those who showed enthusiasm for the project in general or who are intrinsically connected or eﬀected by the changing environment . We found that it was essential to frequently adapt and be ﬂexible with the design space as we grew in partners and knowledge on the domain , recognizing that it is never quite complete and always open to change . As relatively inexperienced entrants into this setting and given the personal and speciﬁc tasks under evaluation , it would have been impossible for us to have adequately predicted the design direction we ended up on . Essentially we were designing for a user group we had no way of knowing yet . This unknown upfront relationship with the community again painted an interesting picture in contrast to our experiences with previous software development projects . Instead of working from a targeted , discrete , and fairly stable user group , a base line set by these past projects , we found learning of the make up of the community and their values became just as important as the task related aspects themselves . This naturally emphasized a continuous exploratory and iterative building up the design space along with the product itself . For example , as we became introduced to the some of the skilled members and nuances involved in the hunting and gathering traditions in the community , it became obvious that the active / current direction would not be able to accommodate these changes . Approaching the domain with an openness and acceptance to new voices allowed us to broaden and deepen our understandings as we learned and continue to learn from our hosts . Activities in the community were often performed diﬀerently between practitioners . This makes creating one speciﬁc solution that ﬁts them all unlikely , instead favoring consensus and compromise in design decisions . For example , though there are similarities between many of our participants when discussing hunting and trapping activities , there were also clear individual preferences and practice . Satisfying all views would be exceptionally diﬃcult , but coming to equitable and agreeable solutions could mutually beneﬁt parties regardless . Balancing individual and collective visions is important , strongly valuing personal practices and skills but not becoming too tied up in an individual way of doing . 4 . 2 . 2 From our prototype and the technology used The software prototype we produced for this project was intended to be actively used and tested by our participants in practical use situations in their lives . The prototype was also in its very early stages , in the stability of the code and in the amount of features it incorperated . These two positions conﬂicted at times causing some challenges . 48 It was important to balancing the communities perceptions of the design and what is reasonable to implement at a given iteration . An overly polished looking prototype could have mislead the community on our progress , but it needed to be complete enough to be functionally used by our testers . The objective is to understand what people perceive the prototype is for and try to build for that , but clearly communicate these intentions to the testers . Another issue arose from the need to collect real world data but always be ready to heavily rework the design . In order to properly evaluate the design , our community - testers are capturing real data using the app by making observations of real places and events . Through this , the prototype is required to appropriately handle the generation of sensitive data including user account information . Implementing robust security solutions , however , can be time consuming and diﬃcult requiring a certain amount of stability in the system to be present . This is true for other implementation details such as networking , and API management . This challenge can then come in contrast with the necessity of prototypes to be easily changeable and adaptable to the design needs . Managing design time in participatory design projects of this kind , then , was seen be a balance between the stability of the system so that it can comfortably handle testing through real use , and mutability so that the design can grow . Playing too heavily into either side could result in the system being artiﬁcially set in a certain direction locking out further opportunities for user participation or having certain components of the design be open to misuse or not used at all making it diﬃcult for users to evaluate eﬀectively . Again , frequent and timely iteration can be key to managing this , rebalancing and building up as needed . Since the remote distance and time between community visits focused our design eﬀorts to a certain period of time and limiting our iteration time we needed to be especially conscious of this . 4 . 2 . 3 From designing software in Rigolet Overall , we found our approach of community - based participatory software development to be a good ﬁt for use in the speciﬁc context of Rigolet . The use of participative development approaches was chosen in part as an active and conscious measure to avoid perpetuating colonial power dynamics and the imposition of Western inﬂuence on our Indigenous partners during the design of the eNuk software . Working in this context demands an ethical responsibility for research to be sensitive of the ongoing challenges experienced by Indigenous communities as a result of colonialism where a history of mistreatment and marginalization by external parties continues to this day . Inadequate care in these respects can have direct consequences to the community and the quality of research that stem from it , potentially risking harm to community health and wellbeing as well as the generation of 49 poorer research results . Valuing the Indigeneity of our data and research partners is then paramount as is their right to freely determine and develop such data and surrounding processes . We found our approach was a good ﬁt for ensuring the overall success of the resulting software system . Accompanying ethical considerations for using a participative approach for the design of the enuk system , end - user involvement in systems development has long been associated positively with increased general sys - tems success . User - centered and user - oriented models for design have become the norm among many systems designers where participative concepts have proliferated broadly into many aspects of product development lifecycles . Though consensus on this topic has not yet been reached , as a dedicated approach , on a spectrum of ‘end - user involvement’ , participatory design should be seen as falling far into the “user as involved” side of a user involvement spectrum . This has lead us to support its use in our case to help ensure the success of the eNuk software . We also found it was a good ﬁt for the subject matter being incorperated into our design and good for adequately representing the knowledge and skills associated with the context . PD is valuable where established knowledge systems can be complex and design spaces seated ﬁrmly in social and cultural factors that may be diﬃcult to articulate or understand without direct experience . In general this type of diﬃcult to transfer knowledge , often termed tacit knowledge in contrast to formal or codiﬁed knowledge , has been shown to be handled well by PD applications . The activities we encountered in Rigolet could be seen as incorperating this type of knowledge . We also found it to be a good ﬁt when working along with other community - based research in Rigolet . Though our topic may diﬀer from other projects in Rigolet , the community was already familier with the methods of community - based approaches which made it relatively easy to transition participants into the speciﬁcs of the eNuk design process . 4 . 2 . 4 Comparisons across software development models Software development encompasses and embodies a multitude of intersecting approaches , models , and meth - ods that give a variety of options for developers to follow . In developing the eNuk software , we encountered and perceived noteworthy diﬀerences in what we were doing , and the types of software development we had experience with in the past . Our approach to developing the eNuk software has taken on elements of community - based and participatory design ( CBPD ) , through which , we have found success thus far in our goals . Though evaluating this success is ongoing . This section looks at broadly comparing and relating the development of the eNuk software through CBPD with the conventionally non - community based and non - participatory software engineering ( SE ) paradigm . This is done to highlight what we consider important 50 characteristics of our approach , notably by how we conceptualize : the system requirements , the user , the process , and the concept of design relative to non - CBPD . SE , inclusive of its many ﬂavours including agile and the software development life - cycle ( SDLC ) , ap - proach the development of software through an engineering mindset for systematizing processes and problem solving . Though participatory design and community based methods can and are being used in diﬀerent capacities throughout SE , it is our understanding that they are not the norm . [ 69 ] 4 . 2 . 4 . 1 System requirements as dynamic vs structured Typically , the design component of SE ( in the SDLC ﬂavor ) is conceived as its own distinct phase incor - porating the creation of Software Requirements Documents ( SRD ) and other techniques of Requirements Engineering ( RE ) , a ﬁeld of study in its own respects concerned with breaking down and systematically iden - tifying the needs of a particular design space [ 69 ] . These documents are typically built and carried forward through subsequent phases to inform the design though their structure . Our process did not engage in such formal activities to document design requirements , instead maintaining a dynamic model of the software that is negotiable from the perspective of each individual partner’s perspective . This is not to say that a uniﬁed design direction was not needed in order to progress the design in a meaningful way , but that we chose not to explicitly reduce our partners needs into discrete parts within a hierarchy . 4 . 2 . 4 . 2 Users as a consumer vs co - creator How the user is viewed during the project is perhaps one of the most obvious and important distinctions when looking at comparing these general approaches to software development . From a more conventional non - CBPD software development perspective , the user can often be seen as a consumer of the software produced . Software development is something to be done for people , considerate of their needs , but performed by someone with a privileged skill - set . In a more participatory approach to software development , the user is regarded as active members in the software creation . Not only the recipient of software but instrumental to and having shared responsibility in its creation . This relationship to the software is also important when looking at how knowledge is weighted during design . Knowledge of how the software systems should be built in non - CBPD software development is informed by the users but ultimately comes from the software developers . While in a participatory approach , knowledge is more understood as distributed and shared among all parties with the end - user as experts in their own lives . 51 4 . 2 . 4 . 3 Process as prescribed vs participatory From a non - CBPD perspective , the software developers direct the process of creating software , progressing it in a direction in - line with the interests of the developers . In a participatory approach to software design , this process can be seen as more ﬂuid , interactive and directed cooperatively among those involved in design and conforming it more closely to the dynamic interests of the group . 4 . 2 . 4 . 4 Design as rational problem solving vs reﬂective practice The comparison between CBPD and non - CBPD design can be made also in how design is abstractly concep - tualized . In a non - CBPD sense , design is broadly considered as being structured , deliberate and systematic . Software is produced along a set of informed rules that are intended to address a problem that has a per - ceived inevitable solution . In a participatory sense , design can be understood as more dynamic , emergent and reconﬁgurable . Software is produced through reﬂection and action towards achieving change , under - standing the targets and sources of these actions as not static or neutral in nature and inherently susceptible to interpretation and change . 4 . 3 Implications for technology designed in Inuit Nunangat As a whole , the study of information technology ( IT ) and software development in Inuit Nunangat is in its early stages and while participatory design of software systems is starting to appear in community - based contexts in general it is still scarce in Indigenous and Inuit settings up to this point . Despite this , we’ve found our participatory approach to be compatible with the cultural , environmental and research requirements of the area . The high cost for companies to produce infrastructure and IT in remote regions can poorly incentivize developing for these communities where few perceived payoﬀs have left many communities lacking in compar - ison to similar capabilities in the Canadian South . Shifting design and development ownership towards the communities themselves helps alleviate this by putting the means of production in the hands of community - members themselves avoiding the need to wait for external intervention or reluctant partnerships . While there are certainly some projects this will be more suited towards , likely favoring small design initiatives at ﬁrst due to resource requirements and scoping challenges , it may act as companion to balance more traditionally one sided approaches . The sensitive nature of much of the material being discussed , particularly in respect to concepts of colonialism , Inuit self - determination , and climate change all demand respect for the cultural heritage and 52 careful consideration for the multitude of contextual elements interwoven into this domain . These concerns echo beyond Rigolet alone , inescapable parts of future design projects across the Circumpolar North . Other disciplines , notably public health and environmental studies of which we share research objectives , have been trending towards participatory action research methodologies to accommodate these diverse groups . These similar practices however appear to be lagging in the ﬁeld of ICT development . with consequences where Ill - suited development practices can under value the end users focusing attention towards the resolution of a particular problem over the considerations of the human implications . The eNuk software is demonstrative that software design research is ripe to follow in this direction and incorporate participatory approaches into the way software is built with Inuit communities . Our participatory approach helped to broadly capture many overlooked components of the design space painting a holistic picture of the community through the collective voices and skilled practices of its members . 4 . 4 Final Conclusions This chapter has documented some of the lessons learned during the creation of the eNuk software as well as charted the anticipated future of the project as it evolves in continued partnership with our Inuit community - partners . Based on our experience with the eNuk projects , we propose that community - based participatory approaches to software development should continue to be explored with Inuit communities particularly in mobilizing community - based climate change research and adaptation . The co - creation of software with community - partners can be a promising way of producing data and tools that are appropriate , eﬀective , and meaningful from an Inuit perspective . These tools are valuable in that they are owned and controlled by the communities themselves , an important contrast to research projects that are perceived by the community as externally driven or imposed . The evaluation and development of the eNuk software is in progress but we are expecting to ﬁnd this process of community engagement and participatory design to result in at tool that is highly usable and successfully adopted for use by Rigolet community - members . Though we present only a single case study perspective we hope to encourage and inform future software development projects that are Inuit driven and built to help locally manage the impacts of climate change . 53 Bibliography [ 1 ] IPCC , “Summary for Policymakers , ” in Climate Change 2013 : The Physical Science Basis .
