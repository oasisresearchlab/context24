J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Title : Routine testing of close contacts of confirmed COVID - 19 cases – National COVID - 19 Contact Management Programme , Ireland , May to August 2020 . Abstract : Objectives : To inform public health practitioners who are designing , adapting and implementing testing and tracing strategies for COVID - 19 control . Study design : Monitoring and evaluation of a national public health protection programme . Methods : All close contacts of laboratory confirmed cases of COVID - 19 identified between the 19th May and 2nd August were included ; secondary attack rates , and numbers needed to test were estimated . Results : 4 , 586 of 7 , 272 ( 63 % ) close contacts of cases were tested with at least one test . The secondary attack rate in close contacts who were tested was 7 % ( 95 % CI 6 . 3 - 7 . 8 % ) . At the ‘Day 0’ test , 14 . 6 % ( 95 % CI 11 . 6 – 17 . 6 % ) of symptomatic close contacts tested positive compared with 5 . 2 % ( 95 % CI 4 . 4 – 5 . 9 % ) of asymptomatic close contacts . Conclusions : The application of additional symptom based criteria for testing in this high incidence population ( close contacts ) is of limited utility because of the low negative predictive value of absence of symptoms . Keywords : Testing strategy ; asymptomatic close contacts ; COVID - 19 ; coronavirus ; Contact Management Programme ; asymptomatic COVID - 19 . Introduction It is now over six months since an outbreak of a pneumonia of unknown aetiology now named COVID - 19 was first identified in Wuhan city , China in December 2019 1 . By mid - January 2020 the first cases of COVID - 19 had been notified outside of China . The virus rapidly spread across the globe , with the first cases notified in Europe and America by the end of January 2 . The resultant pandemic has caused widespread disruption , morbidity and mortality at a European and global level 3 . Timely and effective testing , isolation of cases , contact tracing and quarantine of contacts are the mainstay of the public health response to control COVID - 19 4 . The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control ( ECDC ) recommend maximising testing efforts , with the offering of timely testing to all symptomatic cases . Consideration of testing of asymptomatic persons such as close contacts of a confirmed case is recommended depending on epidemiological situation and resources . A number of other European countries have strategies which include testing asymptomatic close contacts of cases 5 . A paucity of evidence in this field and a limited understanding of asymptomatic transmission in the community is noted by the ECDC 4 . There is a need to review and share lessons learned from varying testing and tracing strategies given that countries are challenged to mobilise scarce resources in response to a complex and dynamic problem . This paper will communicate the findings from monitoring and evaluation of an intensive testing strategy conducted by a national contact tracing and testing service in a European country . A key feature of this strategy is the routine offering of testing to all close contacts , regardless of symptom status , which enables measurement of secondary attack rates in close contacts . This is shared as a rapid communication to aid design of effective testing strategy to monitor and control J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f COVID - 19 . It will be of use in informing other countries’ approach to contact tracing and testing close contacts . National Contact Management Programme The first case of COVID - 19 notified in Ireland was on 29th February . Contact tracing for infectious disease control is routinely conducted by 8 regional Departments of Public Health with surveillance coordination by a national Health Protection Surveillance Centre ( HPSC ) . Given the scale and speed of the emerging COVID - 19 pandemic internationally , a national Contact Management Programme ( CMP ) was established to undertake high - volume , low - complexity contact tracing in line with ECDC guidance 6 . This enabled field epidemiological expertise in regional Departments of Public Health to focus on high complexity public health management . The CMP became operational on the 13 th March 2020 . The supporting CovidCare Tracker ( CCT ) IT system went live on the 18th March and is used by both CMP and by regional Departments to support contact tracing . It is now used to support all contact tracing for confirmed COVID - 19 cases and close contacts in Ireland . From 19 th May 2020 onwards , all close contacts regardless of symptom status were referred for testing . The CCT represents a comprehensive database of the outcome of testing of all close contacts from that period forward . Methods ‘Day 0’ and ‘Day 7’ Testing Strategy for Close Contacts Since 19 th May 2020 all close contacts of a confirmed case of COVID - 19 in Ireland , whether they have symptoms or not , are referred for a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus - 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) test provided they had not already received a detected result in the past 84 days ( 12 weeks ) 7 . Close contacts are identified according to the ECDC definition 6 . Cases are defined as confirmed cases by the HPSC and ECDC definition 8 , 9 . Close contacts are referred for testing in a community testing centre or a testing at home service . Nasopharyngeal swabs are collected by clinical staff and tested for SARS - CoV - 2 nucleic acid 10 . The CMP refers all close contacts of COVID - 19 cases as soon as possible after being identified as a close contact ( ‘Day 0’ ) . ‘Day 0’ testing is usually performed more than three days following last contact with the case . Close contacts are tested again on the seventh day following their last reported contact with the case if the first test was conducted between 0 and 6 days following last contact . The dates of the ‘Day 7’ test range from 6 to 8 days following last exposure to the case . Where there is ongoing exposure to the case ( e . g . parent of child ) the second test ( Day 7 ) is undertaken on approximately the 21 st day from the onset of symptoms of the index case 11 . Close contacts are presumed to be susceptible to infection if they had not been tested before , or had not tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 before . ‘Day 0’ testing commenced on 19th May . ‘Day 7’ testing commenced on 28th May . Regardless of test result , all close contacts are advised to restrict their movements for 14 days from date of last contact ; or where there is ongoing exposure 28 days from date of onset of symptoms of the index case 7 . Active surveillance is undertaken for this period via a daily SMS , which includes public health advice and contact details should the contact develop symptoms at any point during this period . Should symptoms develop the contact will be referred for a further test . J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f Analysis All close contacts of laboratory confirmed cases of COVID - 19 identified between the 19th May and 2 nd August were included . Data sources used were the CCT , a national appointment management system 12 , and laboratory results from the National Virus Reference Laboratory and regional microbiology laboratories around the country . The secondary attack rate is calculated as the number of cases occurring in susceptible persons within the incubation period following exposure to a primary case divided by the total number of exposed susceptible persons 13 , 14 . In this report two estimates for the secondary attack rate are calculated . The numerator for both is close contacts that tested positive ( SARS - CoV - 2 nucleic acid detected ) at either of 2 tests ( ‘Day 0’ and ‘Day 7’ ) and close contacts who developed symptoms during the 14 day active surveillance period and tested positive . The denominator for the first calculation is the number of close contacts who were tested during the study period with results available at time of analysis . The denominator for the second calculation is all close contacts identified during the study period . This calculation assumes that any close contact identified by the CMP who was not tested would have had a not - detected result . Both estimates assume that the index case is the person that identified the close contact in the case interview and that infections among close contacts are secondary to the index case . Confidence intervals are calculated by the normal approximation binomial method 15 . Results A total of 7 , 272 close contacts were identified between the 19 th May and the 2 nd August . This represents a time after the first peak in the COVID - 19 epidemic curve in Ireland . 1 , 398 ( 19 % ) of these contacts were not referred for testing by the CMP . The reasons for not referring for testing included ; if they tested positive in past 84 days ; were managed off - line by a local Department of Public Health ( e . g . in some outbreak settings ) ; were a simultaneous contact of multiple cases and already undergoing active surveillance and referred for testing ; or had invalid contact information ( with the case unable to provide further detail ) . Of the 5 , 874 ( 81 % ) of close contacts who required further action a test for COVID - 19 was not indicated for 162 ( 3 % ) because they had tested positive in the past 84 days , or were already scheduled for a test as a simultaneous contact of multiple cases . 1 , 126 ( 20 % ) of those offered testing at ‘Day 0’ did not attend their scheduled testing appointment , 4 , 419 ( 77 % ) had results of a test reported and 167 ( 3 % ) were awaiting a test result at the time of analysis . Figure 1 . COVID - 19 , Contact Tracing Outcomes : ‘Day 0’ and ‘Day 7’ Testing , Ireland , 19 th May to 2 nd August ( n = 7 , 272 ) . Note for Figure 1 . Patients required no further action on the CovidCare Tracker in the following instances : tested positive in past 84 days ; managed off - line by Departments of Public Health e . g . in some outbreak settings ; simultaneous contact of multiple cases , already undergoing active surveillance and referred for testing ; invalid contact information provided and case unable to provide further detail . A test may not be indicated if a patient : has tested positive in the past 84 days ; or is already scheduled for a test as a simultaneous contact of multiple cases . Day 7 testing is J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f not indicated if a person : has a positive ‘Day 0’ test or has had a ‘Day 0’ test in last 24 hours . Definitions : ‘Other’ - Test result other than detected or not detected i . e . Invalid , Indeterminate , Inhibitory , Not Tested ; ‘Awaiting Outcome’ – Result not yet received by laboratory or undergoing analysis ; ‘Day x Appointment Attended’ – Appointment marked as attended by electronic appointment system . Attendance at Testing From a preliminary analysis of those of those who did not attend their test , attendance rates are lowest in in the very young , and the elderly . A breakdown of attendance by age group is presented in Table 1 . Table 1 . COVID - 19 , test attendance rates by age group , Ireland , 19 th May to 2 nd August 2020 . Age Group ( Years ) 0 – 9 10 – 19 20 – 29 30 – 39 40 – 49 50 – 59 60 – 69 70 – 79 80 + All Day 0 Tests Attended 68 % 79 % 75 % 77 % 79 % 80 % 84 % 71 % 43 % 80 % Day 7 Tests Attended 44 % 58 % 57 % 55 % 55 % 62 % 67 % 46 % 29 % 58 % Secondary Attack Rate in Close Contacts The secondary attack rate in close contacts who were tested was 7 % ( 95 % CI 6 . 3 – 7 . 8 % ) . The secondary attack rate in all close contacts identified was 4 . 3 % ( 95 % CI 3 . 8 – 4 . 7 % ) . A total of 310 cases were identified from the testing process . 209 of these ( 67 % ) were asymptomatic at the time of referral for testing . ‘Day 0’ Testing At ‘Day 0’ 14 . 6 % ( 95 % CI 11 . 6 – 17 . 6 % ) of symptomatic close contacts tested positive compared with 5 . 2 % ( 95 % CI 4 . 4 – 5 . 9 % ) of asymptomatic close contacts . The positive rate in close contacts tested at ‘Day 0’ was 6 . 5 % ( 95 % CI 5 . 8 – 7 . 2 % ) . The number of close contacts needed to test at ‘Day 0’ to identify 1 case was 15 . At ‘Day 0’ symptomatic close contacts were three times more likely to test positive than asymptomatic close contacts ( OR 3 . 2 , 95 % CI 2 . 4 to 4 . 2 p < 0 . 0001 ) . The number of symptomatic close contacts needed to test at ‘Day 0’ to identify 1 case was 7 ; the number of asymptomatic close contacts needed to test at ‘Day 0’ to identify 1 case was 20 . Table 2 .

There were 2 , 662 close contacts eligible for a ‘Day 7’ test ( i . e . their first test was collected between 0 and 6 days following last contact and their first test did not detect SARS - CoV - 2 ) . Of these 1 , 129 ( 42 % ) did not attend their appointment , 1 , 533 ( 58 % ) attended and a ‘Day 7’ test was performed . 143 ( 9 % ) of those who attended were awaiting a test result at the time of analysis . The positive rate for close contacts tested at ‘Day 7’ was 1 . 6 % ( 95 % CI 0 . 9 - 2 . 2 % ) . The number of close contacts needed to test at ‘Day 7’ to identify 1 case was 63 . The number of symptomatic close contacts needed to test at ‘Day 7’ to identify 1 case was 28 and the number of asymptomatic close contacts needed to test at ‘Day 7’ to identify 1 case was 72 .

The secondary attack rate in close contacts who were tested was 7 % ( 95 % CI 6 . 3 - 7 . 8 % ) . At the ‘Day 0’ test , 14 . 6 % ( 95 % CI 11 . 6 – 17 . 6 % ) of symptomatic close contacts tested positive compared with 5 . 2 % ( 95 % CI 4 . 4 – 5 . 9 % ) of asymptomatic close contacts . The number of close contacts needed to test at ‘Day 0’ to identify 1 case was 15 and the number of close contacts needed to test at ‘Day 7’ to identify 1 case was 63 . The results of this analysis support the continuation of the current testing strategy . In the close contact population the absence of symptoms has a low negative predictive value . The prevalence of J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f asymptomatic carriage is high enough in the close contact population that using symptoms to determine testing strategy is not useful . During the analysed time period the positive rate for all SARS - CoV - 2 nucleic acid tests in Ireland varied between 0 . 5 and 2 % . Any close contact , regardless of symptoms is more likely to become a case of COVID - 19 than the general population . Symptomatic close contacts were three times more likely to test positive for COVID - 19 than asymptomatic close contacts ( OR 3 . 2 , 95 % CI 2 . 4 to 4 . 2 , p < 0 . 0001 ) . However , this report highlights that testing of both symptomatic , and asymptomatic close contacts is important in case finding . 209 ( 67 % ) of the new cases identified were asymptomatic at time of referral for testing . If the threshold for testing had been based on the presence of symptoms in the Irish context ( with asymptomatic close contacts not being tested ) this would have led to a high proportion of the new cases not being identified . The secondary attack rate in close contacts reported in this paper ( 7 % ) sits between a low ( 0 . 45 % ) reported in a study of active surveillance of close contacts from the United States of America ( US ) 13 and a high ( 9 . 7 % ) reported in Shenzhen , China 16 . The symptomatic secondary attack rate of 0 . 45 % ( 95 % CI 0 . 12 - 1 . 6 ) reported in the US study from January and February 2020 likely reflects the lower prevalence of COVID - 19 at that time in the US . This study represents a time in the US before a large number of COVID - 19 cases had been identified , many weeks before the first peak in their epidemic curve in April 2020 17 . Asymptomatic close contacts were not tested in the US study which is also likely to have contributed to the lower reported secondary attack rate . The secondary attack rate in close contacts reported in Shenzhen in January and February 2020 16 is comparable to the results from Ireland . Assuming those with a missing test result were uninfected , they found that the secondary attack rate was 6 . 6 % ( 95 % CI 5 . 4 – 8 . 1 % ) ; with the secondary attack rate increasing to 9 . 7 % ( 95 % CI 7 . 9 – 11 . 8 % ) if those with missing results were removed from the denominator . Conclusion Ireland is continuing its current testing and tracing strategy in relation to close contacts of cases of COVID - 19 . Overall this testing and tracing strategy has proved particularly useful in identifying asymptomatic cases of COVID - 19 . Application of additional symptom based criteria for testing in this high incidence population ( close contacts ) is of limited utility because of the low negative predictive value of absence of symptoms .
