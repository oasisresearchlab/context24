However , there is no 26 simple method to assess the short - range airborne infection risk or identify its governing 27 parameters . We proposed a short - range airborne infection risk assessment model based on the 28 continuum model and two - stage jet model . The effects of ventilation , physical distance and 29 activity intensity on the short - range airborne exposure were studied systematically . The 30 results suggested that increasing physical distance and ventilation reduced short - range 31 airborne exposure and infection risk . However , a diminishing return phenomenon was 32 observed when the ventilation rate or physical distance was beyond a certain threshold . When 33 the infectious quantum concentration was less than 1 quantum / L at the mouth , our newly 34 defined threshold distance and threshold ventilation rate were independent of quantum 35 concentration . We estimated threshold distances of 0 . 59 , 1 . 1 , 1 . 7 and 2 . 6 m for 36 sedentary / passive , light , moderate and intense activities , respectively . At these distances , the 37 threshold ventilation was estimated to be 8 , 20 , 43 , and 83 L / s per person , respectively . The 38 findings show that both physical distancing and adequate ventilation are essential for 39 minimising infection risk , especially in high - intensity activity or densely populated spaces . 40 41 Practical implications : 42 This study provides , for the first time , a simple approach for assessing the infection risk via 43 the short - range airborne route . The minimum requirements for ventilation and physical 44 distance to minimise short - range infection risk were determined for different activities . To 45 help prevent respiratory infections by predominantly short - range airborne transmission , both 46 adequate physical distancing and sufficient ventilation / filtration to remove expired infectious 47 aerosols must be maintained , especially in spaces with high - intensity activity . If a less - than - 48 threshold physical distance is maintained , relying on ventilation dilution alone is not 49 sufficient to prevent infection . 50 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 2 51 Keywords : Short - range airborne transmission , Wells - Riley model , ventilation rate , physical 52 distance , interrupted jet , COVID - 19 53 54 1 . Introduction 55 56 As the coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) pandemic continues , major health authorities , 57 including the World Health Organization ( WHO ) and the US Centers for Disease Control and 58 Prevention , have at least partially recognised the importance of airborne transmission of 59 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) since October 2020 ( WHO , 60 2020 ) and of short - range airborne transmission since late April 2021 ( WHO , 2021 ) . 61 Recognising the short - range airborne route is important for determining appropriate 62 interventions , as wearing N95 masks has become necessary for healthcare workers working 63 in the presence of COVID - 19 patients in healthcare settings and improved building 64 ventilation has become an important infection control measure in the community . Here , we 65 define airborne transmission as exposure to exhaled fine aerosols or droplet nuclei with 66 diameters less than 5  m that contain infectious viruses and eventually lead to infection . 67 Short - range airborne transmission is defined as direct inhalation exposure of a susceptible 68 person , through the mouth or nose , to expired virus - containing droplets or aerosols smaller 69 than 50  m in the expired jet of an infected person . Large droplet transmission has been 70 shown to be insignificant or less important compared to short - range airborne transmission 71 ( Chen et al . , 2020 ) . The concept of airborne transmission traditionally implies long - range 72 airborne transmission . Identifying the presence of a short - range airborne transmission route 73 by health authorities is a major milestone in determining appropriate interventions for 74 respiratory infections . 75 76 The Wells - Riley equation has been widely used to describe the infection risk via the long - 77 range airborne route in indoor spaces . Riley et al . ( 1978 ) presented the first model , assuming 78 fully mixed room air with a uniform distribution of infectious pathogens . At a steady state , 79 the probability of infection 𝑃 is 80 81 𝑃 = 1 − 𝑒 − 𝑛𝑄𝑖𝑝∆𝑡𝑞𝑟 , ( 1 ) 82 83 where n is the number of infectors , 𝑄 𝑖 is the infectious quantum generation rate by one 84 infector ( quanta / min ) , p is the average pulmonary ventilation rate or inhalation rate of a 85 susceptible individual ( m 3 / min ) , ∆𝑡 is the exposure duration ( min ) , and 𝑞 𝑟 is the room 86 ventilation flow rate or strictly speaking , the effective ventilation rate including filtration 87 ( m 3 / min ) . 88 89 The definition of an infectious quantum arises from the need to resolve the challenge of not 90 knowing the number of infectious virus particles . A quantum is defined as the number of 91 virus particles needed to produce a probability of 63 . 2 % ( or exactly , 1 - 1 / e ) of infecting a 92 susceptible individual ( Wells , 1955 ) . Once an outbreak is detected , the infectious quantum 93 generation rate may be determined using Equation ( 1 ) or its variants if the ventilation rate at 94 the time of infection can be determined . A transient version of the equation was derived by 95 Rudnick and Milton ( 2003 ) and others . For cases of non - uniform distribution , Qian et al . 96 ( 2009 ) developed an approach using computational fluid dynamics and the infectious 97 quantum concept . 98 99 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 3 There are at least two challenges in analysing short - range infection risk . First , the infectious 100 quantum generation rates are expected to differ for short - and long - range airborne 101 transmission . Compared with the long - range airborne transmission , the airborne aerosols 102 involved in the short - range airborne route can be larger within the expired jet of any 103 individual , and more viable virus particles may exist in these aerosols expired by an infected 104 individual ( Xie et al . , 2007 ; Gralton et al . , 2011 ) . People are constantly in close contact with 105 others in their daily life ( Zhang et al . , 2020 ) . The exposure duration and physical distance 106 during close contact are difficult to determine . The conventional approach for determining the 107 quantum generation rate for long - range transmission using Equation ( 1 ) cannot be directly 108 applied to short - range transmission . 109 110 Second , the dilution factors in the expired jet zone and in the rest of the room are governed 111 by different mechanisms . The key mechanism for controlling long - range airborne 112 transmission is the dilution by ventilation , filtration and settling , as described by the term 𝑛𝑄 𝑖 𝑞 𝑟 113 in the Wells - Riley equation ( 1 ) . The dilution factor 𝑆 𝑥 for a jet at distance 𝑥 from jet origin 114 may be defined as 𝑆 𝑥 = 𝑄 𝑥 𝑄 0 , i . e . , the ratio of the jet flow rate at distance 𝑥 to the jet flow rate 115 at the jet origin . Alternatively , 𝑆 𝑥 = 𝐶 0 𝐶 𝑥 , which is the ratio of the average concentrations of the 116 infectious quanta at the origin and at distance 𝑥 , can be used to calculate the dilution factor . 117 In general , infectious droplets evaporate , with larger droplets settling , and infectious viruses 118 may be deactivated while traveling in the expired jet . Hence , 𝐶 0 𝐶 𝑥 may not equal 𝑄 𝑥 𝑄 0 . Dilution in 119 the expired jet differs based on whether the surrounding air is clean or polluted . The 120 cleanliness of surrounding air is controlled by room air ventilation ( dilution ) when the source 121 of the pollution is fixed . A continuum model has recently been developed ( Li et al . , 2021 ) , in 122 which short - and long - range airborne exposure are integrated . 123 124 Li et al . ( 2021 ) described a steady expired air jet theory that provides the dilution factor of the 125 expired infectious aerosols in the expired jet as a function of distance . However , the accuracy 126 of such a steady jet model for estimating dilution factors during different expiration activities 127 remains unknown . Expired air flows may be better described as a two - stage jet ( Wei et al . , 128 2017 ) during most respiratory activities ( normal breathing , speaking , coughing , and 129 sneezing ) . Such a two - stage jet consists of a jet - like stage , when an expired jet is released 130 from the source for a finite duration , and a puff - like stage after the source supply is 131 terminated , after which , the cycle repeats . The jet - like stage may be characterised by a 132 starting jet , and the puff - like stage by a puff ( Bourouiba et al . , 2014 ; Wei et al . , 2017 ; 133 Abkarlan et al . , 2020 ) . Fierce et al . ( 2021 ) and Wagner et al . ( 2021 ) utilized a size - dependent 134 aerosol release model with turbulent dispersion to assess aerosol deposition in the nasal 135 cavity and initiate infection . Cortellessa et al . ( 2021 ) investigated short - range transmission 136 risk at proximity using a three - dimensional computational numerical model . Fu et al . ( 2021 ) 137 measured inhalation fraction with different interpersonal distances using thermal manikins to 138 simulate source and susceptible individuals . Bazant et al . ( 2021 ) and Li et al . ( 2022 ) 139 combined a simple steady jet into the short - range airborne plume transmission . Although 140 experimental data exist for the starting jet and puff theories ( Sangras et al . , 2002 ) , to the best 141 of our knowledge , there are no data on the dilution factor of such a two - stage jet , which is 142 essential for estimating the short - range inhalation exposure of expired aerosols . 143 144 In this study , a dilution factor of the two - stage expired jet was derived for the first time . We 145 integrated the continuum model described by Li et al . ( 2021 ) and the newly derived dilution 146 factor formula using the two - stage jet model to estimate short - range airborne exposure . The 147 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 4 term ‘continuum’ recognises the connection between short - and long - range airborne 148 exposure . The new continuum model was used to propose a short - range Wells - Riley model to 149 assess infection risk . 150 151 2 . Methods 152 153 2 . 1 A two - stage jet model for estimating the dilution factor 154 155 We focus on inhalation transmission here . Particles with a diameter of smaller than 50 µ m 156 follow the expired jet streamline ( Chen et al . , 2020 ) . Hence the spatial variation of virus - 157 containing airborne particle concentration can be characterized by the two - stage jet dilution 158 model . We assumed that the mouth opening was a nozzle with a diameter 𝐷 ( m ) ( Figure 1 ) . 159 The expired airflow rate at the mouth of an infected individual for the duration of exhalation 160 is 𝜑𝑄 0 ( m 3 / s or L / s ) , where the exhalation rate 𝑄 0 is the exhaled / inhaled flow rate during a 161 period ( e . g . , a minute or a day ) as defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) 162 ( 2011 ) , rather than during the exhalation period . For a breathing cycle with a period 𝑇 , the 163 exhalation duration is 𝑇 𝑒 , the inhalation duration is 𝑇 − 𝑇 𝑒 , and the coefficient 𝜑 is defined as 164 𝜑 = 𝑇 𝑇 𝑒 . When exhalation and inhalation durations are equal ( Figure 2 ) , 𝜑 = 2 . In the 165 calculations here , a coefficient of 𝜑 = 2 was used . 166 167 The jet flow rate increases to 𝑄 𝑥 ( m 3 / s or L / s ) at a streamwise penetration distance 𝑥 due to 168 entrainment of the surrounding air . We aimed to estimate the jet dilution factor 𝑆 𝑥 = 𝑄 𝑥 𝜑𝑄 0 at 169 any distance 𝑥 . The dilution factor 𝑆 𝑥 in this study is the average dilution factor of the cross - 170 section at distance 𝑥 . Knowledge of the dilution factor allowed us to estimate the short - range 171 exposure of a susceptible individual by direct inhalation of the expired airflows of an infected 172 individual . Dilution occurs due to continuous turbulent entrainment as an expired jet 173 develops . 174 175 For a steady jet originating from a round opening , the dilution factor is 176 177 𝑆 𝑥 = 0 . 32 𝑥 𝐷 , ( 2 ) 178 179 where 𝐷 is the diameter of the mouth opening . Equation ( 2 ) is valid at distances of 𝑥 ≥ 6 . 2𝐷 180 ( Lee and Chu , 2012 ) . For a typical mouth diameter of 20 mm , 𝑥 ≥ 0 . 12 m . Buoyancy , 181 stratification , and cross flows are known to affect the jet dilution factor ( Lee and Chu , 2012 ) . 182 183 An interrupted jet is driven by an intermittent momentum source . Buoyancy forces can also 184 exist but were ignored here for simplicity . A sudden instantaneous release of the momentum 185 produces a puff . In the case of an expired flow , instead of instantaneous release , a release 186 with a finite duration occurs , followed by a short duration of inspiration , after which , the 187 cycle repeats . The inspiration flow has a potential flow pattern , drawing air from all 188 directions . 189 190 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 5 191 192 Figure 1 . Schematic diagram of the expired jet using a two - stage jet model . 193 194 Recall that the steady - jet dilution ratio is obtained using the basic mass and momentum 195 conservation principle , with an additional assumption that the radial penetration distance 196 grows linearly with the streamwise penetration distance ( Lee and Chu , 2012 ) . A similar 197 approach was used here to derive the dilution formula for the interrupted jet . 198 199 We first approximated a realistic inhalation / exhalation profile to a square cycle ( Figure 2b ) . 200 The specification of uniform velocity at the mouth allowed us to use existing jet data 201 ( Sangras et al . , 2002 ) . Jets with an irregular velocity profile ( e . g . , Figure 2a ) have also been 202 studied by Wei et al . ( 2017 ) . For an ideal square breathing cycle , the expired flow velocity is 203 calculated as 𝑢 0 = 𝜑𝑄 0 𝐴 0 , where 𝐴 0 is the mouth opening area . 204 205 206 207 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 6 Figure 2 . Idealised breathing cycles . ( a ) Sinusoidal cycles ; ( b ) square cycles . We considered 208 an ideal 4 - s breathing cycle in this idealised model . 209 210 We assumed calm surrounding air and used the experimental data of Sangras et al . ( 2002 ) and 211 Diez et al . ( 2003 ) , including both starting jets and puffs . The exhalation phase ( t = 0 – 2 s in 212 Figure 2 ) is the jet - like stage , which is dominated by conservation of the momentum flux . 213 After the exhalation phase ( t > 2 s ) , the exhaled flow enters a puff - like stage , which is 214 dominated by conservation of the momentum force . 215 216 At the jet - like stage , the streamwise penetration distance 𝑥 is proportional to the square root 217 of the lapsed time 𝑡 , and the radial penetration distance 𝑟 𝑥 is proportional to the streamwise 218 penetration distance 𝑥 . Note that the radial penetration distance here was not the Gaussian 219 width described by Lee and Chu ( 2012 , page 37 ) , but the visible radii , i . e . , the top - hat width . 220 Including the correction of the jet virtual origin , we have 221 ( 𝑥 + 𝑥 0 ) = 𝛽 𝑥1 ( 𝜑𝑄 0 𝑢 0 ) 1 4 ( 𝑡 + 𝑡 0 ) 1 2 and ( 3 ) 222 223 𝑟 𝑥 = 𝛽 𝑟1 ( 𝑥 + 𝑥 0 ) , ( 4 ) 224 225 where 𝑥 is the streamwise penetration distance of the expired jet geometric centre from the 226 mouth ; 𝑟 𝑥 is the radial penetration distance at distance 𝑥 ; 𝑥 0 is the distance from the virtual 227 origin of the jet - like stage to the mouth ( 𝑥 0 = 𝐷 2𝛽 𝑟1 ) ; and 𝑡 0 is the corresponding virtual time 228 of 𝑥 0 ( 𝑡 0 = √𝜋𝐷 3 8𝜑𝛽 𝑟12 𝛽 𝑥12 𝑄 0 ) . The two empirical parameters 𝛽 𝑟1 and 𝛽 𝑥1 are the radial penetration 229 coefficient and the streamwise penetration coefficient in the jet - like stage , respectively , and 230 𝛽 𝑟1 = 0 . 18 and 𝛽 𝑥1 = 2 . 4 , according to Diez et al . ( 2003 ) . Note that 𝛽 𝑟1 and 𝛽 𝑥1 are not 231 constants for the expired jet tip , but for the expired jet geometric centre or centroid 232 ( Supplementary Information C1 ) . 233 234 Momentum fluxes of the expired jet are 𝑀 0 = 𝜌𝑢 02 𝐴 0 at the mouth and 𝑀 𝑥 = 𝜌𝑢 𝑥2 𝐴 𝑥 at 235 distance 𝑥 in the jet - like stage , where the mouth opening area was calculated as 𝐴 0 = 𝜋𝑟 02 236 and the cross - sectional area of the expired jet was calculated as 𝐴 𝑥 = 𝜋𝑟 𝑥2 . 237 238 Following momentum flux conservation in the jet - like stage ( 𝑀 0 = 𝑀 𝑥 ) , we derived 𝑢 𝑥 𝑢 0 = 𝑟 0 𝑟 𝑥 . 239 240 We then obtained 𝑄 𝑥 𝜑𝑄 0 = 𝑢 𝑥 𝐴 𝑥 𝑢 0 𝐴 0 = 𝑟 𝑥 𝑟 0 ; hence , the dilution factor in the jet - like stage becomes 241 242 𝑆 𝑥 = 𝑄 𝑥 𝜑𝑄 0 = 𝑟 𝑥 𝑟 0 = 𝛽 𝑟1 ( 𝑥 + 𝑥 0 ) 𝑟 0 = 2𝛽 𝑟1 ( 𝑥 + 𝑥 0 ) 𝐷 , ( 5 ) 243 244 as 𝛽 𝑟1 = 0 . 18 , 𝑆 𝑥 = 0 . 36 ( 𝑥 + 𝑥 0 ) 𝐷 . 245 246 Alternatively , by taking the derivative with respect to time in Equation ( 3 ) , we obtained 𝑢 𝑥 , 247 and subsequently , 248 249 𝑢 𝑥 𝑢 0 = √𝜋𝛽 𝑥12 𝑟 0 2 ( 𝑥 + 𝑥 0 ) . ( 6 ) 250 251 The dilution factor in the jet - like stage then becomes 252 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 7 253 𝑆 𝑥 = 𝑢 𝑥 𝐴 𝑥 𝑢 0 𝐴 0 = √𝜋𝛽 𝑥12 𝛽 𝑟12 ( 𝑥 + 𝑥 0 ) 𝐷 = 0 . 33 ( 𝑥 + 𝑥 0 ) 𝐷 . ( 7 ) 254 255 The detailed derivation process is shown in Supplementary Information C2 . 256 257 The transition point 𝑥 ∗ from the jet - like stage to the puff - like stage was determined using 258 Equation ( 3 ) at transition time 𝑡 ∗ ( e . g . , 𝑡 ∗ = 2 s in Figure 2 ) . 259 260 𝑥 ∗ = 𝛽 𝑥1 ( 𝜑𝑄 0 𝑢 0 ) 1 4 ( 𝑡 ∗ + 𝑡 0 ) 1 2 − 𝑥 0 , ( 8 ) 261 262 where 𝑥 ∗ is the streamwise penetration distance at the transition point . The dilution factor 𝑆 𝑥 ∗ 263 at transition point 𝑥 ∗ was estimated using Equation ( 5 ) as 𝑆 𝑥 ∗ = 2𝛽 𝑟1 ( 𝑥 ∗ + 𝑥 0 ) 𝐷 . 264 265 At the puff - like stage , the streamwise penetration distance 𝑥 is proportional to the fourth root 266 of the lapsed time 𝑡 , and the radial penetration distance 𝑟 𝑥 is proportional to the streamwise 267 penetration distance 𝑥 . 268 269 ( 𝑥 + 𝑥 0′ ) = 𝛽 𝑥2 ( 𝑄 𝑣 𝑢 0 ) 1 4 ( 𝑡 + 𝑡 0′ ) 1 4 ( 9 ) 270 271 𝑟 𝑥 = 𝛽 𝑟2 ( 𝑥 + 𝑥 0′ ) ( 10 ) 272 273 𝑥 0′ = 𝛽 𝑟1 𝛽 𝑟2 ( 𝑥 ∗ + 𝑥 0 ) − 𝑥 ∗ ( 11 ) 274 275 𝑡 0′ = 𝛽 𝑟14 𝛽 𝑥14 𝛽 𝑟24 𝛽 𝑥24 𝜑𝑄 0 𝑄 𝑣 ( 𝑡 ∗ + 𝑡 0 ) 2 − 𝑡 ∗ , ( 12 ) 276 277 where 𝑥 0′ is the distance from the virtual origin of the puff - like stage to the mouth ; 𝑡 0′ is the 278 corresponding virtual time of 𝑥 0′ ; 𝛽 𝑟2 and 𝛽 𝑥2 are the radial penetration coefficient and the 279 streamwise penetration coefficient in the puff - like stage , respectively , for the two coefficients , 280 𝛽 𝑟2 = 0 . 2 and 𝛽 𝑥2 = 2 . 2 ( Diez et al . , 2003 ) . Note that 𝛽 𝑟2 and 𝛽 𝑥2 are not constants for the 281 expired jet tip , but for the expired jet geometric centre ( Supplementary Information C1 ) . 𝑄 𝑣 is 282 the expired air volume ( m 3 or L ) during one breathing cycle , i . e . , 𝑄 𝑣 = 𝑇𝑄 0 . For the ideal 283 breathing cycle depicted in Figure 2 , 𝑄 𝑣 = 4𝑄 0 . 284 285 A puff cloud may be best described as an ellipsoid with a radius 𝑟 𝑥 and a height 𝑘𝑟 𝑥 where 𝑘 = 286 9 4𝜋 ( Scorer , 1957 ) . The cloud volume is estimated as 4𝜋 3 𝑘𝑟 𝑥 × 𝑟 𝑥2 = 3𝑟 𝑥3 . 287 288 In the puff - like stage , the dilution factor 𝑆 𝑥 at distance 𝑥 is calculated as the product of the 289 dilution factor 𝑆 𝑥 ∗ at transition point 𝑥 ∗ and the volume ratio of the puff cloud at distance 𝑥 to 290 the puff cloud at distance 𝑥 ∗ , i . e . , 𝑆 𝑥 = ( 𝑄 𝑥∗ 𝜑𝑄 0 ) ( 𝑄 𝑥 𝑄 𝑥∗ ) . 291 292 𝑆 𝑥 = 3𝑟 𝑥3 3𝑟 𝑥∗ 3 𝑆 𝑥 ∗ = ( 𝛽 𝑟2 ( 𝑥 + 𝑥 0′ ) 𝛽 𝑟1 ( 𝑥 ∗ + 𝑥 0 ) ) 3 𝑆 𝑥 ∗ = ( 1 + 𝛽 𝑟2 ( 𝑥−𝑥 ∗ ) 𝛽 𝑟1 ( 𝑥 ∗ + 𝑥 0 ) ) 3 𝑆 𝑥 ∗ ( 13 ) 293 294 The dilution factor in the jet - like stage is , thus , similar to the dilution factor in a steady jet , 295 but the dilution factor in the puff - like stage is different from that in a steady jet . The dilution 296 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 8 factor during the puff - like stage depends on the released volume of air during the exhalation 297 period of one breathing cycle . 298 299 2 . 2 An improved continuum model 300 If the surrounding air is clean , the dilution factor described above can be used directly to 301 evaluate short - range inhalation exposure . In an enclosed environment , aerosols in the 302 surrounding air may be simultaneously entrained into the expired airflows . 303 304 Such an entrainment effect is considered in the continuum model derived by Li et al . ( 2021 ) . 305 This continuum model may be improved using the newly derived dilution factor described 306 above for a two - stage jet . We divided a room space into two zones : the jet zone ( e . g . , 𝑥 ≤ 2 307 m for certain respiratory activities ) and the room zone ( i . e . , the rest of the room ) . The volume 308 of the jet zone ( typically 0 . 15 m 3 for a 2 - m expired jet cone ) is much smaller than the volume 309 of the room zone ( > 30 m 3 ) . 310 311 312 313 Figure 3 . A simple model of the continuum from short - range to long - range inhalation routes . 314 ( a ) A simple jet model assuming the expired jet is steady ( a1 ) or interrupted ( a2 ) ; ( b ) The jet 315 zone with a variable distance x in ( a ) , and the room zone . The jet model may be modelled 316 using the ideal steady jet model of ( a1 ) and the two - stage jet model of ( a2 ) . 317 318 Consider exhaled virus - containing aerosols with an average concentration of 𝐶 0 at the jet 319 origin ( the mouth ) , an average concentration of 𝐶 𝑥 at distance 𝑥 , and an average 320 concentration of 𝐶 𝑟 in the room zone . When the infectious quantum is used , the concentration 321 is measured in quanta / m 3 or quanta / L , the room ventilation rate is 𝑞 𝑟 ( L / s ) , and the ambient 322 ( outdoor ) concentration is zero . 323 324 The steady - state and time - averaged macroscopic mass balance equations for the exhaled 325 virus - containing aerosol concentrations in the room zone and the jet zone , respectively , 326 become 327 328 𝛾𝑄 0 𝐶 0 = 𝑞 𝑒 𝐶 𝑟 and ( 14 ) 329 330 𝑄 0 𝐶 0 + ( 𝑄 0𝑥 − 𝑄 0 ) 𝐶 𝑟 = 𝑄 0𝑥 𝐶 𝑥 , ( 15 ) 331 332 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 9 where 𝑞 𝑒 = 𝑞 𝑟 + 𝑞 𝑠 + 𝑞 𝑓 + 𝑞 𝑑 , 𝑞 𝑠 = 𝐾𝑉 is the equivalent ventilation rate due to particle 333 settling , 𝐾 is the deposition rate ( h - 1 ) ( Supplementary Information B ) , V is the room air 334 volume ( m 3 ) , 𝑞 𝑓 is the equivalent ventilation rate due to filtration , 𝑞 𝑑 is the equivalent 335 ventilation rate due to virus deactivation , and 𝛾 is the fraction of infectious aerosols in 336 suspended aerosols in the expired jet that remain suspended in the room zone . Note that the 337 exhaled flow rate 𝑄 0 during a period ( e . g . , a minute or a day ) as defined by the US EPA 338 ( 2011 ) was used here , not 𝜑𝑄 0 . Correspondingly , the jet flow rate 𝑄 0𝑥 at distance 𝑥 should 339 also be understood as the corresponding jet flow rate when the exhaled flow rate is 𝑄 0 at the 340 mouth . Hence , the dilution factor here is calculated as 𝑆 𝑥 = 𝑄 0𝑥 𝑄 0 . Note that the effects of 341 particle deposition and virus deactivation were not considered in the jet zone in Equation 342 ( 15 ) , but were considered in the room zone in Equation ( 14 ) . 343 344 The size range of suspended aerosols is less in the room zone than in the jet zone due to air 345 speed differences between the two zones ( Xie et al . , 2007 ; Gralton et al . , 2011 ) . Infectious 346 pathogens may also be more likely to survive in the jet region . Differences in both size and 347 survival characteristics suggest 𝛾 < 1 . Although we were interested in the short - range 348 airborne infection risk here , as there is entrained air from the room zone into the expired jet , 349 we needed to assign a value to 𝛾 . However , an accurate determination of the 𝛾 value is not yet 350 available . Using a larger 𝛾 value may over - estimate the long - range exposure . Here , we used 351 𝛾 = 0 . 5 , following Li et al . ( 2021 ) . 352 353 Solving Equations ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) , we obtained 354 355 𝐶 𝑥 = 𝛾 𝑄 0 𝐶 0 𝑞 𝑒 ( 1 − 1 𝑆 𝑥 ) + 1 𝑆 𝑥 𝐶 0 , ( 16 ) 356 357 where the ratio 𝛼 = 𝑄 0 𝑞 𝑒 is the rebreathed fraction ( Rudnick and Milton , 2003 ) . For example , 358 with a typical exhalation rate , 𝑄 0 , of 0 . 1 L / s and a ventilation rate of 10 L / s per person , 𝛼 = 359 𝑄 0 𝑞 = 0 . 1 10 = 0 . 01 . Equation ( 16 ) shows a simple dilution process of both the quantum 360 concentration 𝐶 0 at the mouth and the average room quantum concentration 𝛾 𝑄 0 𝐶 0 𝑞 𝑒 . 361 362 When ventilation is infinite ( 𝑄 0 ≪ 𝑞 𝑒 ) , Equation ( 16 ) can be simplified to : 363 364 𝐶 𝑥 = 1 𝑆 𝑥 𝐶 0 . ( 17 ) 365 366 In the room zone , when 𝑆 𝑥 is infinite , the average concentration at distance 𝑥 becomes 367 368 𝐶 𝑥 = 𝛾 𝑄 0 𝐶 0 𝑞 𝑒 . ( 18 ) 369 370 This reflects the nature of the continuity of exposure to respiratory droplets from a close 371 range to a long range . 372 373 2 . 3 A short - range Wells - Riley equation 374 375 We considered the worst situation in which breathing patterns of the infector and the 376 susceptible individual involved in a conversation are synchronic ( Figure 4 ) . In such a 377 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 10 situation , the susceptible individual is in close proximity , and his / her inhalation occurs at the 378 same time that the exhaled puff arrives . 379 380 381 382 Figure 4 . The assumed worst condition in which a susceptible person inhales exactly when 383 the exhaled air of the infected person arrives at his / her mouth . 384 385 We can directly integrate the newly obtained dilution factors with the quantum concentration 386 equations . 387 388 The short - range Wells - Riley equation for one infector in a room is : 389 390 𝑃 = 1 − 𝑒 − [ 𝛾 𝑄0𝐶0𝑞𝑒 ( 1− 1 𝑆𝑥 ) + 1 𝑆𝑥 𝐶 0 ] 𝑝∆𝑡 . ( 19 ) 391 392 In outdoor situations or when ventilation is infinite , 393 394 𝑃 = 1 − 𝑒 − 1 𝑆𝑥 𝐶 0 𝑝∆𝑡 . ( 20 ) 395 396 The long - range equation for one infector in the room zone is : 397 398 𝑃 = 1 − 𝑒 −𝛾 𝑄0𝑞𝑒 𝐶 0 𝑝∆𝑡 . ( 21 ) 399 400 We assumed that all individuals in a room can be presented by an average person , i . e . , the 401 exhalation rate of the infected individual equals the inhalation rate of the susceptible 402 individual ( 𝑄 0 = 𝑝 ) . The short - and long - range equations can be further simplified , such that 403 Equation ( 19 ) becomes 404 405 𝑃 = 1 − 𝑒 − [ 𝛾 𝐶0𝑞𝑒 ( 1− 1 𝑆𝑥 ) + 𝐶0𝑝𝑆𝑥 ] 𝑝 2 ∆𝑡 . ( 22 ) 406 407 The long - range equation then becomes 408 409 𝑃 = 1 − 𝑒 −𝛾 𝐶0𝑞𝑒 𝑝 2 ∆𝑡 . ( 23 ) 410 411 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 11 The difference between the long - and short - range infection risk can be seen in Equations ( 22 ) 412 and ( 23 ) . When the infection risk is low , we can simplify Equation ( 22 ) by Taylor series 413 expansion to 𝑃 ≈ [ 𝛾 𝐶 0 𝑞 𝑒 ( 1 − 1 𝑆 𝑥 ) + 𝐶 0 𝑝𝑆 𝑥 ] 𝑝 2 ∆𝑡 = 1 𝑆 𝑥 𝐶 0 𝑝∆𝑡 + ( 1 − 1 𝑆 𝑥 ) 𝛾 𝐶 0 𝑞 𝑒 𝑝 2 ∆𝑡 . For this 414 simplified formula , the first term refers to the direct inhalation of the expired air with a 415 concentration of 𝐶 0 , which is now diluted by a factor of 𝑆 𝑥 . The direct inhalation exposure 416 1 𝑆 𝑥 𝐶 0 𝑝∆𝑡 at a close range is approximately proportional to the inhalation / exhalation flow rate 417 𝑝 , although the dilution factor 𝑆 𝑥 is somewhat affected by 𝑝 ( see later discussion of Figure 8 ) . 418 The indirect inhalation ( 1 − 1 𝑆 𝑥 ) 𝛾 𝐶 0 𝑞 𝑒 𝑝 2 ∆𝑡 at a close range is approximately proportional to 419 𝑝 2 . The significance of this re - entrained ‘long - range’ term is determined by the effective 420 ventilation rate 𝑞 𝑒 . The ‘long - range’ exposure , calculated using Equation ( 23 ) , is 421 approximately proportional to 𝑝 2 , as the dilution factor 𝑆 𝑥 is somewhat affected by 𝑝 . 422 423 In theory , we can use the long - range Wells - Riley equation ( 21 ) to determine the long - range 424 quantum generation rate 𝛾𝑄 0 𝐶 0 from long - range exposure data and use the short - range Wells - 425 Riley equation ( 19 ) to determine the short - range quantum generation rate 𝑄 0 𝐶 0 from short - 426 range exposure data if an outbreak existed with data for both short - and long - range airborne 427 transmission . The value of 𝛾 can then be determined . However , complexities arise . The close - 428 contact duration and distance from an infector may differ for different susceptible individuals . 429 The short - range infection risk cannot be simply estimated by dividing the observed number 430 of newly infected individuals in close contact with the infector by the total number of 431 susceptible individuals in close contact with the infector , as the close - contact period and 432 distance may not be the same for all susceptible individuals . Individual exposure periods and 433 distances need to be estimated . To the best of our knowledge , there are no adequate data from 434 previous outbreaks to estimate the 𝛾 value . For example , for the restaurant outbreak of 435 COVID - 19 in Guangzhou , close - contact data are available , but no secondary infections were 436 found to be associated with these close - contact events ( Zhang et al . , 2021 ) . 437 438 From another perspective , if the short - range infection risk is known for a certain distance , 439 activity intensity , close - range exposure duration , and ventilation rate , the short - range 440 infectious quantum concentration can also be determined . However , such data do not exist . 441 The infectious quantum concentration of initial expired air was estimated as 0 . 1 quanta / L 442 using the closest dataset in Chu et al . ( 2020 ) ( see Figure S4 in Supplementary Information 443 D ) , which was further applied in demonstrating short - range airborne exposure risk 444 assessment . 445 446 2 . 4 Activity and breathing mode 447 448 It remains unknown how the number of expired droplets or the virus concentration varies due 449 to different activity intensities . The exhaled droplet generation mechanism is likely 450 mechanical , such as due to shear stress along the respiratory epithelium surface . Thus , we 451 may assume that the number of generated droplets or the viral emission rate increases linearly 452 as the expired flow rate increases . Such an assumption remains to be investigated . We used 453 the exhaled / inhaled flow rate recommended by the US EPA ( 2011 ) . The quantum 454 concentration of exhaled air of the infected individual is assumed to be identical for a 455 particular infector and all activity intensities . 456 457 Table 1 shows that the rebreathed fraction 𝛼 = 𝑄 0 𝑞 varies with different activities , as the 458 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 12 exhalation rate 𝑄 0 changes . When the ventilation rate 𝑞 is kept as a constant at 10 L / s per 459 person , the rebreathed fraction 𝛼 becomes larger for higher - intensity activities . If the 460 rebreathed fraction is kept at a constant value of 0 . 01 , the required ventilation rates also 461 increase for higher - intensity activities . 462 463 Table 1 .

Results 473 474 3 . 1 Development and validation of the expired two - stage jet model 475 476 Each ideal breathing cycle ( Figure 4 ) consists of a 2 - s exhalation phase and a 2 - s inhalation 477 phase . The time - varying streamwise penetration distance of the geometric centre of the 478 expired jet is shown for a light activity in Figure 5 . The forward movement of the expired jet 479 decreased much faster in the puff - like stage than in the jet - like stage . During the 2 - s 480 exhalation phase , the expired flow satisfied the conservation of the momentum flux 481 ( 𝑀 0 ~ 𝜌𝑟 𝑥2 ( 𝑑𝑥 𝑑𝑡 ) 2 ) and the self - preserving growth of the jet ( 𝑟 𝑥 ~ 𝛽 𝑟1 𝑥 ) . These conditions 482 resulted in a relationship between the streamwise penetration distance of the initial jet and 483 time , represented as 𝑥 ~ 𝑡 1 2 . After the 2 - s exhalation phase , the puff cloud satisfied the 484 conservation of the momentum force ( 𝐼 0 ~ 𝜌𝑟 𝑥3 𝑑𝑥 𝑑𝑡 ) and the self - preserving growth of the puff 485 cloud ( 𝑟 𝑥 ~ 𝛽 𝑟2 𝑥 ) , leading to a relationship between the streamwise penetration distance of the 486 puff and time , represented as 𝑥 ~ 𝑡 1 4 . 487 488 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 13 489 490 Figure 5 . The time - varying streamwise penetration distance of the geometric centre of the 491 expired jet estimated using the two - stage model for light activity ( exhalation / inhalation rate , 492 0 . 2 L / s ) . The streamwise penetration distance of the starting jet 𝑥 ~ 𝑡 1 2 and the streamwise 493 penetration distance of the puff 𝑥 ~ 𝑡 1 4 after the 2 - s exhalation phase . 494 495 In our standard two - stage jet model , we used 𝛽 𝑟1 = 0 . 18 , 𝛽 𝑥1 = 2 . 4 , 𝛽 𝑟2 = 0 . 2 , and 𝛽 𝑥2 = 496 2 . 2 , following Sangras et al . ( 2002 ) and Diez et al . ( 2003 ) . As shown in Figure 6 , we 497 compared the predicted and measured streamwise and radial penetration distances for an 498 interrupted jet including three types of exhalation profiles , i . e . , square / pulsation , sinusoidal 499 and real coughing . The measured data included those reported by Diez et al . ( 2003 ) , Wei et al . 500 ( 2017 ) , Agrawal et al . ( 2020 ) , and Behera et al . ( 2021 ) . A reasonable agreement was observed 501 between the predicted and measured data , although differences of streamwise and radial 502 penetration coefficients in three exhalation profiles and different studies exist . 503 504 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 14 505 ( a ) 506 507 ( b ) 508 Figure 6 . Comparison of the measured and predicted streamwise and radial penetration 509 distances for an interrupted jet . ( a ) Streamwise penetration distance as a function of 510 dimensionless time ; ( b ) normalised radial penetration distance as a function of the streamwise 511 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 15 penetration distance . 512 513 Figure 7 shows the idealised puff trains of the expired air flows , using the data presented in 514 Figure 5 . As each train reaches a distance ( a stop ) downstream , the volume of air increases , 515 and the concentration of the discharge at the origin is diluted . Only two complete breathing 516 cycles ( duration of 8 s ) are shown in Figure 7 . The expired air volume reduces as it travels for 517 more than 2 s ( Figure 7b ) . As shown in Figure 7i , the two sequential air volumes are closer at 518 8 s after the first discharge . When these two air volumes are sufficiently close , the two 519 vortices may merge . This is identical to the observed jet - like flow in the numerical simulation 520 for speech presented by Abkarian et al . ( 2020 ) , in which the inhalation duration was 1 s , 521 while the exhalation duration was 3 s . With this simple analysis , it is possible to describe jet - 522 like physics . 523 524 525 526 Figure 7 . An ideal model of the development of expiratory interrupted jet flows for 8 s during 527 light activity ( exhalation / inhalation rate , 0 . 2 L / s ) . The transparent level of yellow and red 528 colours illustrates flow dilution . The jet tip was estimated using Equations ( 3 ) and ( 9 ) . 529 530 531 3 . 2 Comparing estimated dilution factors between the steady jet and two - stage jet 532 models 533 534 As expected , both the steady jet and the two - stage jet models predicted that the dilution factor 535 always increases with an increase in the streamwise penetration distance . The dilution factor 536 of a steady jet increased linearly with the streamwise penetration distance , with a slope that 537 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 16 was independent of activity intensity . The steady - jet - estimated dilution factor was less than 538 the dilution factor predicted by the two - stage jet model ( Figure 8 ) . This is an important 539 observation , as it suggested that the steady - state model used by Li et al . ( 2021 ) is inadequate 540 for describing the dilution factor . An underestimated dilution factor may lead to an 541 overestimation of the threshold distance for minimising infection risk during close contact . 542 543 With the two - stage jet model , the dilution factor also increases linearly with the streamwise 544 penetration distance in the jet - like stage , but in contrast , it increases with the cubic of the 545 streamwise penetration distance in the puff - like stage . The transition point from the jet - like to 546 the puff - like stage increases with increasing expired flow rate at the mouth ( activity 547 intensity ) . The transition points were 0 . 28 m for sedentary / passive activity , 0 . 31 m for 548 standard activity , 0 . 47 m for light activity , 0 . 7 m for moderate activity , and 0 . 99 m for intense 549 activity . A shorter jet - like stage length resulted in greater puff - like dilution factors at any 550 streamwise penetration distance . Hence , the dilution factor at any streamwise penetration 551 distance for the puff - like stage decreases as the activity intensifies . For example , the dilution 552 factors at 2 m are 1 , 928 - fold for sedentary / passive activity , 1 , 520 - fold for standard activity , 553 747 - fold for light activity , 345 - fold for moderate activity , and 171 - fold for intense activity . 554 Moreover , the average dilution ratios of isolated puffs with stroke ratio ( 4𝑄 𝑣 / 𝜋𝐷 3 ) of 70 , 555 121 , 219 , and 537 at distances 25𝐷 to 50𝐷 are 70 , 48 , 45 , and 16 in the experimental data of 556 Ghaem - Maghami and Johari ( 2007 ) . In our study , the injection parameters of standard , light , 557 moderate , and intense activities were 64 , 127 , 273 , and 528 , and the corresponding average 558 dilution factors at 0 . 5 – 1 . 1 m were 116 , 55 , 26 , and 16 , respectively ( Figure 8 ) . Our predicted 559 dilution factors are somewhat in agreement with those reported by Ghaem - Maghami and 560 Johari ( 2007 ) and Behera et al . ( 2021 ) . 561 562 563 564 Figure 8 . The measured and predicted dilution factors vary with the distance from the 565 discharge orifice . Prediction using the steady and two - stage jet models was made with five 566 activity intensities and the discharge orifice as 0 . 02 m . The representative 567 inhalation / exhalation rates listed in Table 1 were used . Note that for the steady jet model , the 568 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 17 dilution factor is 1 when the distance is less than 0 . 12 m . The jet or puff flow in Ghaem - 569 Maghami et al . ( 2007 ) and Behera et al . ( 2021 ) was injected into an isothermal and isobaric 570 chamber . The former was accompanied by a weak co - flow ( a 0 . 5 % of jet velocity ) while the 571 latter had no co - flow . 572 573 To further verify the developed dilution model , we predicted the exposure index 𝐶 𝑥 / 𝐶 𝑟 and 574 compared it with the measured data from the literature ( Figure 9 ) . As our room zone model 575 was based on a fully mixing assumption , we chose only those data with mixing ventilation or 576 with manikin heads in the mixing zone when displacement ventilation was used . In these 577 experiments , one can assume 𝛾 = 1 . A reasonable agreement was observed , suggesting that 578 the developed dilution factor formula and its integration with the continuum model 579 reasonably predicted short - range exposure . 580 581 582 583 Figure 9 . The measured and predicted exposure index 𝐶 𝑥 / 𝐶 𝑟 varies with the distance from 584 source manikin . Prediction using the two - stage jet model was made with three ventilation 585 rates : 30 , 50 , and 70 L / s per person . In the legend , each case is shown with [ # L / s per person , 586 & L / s , $ s ] , in which # refers to the ventilation rate , & refers to the exhalation rate , and 587 $ refers to the breathing duration . The air distribution design was displacement ventilation in 588 the studies by Bjørn & Nielsen ( 2002 ) , Olmedo et al . ( 2012 ) , and Liu et al . ( 2017 ) ; downward 589 ventilation in the studies by Nielsen et al . ( 2007 ) and Olmedo et al . ( 2013 ) ; and mixing 590 ventilation in the study by Cao et al . ( 2014 ) . In data of displacement ventilation , the heads of 591 the source and the target manikins are suspected to be within the upper mixing zone . These 592 measurement data were first summarised by Chen et al . ( 2018 ) . 593 594 3 . 3 Predicted normalised concentrations of the expired aerosols at various distances 595 and activity intensities 596 597 We compared the estimated normalised concentrations of the expired aerosols at any 598 streamwise penetration distance and various ventilation rates using the new two - stage jet 599 model and the steady - state jet model for standard activity ( exhalation rate , 0 . 1 L / s ) in Figure 600 10 . 601 602 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 18 603 604 605 Figure 10 . The predicted normalised concentrations of the expired flow at different distances 606 and ventilation rates of 1 – 10 L / s per person and infinity for standard activity ( exhalation rate , 607 0 . 1 L / s ) . The results of the new two - stage jet model and the steady - state jet model are shown 608 and compared . 609 610 Two major observations can be made . First , the normalised concentration of the expired 611 aerosols predicted by the steady jet model ( thin lines in Figure 10 ) is higher than the 612 corresponding concentration predicted by the two - stage jet model for all conditions ( thick 613 lines in Figure 10 ) . This can be explained by an underestimate of the dilution factor by the 614 steady jet model . In contrast to the steady jet model , the normalised concentration profile 615 predicted by the two - stage jet model was not smooth , with a transition point at approximately 616 0 . 3 m for standard activity with an exhalation rate of 0 . 1 L / s . A ventilation rate less than 5 L / s 617 per person gave a significantly higher concentration than outdoor conditions ( with an infinite 618 ventilation rate as shown by the red dashed curves ) , whereas a ventilation rate higher than 5 619 L / s per person did not . To be safe , we suggest a threshold ventilation rate of 10 L / s per person 620 for standard activity with an exhalation / inhalation rate of 0 . 1 L / s so that the indoor infection 621 risk at a short range is similar to the risk outdoors where the ventilation rate is infinite . This 622 suggestion was also made in our previous study ( Li et al . , 2021 ) . 623 624 The short - range normalised concentration profiles when the exhalation rate changes from 0 . 1 625 L / s are shown in Figure S3 . The short - range normalised concentrations are determined by the 626 exhalation rate , ventilation rate , and dilution factor . Unlike the steady jet model , the dilution 627 factor estimated by the two - stage jet model depends on the exhalation rate of the infector . A 628 higher activity intensity results in a lower dilution factor in the puff - region ( Figure 8 ) . 629 Simultaneously , a higher activity intensity results in a greater rebreathed fraction ( 𝛼 = 𝑄 0 𝑞 𝑒 ) if 630 the ventilation rates are kept constant . Thus , a higher short - range normalised concentration , 631 ( 𝛾 𝑄 0 𝑞 𝑒 ( 1 − 1 𝑆 𝑥 ) + 1 𝑆 𝑥 ) , is predicted for heavier activities than for standard activities if the 632 ventilation rates are kept constant ( Figure S3 ) . 633 634 635 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 19 3 . 4 Infection risk via the short - range airborne route using the two - stage jet model 636 637 The short - range airborne infection risk was estimated using a quantum concentration of 0 . 1 638 quantum / L and an exposure duration of 42 s as an example . Figure 11 shows the predicted 639 profiles of the short - range airborne infection risk for standard activity ( inhalation rate , 0 . 1 640 L / s ) . The data clearly show that a ventilation rate less than 5 L / s per person introduces a 641 significantly higher infection risk than outdoor conditions . This conclusion is consistent with 642 the exposure estimates presented in Figure 10 . 643 644 We examined whether it was possible to estimate a threshold distance and threshold 645 ventilation rate when the quantum concentration at the mouth was unknown . Answering this 646 question is complicated by two factors , namely , the distance and ventilation rate , which 647 jointly affect the short - range airborne infection risk . When we evaluated the partial derivative 648 𝜕𝑃 𝜕𝑥 as a function of distance , the curves for different ventilation rates collapsed into almost 649 one curve . We attempted to identify a relatively flat region by determining when 𝜕𝑃 𝜕𝑥 has a 650 small value . Outdoor infection risk is known to be low at a typical close - contact distance , 651 which is approximately 0 . 7 m . At 𝑥 = 0 . 7 m , we found that 𝜕𝑃 𝜕𝑥 = −0 . 2 % , which may be 652 located in a relatively flat region of the curve ( Figure 11a ) . This corresponds to an infection 653 risk of 0 . 82 % for a ventilation rate of 10 L / s per person . At 𝑥 = 0 . 7 m and 𝑞 𝑒 = 10 L / s per 654 person , we also found that 𝜕𝑃 𝜕𝑞 𝑒 = −0 . 02 % , which may also be located in a relatively flat 655 region of the curve ( Figure 11b ) . Thus , we determined a threshold distance of 0 . 7 m and a 656 threshold ventilation rate of 10 L / s per person for standard activity ( inhalation rate , 0 . 1 L / s ) . 657 Further , two parameters , namely , 𝜕𝑃 𝜕𝑥 = −0 . 2 % with an infinite ventilation rate and 𝜕𝑃 𝜕𝑞 𝑒 = 658 −0 . 02 % at the corresponding threshold distance , were regarded as the benchmarks for 659 determining the threshold distance and threshold ventilation rates for other activities . 660 661 662 ( a ) 663 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 20 664 ( b ) 665 Figure 11 . Estimated short - range airborne infection risk varies with distance and ventilation 666 rate , and the partial derivatives of infection risk against distance and ventilation rate . ( a ) 667 Estimated short - range airborne infection risk , 𝑃 , as a function of the distances and ventilation 668 rates for standard activity ( infectious quantum concentration , 0 . 1 quanta / L and exposure time , 669 42 s , assuming a 2 - hour total exposure period with four close - contact events per hour and 5 . 4 670 s / per close - contact event ) . In the inserted figure , the partial derivative of infection risk is 671 shown against distance 𝜕𝑃 𝜕𝑥 . ( b ) The estimated short - range airborne infection risk 𝑃 at 672 threshold distance 𝑥 = 0 . 7 m and , in the inset figure , the partial derivative of infection risk 673 against the ventilation rate 𝜕𝑃 𝜕𝑞 𝑒 are shown . 674 675 We further estimated the short - range infection risk for different activity intensities using the 676 infectious quantum concentration of 0 . 1 quanta / L and exposure time of 42 s as an example 677 ( Figure S6 ) . In all settings , we determined the threshold distance for 𝜕𝑃 𝜕𝑥 = −0 . 2 % with an 678 infinite ventilation rate . The threshold distance was then found to be 0 . 59 m for 679 sedentary / passive activity , 1 . 1 m for light activity , 1 . 7 m for moderate activity , and 2 . 6 m for 680 intense activity . Once a threshold distance was found , the corresponding threshold ventilation 681 rate was determined using 𝜕𝑃 𝜕𝑞 𝑒 = −0 . 02 % at the corresponding threshold distance . The 682 threshold ventilation rate was 8 L / s per person for sedentary activity , 20 L / s per person for 683 light activity , 43 L / s per person for moderate activity , and 83 L / s per person for intense 684 activity ( Figure 12 ) . It was clear that the threshold ventilation rate that we identified was 685 proportional to the inhalation rate . The partial derivative approach predicted a threshold 686 ventilation rate that was identical to the ventilation rate that gives a constant rebreathed 687 fraction of 0 . 01 ( Table 1 ) . 688 689 Note that the partial derivative method we used to determine the threshold distance and 690 threshold ventilation rate did not lead to a constant infection risk under threshold conditions . 691 The risk of infection under threshold conditions was 0 . 79 % for sedentary / passive activity , 692 0 . 82 % for standard activity ( inhalation rate , 0 . 1 L / s ) , 1 . 14 % for light activity , 1 . 74 % for 693 moderate activity , and 2 . 61 % for intense activity . The explanation for this finding is that the 694 obtained threshold ventilation rates for all activity intensities led to a constant rebreathed 695 fraction , 𝛼 , of 0 . 01 , i . e . , the concentration of the expired aerosols was the same after dilution . 696 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 21 When the infection risk is low , Equation ( 20 ) can be simplified by Taylor series expansion to 697 𝑃 ≈ 1 𝑆 𝑥 𝐶 0 𝑝∆𝑡 + ( 1 − 1 𝑆 𝑥 ) 𝛾 𝐶 0 𝑞 𝑒 𝑝 2 ∆𝑡 = ( 𝛾𝛼 + 1−𝛾𝛼 𝑆 𝑥 ) 𝐶 0 𝑝∆𝑡 . From this simplified formula , the 698 short - range airborne infection risk is approximately proportional to the inhalation volume 699 𝑝∆𝑡 if ventilation rates for different activity intensities are kept at threshold ventilation rates 700 ( i . e . , a constant rebreathed fraction , 𝛼 ) . However , higher - intensity activity had a larger 701 dilution factor at the corresponding threshold distance , i . e . , 54 - fold at 0 . 59 m for 702 sedentary / passive activity , 69 - fold at 0 . 7 m for standard activity , 115 - fold at 1 . 1 m for light 703 activity , 211 - fold at 1 . 7 m for moderate activity , and 383 - fold at 2 . 6 m for intense activity . 704 This led to a decrease in short - range exposure for higher - intensity activity at the threshold 705 distance and ventilation rate compared to the proportional relationship with the inhalation 706 volume 𝑝∆𝑡 . In contrast , the long - range exposure was proportional to the inhalation volume 707 𝑝∆𝑡 at the threshold ventilation rate . 708 709 710 711 Figure 12 .

Discussion 718 719 4 . 1 A new short - range Wells - Riley model with challenges 720 721 Our study is the first to present a dilution factor formula for a two - stage jet , and our estimated 722 dilution factor was in reasonable agreement with measured or simulated data from the 723 literature ( Figure 8 ) . The dilution factor formula was further confirmed by comparing the 724 predicted short - range exposure with measured data from the literature ( Figure 9 ) . To the best 725 of our knowledge , such a formula has not previously been reported , but it is required to assess 726 the short - range exposure and infection risk of respiratory infections . The traditional steady jet 727 model ( Li et al . , 2021 ) does not consider the effect of respiratory activity on the dilution 728 factor . In the steady jet model , the dilution factor is not a function of activity intensity , but is 729 constant , and the predicted dilution factors are 8 , 16 , and 32 at distances of 0 . 5 , 1 , and 2 m , 730 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 22 respectively . The two - stage jet model predicted a dilution factor that depends on activity 731 intensity ( exhalation rate , Figure 8 ) . For light activity , the predicted dilution factors were 12 , 732 94 , and 748 at distances of 0 . 5 , 1 , and 2 m , respectively ( Figure 5 ) . The dilution factors for 733 intense activity were smaller than those for light activity , but still significantly higher than 734 those predicted by the steady jet model . For the rest scenarios , the dilution factor predicted in 735 the puff - like stage at 2 m was up to 79 times higher with the two - stage jet model than with 736 the steady jet model . 737 738 Using an existing continuum model of short - and long - range airborne transmission of SARS - 739 CoV - 2 ( Li et al . , 2021 ) , we derived a new , simple short - range Wells - Riley model . This model 740 promises to provide a simple formula for the estimation of infection risk without wearing a 741 mask based on physical distance , activity intensity , and ventilation rate . Our short - range 742 Wells - Riley model is based on the single - hit assumption , which can be further expanded to a 743 general short - range dose - response model using the multiple - hit assumption if the minimum 744 infection dose is known ( Haas , 1983 ; Sze To and Chao , 2010 ) . Wearing a mask by infector 745 decreases expired virus - containing aerosol concentration ( 𝐶 0 ) at mouth . Wearing a mask by 746 the susceptible individual reduces the inhaled aerosols . Mask wearing also changes the jet 747 geometry and reduce the streamwise penetration distance and short - range airborne exposure 748 risk . Hence , wearing a mask is one of the most important strategies to reducing short - range 749 inhalation exposure ( Wagner et al . , 2021 ; Fierce et al . , 2021 ) . ” 750 751 Most SARS - CoV - 2 infections have occurred indoors ( Qian et al . , 2020 ) . The original 752 continuum model described by Li et al . ( 2021 ) aimed to explain the low outdoor infection 753 risk phenomenon . The revised continuum model using the new dilution factor also explained 754 the low outdoor infection risk phenomenon , as the ventilation rate may be assumed to be 755 infinite outdoors ( Figure 10 and Figure 11 ) . The new continuum model predicted a more 756 dramatic decrease in infection risk as the distance changed from 0 . 5 m to 1 m , while the 757 steady jet model predicted a smoother profile of the normalised concentration ( Figure 10 ) . 758 759 The new model predictions suggest that the short - range infection risk with intense activity is 760 significantly high when the ventilation rate and physical distance requirements cannot be 761 satisfied . This is expected , as high infection rates have been observed in gyms , fitness 762 centres , and dance floors during the on - going COVID - 19 pandemic . Our new model 763 predicted that outdoor infection may also occur with intense activity at close range , such as 764 during sports activities or heavy labour . The data suggested that for light activities , the 765 outdoor infection risk due to short - range inhalation was low ; however , during intense activity , 766 short - range inhalation transmission is possible . This has implications for intervention 767 measures at outdoor events . The observed high infection risk among Hong Kong construction 768 workers may support this observation , although their lounge room was also poorly ventilated 769 ( Low et al . , 2020 ; GCR Staff , 2021 ) , such that infection may have occurred indoors . A greater 770 physical distance of 2 . 6 m is required for people engaging in intense activities outdoors . 771 However , for indoor settings , even at this distance , a minimum ventilation rate of 83 L / s per 772 person is needed according to our simple model . 773 774 Various approaches have been used to determine the threshold physical distance for infection 775 control ( Liu et al . , 2021 ) . Different countries have also adopted different physical distances 776 from 1 to 2 m ( Shulman , 2020 ) . Our data support the use of a threshold distance of 1 m for 777 light activities in the presence of sufficient ventilation , but a higher threshold distance for 778 higher - intensity activities . A much higher ventilation rate is also needed to reduce the short - 779 range airborne infection risk associated with high - intensity activities . 780 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 23 781 Different close - contact distances between people are chosen for various social purposes . The 782 average distance between people is approximately 0 . 7 m . One commonly cited , but informal , 783 explanation for keeping a minimum distance is to avoid body odour or expired gas odour 784 from other people . The provision of sufficient ventilation is also known to minimise body 785 odour . If this is correct , then the commonly used minimum ventilation standard of 10 L / s per 786 person is sufficient . At a standard activity intensity , with an exhalation flow rate of 0 . 1 L / s , a 787 ventilation rate of 10 L / s per person results in a 100 - fold dilution for the room average odour 788 concentration . Thus , a dilution of 100 - fold may lead to sufficient dilution of expired air to 789 avoid odour problems . In the steady jet model , the normalised concentration was estimated to 790 be 0 . 03 , or a dilution of only 33 - fold , at a physical distance of 2 m in outdoor conditions . If a 791 100 - fold dilution is required to avoid body odour , and body odour can be avoided at a 792 standard distance of 0 . 7 m , then the estimate by the steady jet model is markedly out of scale . 793 This is expected , as a realistic expired jet is not a steady jet . In contrast , the two - stage jet 794 model offers a reasonable prediction . To achieve a 100 - fold dilution or a normalised 795 concentration of 0 . 01 , the estimated physical distance was 0 . 73 m for sedentary / passive 796 activity , 0 . 8 m for standard activity , 1 . 02 m for light activity , 1 . 33 m for moderate activity , 797 and 1 . 68 m for intense activity . The predicted distance of 0 . 8 m is relatively close to the 0 . 7 m 798 predicted for standard activity , suggesting that the two - stage jet model dilution formula offers 799 a reasonable prediction of the expired jet dilution . 800 801 One striking observation with the two - stage jet model was that increasing ventilation was 802 much less effective at reducing short - range airborne infection risk than increasing physical 803 distance , when the physical distance was less than the threshold distance . At a closer distance , 804 any further increase in ventilation rate was no longer effective . For example , for intense 805 activity , the short - range airborne infection risk is 16 . 5 % at 1 m when the ventilation rate is 806 100 L / s per person , but becomes 3 . 6 % at 2 m with the same ventilation . When the ventilation 807 is infinite , the infection risk is still 15 . 4 % at 1 m . 808 809 810 4 . 2 Explanation of some observed transmission phenomena 811 812 Short - range airborne infection risk increases as activity intensifies at any physical distance 813 and ventilation rate . For example , when the infectious quantum concentration is 0 . 1 quanta / L 814 at the mouth , at a physical distance of 1 . 5 m and a ventilation rate of 5 L / s per person , the 42 - 815 s short - range infection risk is 0 . 3 % for sedentary / passive activity , 1 . 9 % for light activity , 816 8 . 6 % for moderate activity , and 28 . 4 % for intense activity . Physical distancing or a high 817 ventilation rate alone is not sufficient to reduce the infection risk at close range in indoor 818 spaces . Physical distancing and ventilation need to be combined . 819 820 Our partial derivative method suggested a threshold distance of 0 . 59 m for sedentary / passive 821 activity , 1 . 1 m for light activity , 1 . 7m for moderate activity , and 2 . 6 m for intense activity . 822 The corresponding threshold ventilation rate was 8 L / s per person for sedentary / passive 823 activity , 20 L / s per person for light activity , 43 L / s per person for moderate activity , and 83 824 L / s per person for intense activity ( Figure 12 ) . The 42 - s short - range airborne infection risk at 825 the threshold conditions was 0 . 79 % for sedentary / passive activity , 0 . 82 % for standard 826 activity , 1 . 14 % for light activity , 1 . 74 % for moderate activity , and 2 . 61 % for intense activity . 827 Thus , if the threshold physical distance and ventilation rate are achieved , the short - range 828 airborne infection risk can be theoretically low ( Marr , 2021 ) . However , some existing 829 building ventilation systems may not satisfy the high ventilation rate required for moderate 830 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 24 and intense activities ( ASHRAE 62 . 1 , 2019 ) . Thus , a high risk of close - contact transmission 831 may be expected due to intense activities in such settings , as previously observed ( Bae et al . , 832 2020 ; Chu et al . , 2021 ) . 833 834 For sedentary / passive or light activities in indoor spaces ( e . g . , residential buildings or 835 offices ) , the current minimum ventilation rate can easily satisfy our estimated ventilation rate 836 requirement of 10 L / s per person . For example , the current ventilation standard is 8 . 5 L / s per 837 person in office spaces and 7 L / s per person in residential spaces ( ASHRAE 62 . 1 , 2019 ) . The 838 required physical distance thresholds of 0 . 59 and 1 . 1 m may also be easily satisfied in offices , 839 but not in homes . This may explain why there have been more household outbreaks than 840 office outbreaks ( Chan et al . , 2020 ; Qian et al . , 2020 ) . 841 842 In contrast , for moderate or intense activities ( e . g . , in fitness centres or gyms ) , the threshold 843 physical distance may be easily satisfied . However , the existing ventilation standards ( e . g . , 844 ASHRAE 62 . 1 , 2019 ) are far from meeting the required ventilation rates for moderate and 845 intense activities . For example , in a fitness centre with a ventilation rate of 10 and 240 L / s per 846 person , the 42 - s short - range airborne infection risks at a physical distance of 2 m are 15 . 2 % 847 and 2 . 4 % , respectively . This explains the difference in attack rate caused by ventilation 848 difference between super - spreading events in fitness centres and gyms ( Groves et al . , 2020 ; 849 Jang et al . , 2020 ; Chu et al . , 2021 ; Marr , 2021 ) . 850 851 In addition to physical activity intensity , the exhalation and inhalation rate also depend on 852 respiratory activity ( e . g . , breathing , speaking , singing ) ( Adams , 1993 ; US EPA , 2011 ) . 853 Speaking or singing activities increase exhalation and inhalation rates and thus , increase the 854 infection risk via both short - range and long - range airborne routes , which may explain why 855 there are higher infection risks in restaurants and at choir rehearsals than in other indoor 856 spaces with activities of equal intensity ( Lakha et al . , 2020 ; Li et al . , 2020 ; Miller et al . , 857 2021 ) . Moreover , some indoor spaces ( e . g . , bars and karaoke clubs ) with both intense activity 858 and speaking or singing activity meet neither the physical distance requirements nor the 859 ventilation rate requirements , which has led to a high infection risk and super - spreading 860 events in bars and karaoke clubs ( Adam et al . , 2020 ; Furuse et al . , 2020 ; Gu et al . , 2020 ; 861 Chau et al . , 2021 ) . 862 863 4 . 3 Infectious quantum emission rate for short - and long - range airborne routes 864 865 Two methods are currently available for estimating the infectious quantum generation rate . 866 The commonly used method is to use infection and ventilation data from a super - spreading 867 event ( e . g . , Miller et al . , 2021 ) . Only long - range quantum generation rates have been 868 estimated thus far , due to difficulties in isolating short - range infection data from long - range 869 infection , as close - contact scenarios are mostly unknown at the time of exposure . The viral 870 load and droplet release rate may also be used to estimate the quantum generation rate 871 ( Buonanno et al . , 2020 ) . This method has the potential to be developed for estimating both 872 short - and long - range quantum generation rates . However , additional data , such as the 873 survival of the virus in the short - range expired jet , are needed . This is a difficult problem to 874 solve , as the residence time of the aerosols in the expired jet is less than 1 or only a few 875 seconds . Virus survival characteristics within such a short duration are difficult to obtain . 876 There are no data for virus survival in aerosols within the first few seconds of their release . In 877 addition , the long - range quantum generation rate should be much less than the short - range 878 quantum generation rate , given that the size range of suspended aerosols within a close range 879 may be larger than the size range of suspended aerosols in the rest of the room ( Xie et al . , 880 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 25 2007 ; Gralton et al . , 2011 ) . The fraction 𝛾 values remain to be determined . 881 882 In this study , we made a crude estimate of the short - range infectious quantum generation rate 883 using data reported by Chu et al . ( 2020 ) . However , complexities exist when using these data . 884 The observed infection at close range reported by Chu et al . ( 2020 ) may have been due to the 885 lack of adherence to the threshold distance , such that at least some infections may have 886 occurred at a close distance . In such situations , our estimated short - range quantum generation 887 rate may have been over - estimated . It is also possible that the average close - contact exposure 888 period may be longer or shorter than our assumed values . A secondary infection may also be 889 the result of both short - and long - range exposure . A Monte Carlo method may be used in 890 future studies to perform such estimates , but more reliable data are needed . However , no 891 reliable short - range quantum generation rate exists . Thus , a reliable approach to estimate 892 short - and long - range quantum generation rates is needed . 893 894 4 . 4 Limitations of the study 895 896 There are several major limitations of this study . The short - range Wells - Riley model assumes 897 that the emission rate of bioeffluents or the number of exhaled droplets is proportional to the 898 exhalation rates for different activity intensities , and that the infectious quantum 899 concentration at the mouth is constant . For subjects infected with the human rhinovirus , the 900 exhaled particle concentration ( < 10 µm ) is likely to be proportional to minute ventilation at a 901 close range ( Fabian et al . , 2010 ) ; however , it remains unknown how the number and size 902 distribution of droplets exhaled by healthy subjects or subjects infected with a respiratory 903 virus vary when physical activity intensity and respiratory activity change . It is also unknown 904 how the virus concentration is distributed in different sizes of particles , even though Milton et 905 al . ( 2013 ) found that , for influenza virus , fine particles may contain a much higher number of 906 viral copies than coarse particles . Hence , data are needed on how the number and size 907 distribution of exhaled droplets change with activity intensity / mode , and how the infectious 908 quantum concentration at the mouth changes with exhaled droplet size . The dilution analysis 909 of short - range airborne infection risk in Section 3 . 4 was based on ventilation rate per infector 910 only , without considering effective dilution due to aerosols settling , filtration and virus 911 deactivation as suggested in Equation ( 14 ) . Our model ( Equation 22 ) is appliable to the 912 situation with multiple infectors , and in such situations , the overall room dilution air flow rate 913 should be used as in Equation ( 14 ) . 914 915 Several physical and biological assumptions were made in this study . Our model did not 916 consider particle settling or virus deactivation at a close range . A more accurate model needs 917 to consider dispersion of individual droplets in the expired jet . Evaporation or dehydration is 918 known to occur at a close range . Virus deactivation over a short range may need to be 919 considered . The jet trajectory changes due to buoyancy , but being ignored here , but the 920 dilution factor formula may still be applied along the trajectory . Our model simplified the 921 breathing profile as a square cycle , which may lead to an underestimation of the streamwise 922 penetration distance of the jet - like stage and an overestimation of the dilution factor at any 923 distance in the puff - like stage . Hence , the required physical distance and ventilation rate may 924 be underestimated . A calm air surrounding was assumed to avoid considering ambient 925 turbulent dispersion ; however , in reality , room air is not usually calm . Once the jet is 926 destroyed by the surrounding air flows , the short - range transmission merges into long - range 927 transmission . The change in streamlines when approaching the exposed individual affect the 928 inhalation exposure ( Chen et al . , 2020 ) . 929 930 J o u r n a l P r e - p r o o f 26 5 . Concluding remarks 931 932 Using the newly developed dilution factor formula , we estimated a dilution factor that 933 depends on the exhalation flow rate . In the jet - like stage , the newly estimated dilution factor 934 was similar to the dilution factor predicted by the steady jet model . However , the dilution 935 factor markedly increased in the puff - like stage for all activity intensities , with light activity 936 corresponding to a higher dilution than intense activity for a simple reason , i . e . , more intense 937 activity has a later transition point from jet - like to puff - like stages . The higher estimated 938 dilution factor indicates a more rapid decrease of the normalised concentration of virus - 939 containing particles within expired flows of the corresponding short - range exposure . 940 941 The newly developed dilution factor using the two - stage expired jet model has enabled the 942 development of a simple short - range infection risk model . The infectious quantum generation 943 rate differs between short - range and long - range airborne infection . The short - range quantum 944 generation rate remains to be determined . Following this uncertainty , we propose to use a 945 partial derivative approach to estimate the threshold distance and threshold ventilation rate . 946 The partial derivative approach has been shown to be valid when the infectious quantum 947 concentration is less than 1 quantum / L at the mouth , or when the equivalent quantum 948 generation rate is less than 360 quanta / h at an exhaled flow rate of 0 . 1 L / s . The newly defined 949 threshold distance and threshold ventilation rate are independent of the quantum 950 concentration . 951 952 The insights gained from this model are meaningful . For example , the model showed that 953 physical distancing or ventilation alone is generally not sufficient to reduce the infection risk 954 in indoor spaces . Poor ventilation leads to long - range airborne infection and increases the risk 955 of short - range airborne infection . Physical distancing is essential for minimising infection 956 risk at a close distance , and adequate ventilation may also reduce short - range infection risk , 957 especially in spaces used for high - intensity activity . However , a significant infection risk is 958 associated with a less - than - threshold physical distance . In such a situation , ventilation is no 959 longer effective , even if the ventilation rate is very high . The work will be useful for 960 developing ventilation standards for infection control . 961 962 Acknowledgements 963 This work was supported by a General Research Fund grant ( grant number 17202719 ) 964 provided by the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong .
