Herein , we describe the epidemiological characteristics of this outbreak and evaluate the implemented containment measures against this outbreak . Methodology / Principal findings Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention provided the data on SARS - CoV - 2 infections reported between 21 May and 24 June 2021 . We estimated the incubation period distribution by fitting a gamma distribution to the data , while the serial interval distribution was estimated by fitting a normal distribution . The instantaneous effective reproductive number ( R t ) was estimated to reflect the transmissibility of SARS - CoV - 2 . Clinical severity was compared for cases with different vaccination statuses using an ordinal regression model after controlling for age . Of the reported local cases , 7 / 153 ( 4 . 6 % ) were asymptom - atic . The median incubation period was 6 . 02 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 5 . 42 – 6 . 71 ) days and the means of serial intervals decreased from 5 . 19 ( 95 % CI : 4 . 29 – 6 . 11 ) to 3 . 78 ( 95 % CI : 2 . 74 – 4 . 81 ) days . The incubation period increased with age ( P < 0 . 001 ) . A hierarchical pre - vention and control strategy against COVID - 19 was implemented in Guangzhou , with R t decreasing from 6 . 83 ( 95 % credible interval [ CrI ] : 3 . 98 – 10 . 44 ) for the 7 - day time window ending on 27 May 2021 to below 1 for the time window ending on 8 June and thereafter . Indi - viduals with partial or full vaccination schedules with BBIBP - CorV or CoronaVac accounted for 15 . 3 % of the COVID - 19 cases . Clinical symptoms were milder in partially or fully vacci - nated cases than in unvaccinated cases ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 0 . 26 [ 95 % CI : 0 . 07 – 0 . 94 ] ) .

Authorised inactivated vaccines are likely to contribute to reducing the probability of developing severe disease . Our findings have important implications for the containment of COVID - 19 . Author summary On 11 May 2021 , the WHO reclassified the B . 1 . 617 . 2 variant as a “variant of concern” ( VOC ) from being a “variant of interest” , considering its global public health significance . On 21 May 2021 , the first local case infected with the Delta variant ( i . e . lineage B . 1 . 617 . 2 ) in Guangzhou , China , was reported . In response to the resurgence of COVID - 19 , the local government implemented a series of containment measures . This provides a valuable opportunity to understand the characteristics of the Delta variant and to evaluate the per - formance of inactivated COVID - 19 vaccines ( BBIBP - CorV and CoronaVac ) and other interventions . We estimated that the median incubation period was 6 . 02 days and the means of serial intervals decreased from 5 . 19 to 3 . 78 days . The incubation period increased with age . The vaccination coverage in the COVID - 19 cases was 15 . 3 % . Clinical symptoms were milder in cases with partial or full vaccination than in those who were unvaccinated ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 0 . 26 ) . We found that the effective reproductive number decreased from 6 . 83 for the 7 - day time window ending on 27 May 2021 to below 1 for the time window ending on 8 June and thereafter . Our findings have important implications for the containment of COVID - 19 . Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) is a serious threat to public health . Globally , there have been over 186 million confirmed cases and 4 . 0 million deaths as of 11 July 2021 [ 1 ] , and many efforts , such as non - pharmaceutical interventions ( NPIs ) and vaccination , have been imple - mented to prevent and contain COVID - 19 . The emergence of severe acute respiratory syn - drome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) variants has accelerated the spread of COVID - 19 [ 2 ] . In 2021 , explosive surges of SARS - CoV - 2 occurred in India . Circulation of the Delta variant ( i . e . lineage B . 1 . 617 . 2 ) , which was first identified in India , may have contributed to the devastating second wave of COVID - 19 in India [ 3 ] . On 11 May 2021 , the WHO reclassified the B . 1 . 617 . 2 variant as a “variant of concern” ( VOC ) from being a “variant of interest” , considering its global public health significance [ 4 ] . The variant has invaded more than 110 countries , territo - ries , and areas [ 1 ] . Meanwhile , this variant accounts for a large proportion of the newly sequenced and genotyped SARS - CoV - 2 cases in some locations , such as England ( > 90 % ) [ 5 ] . Understanding the epidemiological characteristics and clinical severity of the SARS - CoV - 2 Delta variant would help inform targeted interventions for containing the spread of COVID - 19 . Population movement is a critical influential factor of COVID - 19 transmission [ 6 ] . Guang - zhou is an important transportation hub in southern China , with over 15 million permanent residents and mass population mobility . In the first five months of 2021 , around 2 , 000 passen - gers were arriving in Guangzhou from abroad each day . The city is at high risk for COVID - 19 PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES Transmission and containment of the SARS - CoV - 2Delta variant in Guangzhou PLOS NeglectedTropical Diseases | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pntd . 0010048 January 5 , 2022 2 / 16 to L LI , the Key Projectof Medicine Discipline of Guangzhou [ 2021 – 2023 - 11 ] to L LUO , and the Basic Research Project of Key Laboratory of Guangzhou [ 202102100001 ] to L LUO .

There were , on average , eight COVID - 19 cases imported from abroad every day and no local case was reported between 1 January and 20 May 2021 . On 21 May , a local case infected with the Delta variant was reported in Guang - zhou [ 8 ] . In response to the resurgence of COVID - 19 , the local government implemented a series of containment measures , including vaccination programs , case finding through mass tests for COVID - 19 , case isolation , as well as other social distancing interventions . Timely assessment of the epidemiological features of the cases of SARS - CoV - 2 infection and the pre - vention and control measures would provide better preparedness for the COVID - 19 outbreak caused by highly infectious variants [ 9 ] . Several studies have reported promising vaccine efficacy results based on data collected from clinical trials . More real - world data are needed to elucidate vaccine effectiveness [ 10 ] . As of 31 May , over 10 million residents ( vaccination coverage : around 67 % ) in Guangzhou had received COVID - 19 vaccines ( BBIBP - CorV or CoronaVac ) , among whom , more than three million residents had been fully vaccinated [ 11 ] . This provides a valuable opportunity to evalu - ate the performance of the authorised inactivated COVID - 19 vaccines . Herein , we describe the epidemiological characteristics of the cases infected with SARS - CoV - 2 Delta VOC in Guang - zhou and evaluate the implemented containment measures . Methods Ethics statement This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of Guangzhou CDC ( No : GZCDC - ECHR - 2020P0019 ) . Consent to participate was waived since anonymous information was used . Data collection The Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) provided the individual data of all SARS - CoV - 2 infections reported between 21 May and 24 June 2021 in Guangzhou . Nasal and throat swabs were collected for COVID - 19 tests . Cases were confirmed to be SARS - - CoV - 2 infections using real - time reverse transcription - polymerase chain reaction ( rRT - PCR , S1 File ) . The individual information included sex , age , occupation class ( people who have retired and the unemployed , preschool children , students , healthcare workers , others ) , possible infection date , type of exposure ( family , having been at the same restaurant with a confirmed case , others ) , type of detection ( tracing of close contacts , mass screening , hospital screening ) , date of illness onset ( the date of symptom onset for the symptomatic cases and the date of sam - ple collection for the first positive test of asymptomatic cases ) , clinical severity ( asymptomatic , mild , moderate , severe , and critical according to the criteria proposed by the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China [ 12 ] , S1 Table ) . Seventy - five cases who did not have information on the exact infection date and who did not have symptoms were excluded when estimating the incubation period ( i . e . the time delay from infection to symptom onset ) distribution in the main analysis . A transmission pair was defined as two confirmed COVID - 19 cases that had clear epidemiological links with each other , i . e . one case ( infectee ) was infected by the other ( infector ) . Asymptomatic infectees and the infectees whose infectors were asymptomatic were excluded when estimating the serial interval ( i . e . the delay between symptom onset dates of successive cases in transmission pairs ) distribution . Symptom onset dates of 67 transmission pairs were used to estimate the serial interval distribution ( S1 Fig ) .

We estimated the incubation period distribution by fit - ting a lognormal , gamma , and Weibull distribution to the data using the maximum likelihood method and selected the distribution with the smallest value of Akaike Information Criteria ( AIC ) . The serial interval distributions were estimated by fitting normal distributions [ 13 , 14 ] . We estimated the distributions of serial intervals for the entire study period and for nine differ - ent time windows ( i . e . eight running time windows with a fixed length of 14 days and the last one was from 26 May through 24 June , making sure that all of the time windows contained at least 30 data points of serial intervals ) . We assessed the association between age and incubation period using a gamma regression model with a log link ( according to the selected distribution for incubation period ) , while the associations between age ( of infector and infectee ) and serial interval were examined in linear regression models , after controlling for the effects of calendar time . Previous studies have suggested that the instantaneous reproductive number is a better choice to examine the effectiveness of control measures compared with the case reproductive number [ 15 ] . In this study , we estimated the instantaneous effective reproductive number R t ( the average number of secondary cases arising from a typical primary infection [ 16 ] ) to reflect the transmissibility of SARS - CoV - 2 and to evaluate the performance of interventions imple - mented during this outbreak . The R t was estimated as : R t ¼ I t P ts ¼ 1 I t (cid:0) s w s where I t was the number of incident cases at time t and w s was estimated with the time - varying distributions of serial intervals [ 17 ] . When the time step of data is small , the estimates of R t can be highly variable and it would be difficult to interpret the results . To deal with this problem , we estimated the R t over a 7 - day time window assuming that the R t remains constant within the same time window . Such estimate reflects the average transmissibility for the time window of one week . We present the R t for the time window ending on 27 May and thereafter , since the estimates may be unstable at the very beginning of the outbreak with few cases [ 15 ] . We categorized the COVID - 19 cases into two groups based on their vaccination status ( Group 1 : unvaccinated ; Group 2 : partially or fully vaccinated [ infection occurred � 21 days after dose 1 ] ; 16 cases with indeterminate vaccination status [ infection occurred < 21 days after dose 1 or the time interval between the infection date and the vaccination date was unclear ] were excluded ) . The differences in the clinical severity of the local cases by vaccina - tion status were evaluated using an ordinal logistic regression model after controlling for the potentially confounding effect of age . Sensitivity analysis was conducted to check the robustness of ( 1 ) the estimate of incubation period distribution ( 1a ) assuming that the incubation period followed the distributions which were not corresponding to the smallest AIC ; ( 1b ) including seven additional cases with the information of possible exposure dates or exposure windows ; ( 2 ) the association between age and incubation period using the models with three independent variables of age , calendar time , and one potentially influential factor ( i . e . occupation , type of exposure or clinical sever - ity ) which was statistically significant in bivariate regression models ( with calendar time and one potentially influential factor as the independent variables ) . All analyses were conducted using R software ( version 4 . 1 . 0 ; R Foundation for Statistical Computing ) .

Later , on 21 May , the woman was confirmed to be infected with the Delta VOC . She was the first local case infected with this variant in Guangzhou ( Fig 1 ) . SARS - CoV - 2 was transmitted from the woman to her friend Case # 3 and a waitress ( reported outside Guangzhou ) when they were having a meal in a restaurant . Her husband was also infected . Case # 3 brought SARS - CoV - 2 to seven family members and eight friends when having a meal in a restaurant and dancing with friends . Case # 19 , who infected as many as 16 residents , was Fig 1 .

In this outbreak , a total of seven generations were found to be associated with the transmission chain initiated by the first infection of the Delta variant ( Fig 2 ) . The number of cases increased gradually from the start of this outbreak and peaked on 1 June with 16 residents showing symptoms or testing positive for SARS - CoV - 2 on that day . Thereafter , the number of cases fluctuated and showed a decreasing trend ( Fig 1 ) . From 19 June through 24 June 2021 , no local case has been reported in Guangzhou . From 21 May to 24 June 2021 , there were 153 local cases reported in Guangzhou ( symp - tomatic cases : 146 [ 95 . 4 % ] ; asymptomatic infections : 7 [ 4 . 6 % ] ) . The median age of the local cases was 48 ( range : 1 – 94 ) years , and males accounted for 41 . 2 % of these cases ( Table 1 ) . More than half of the cases were people who had retired and the unemployed . Preschool children , students , healthcare workers , and others represented 3 . 3 % , 16 . 3 % , 2 . 6 % , and 26 . 8 % of the local cases , respectively . During the study period , 24 ( 15 . 7 % ) , 113 ( 73 . 9 % ) , 0 ( 0 . 0 % ) , and 9 ( 5 . 9 % ) of the patients had mild , moderate , severe , and critical disease severity , respectively ( Table 1 ) . We identified 103 cases with a clear exposure history : 53 ( 51 . 5 % ) were observed within fam - ily households , 36 ( 35 . 0 % ) took place in restaurants , and 14 ( 13 . 6 % ) were linked via other exposures ( Table 1 ) . Results suggested that the gamma distribution fitted best to the incubation period in terms of AIC ( S2 Table ) . The mean and median incubation periods and were 6 . 50 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : 5 . 86 – 7 . 20 ) and 6 . 02 ( 95 % CI : 5 . 42 – 6 . 71 ) days , respectively . The 95 th percentile of the incubation periods was 12 . 27 ( 95 % CI : 10 . 68 – 13 . 84 ) days . As for the serial interval , the mean and standard deviation were 4 . 24 ( 95 % CI : 3 . 35 – 5 . 14 ) and 3 . 95 ( 95 % CI : 3 . 23 – 4 . 61 ) days , respectively ( Fig 3 ) for the entire study period . In addition , we found that the means of serial intervals of different time windows decreased gradually from 5 . 19 ( 95 % CI : Fig 2 . Transmission network of the infections of the SARS - CoV - 2 Delta variant . A total of 101 and 13 cases reported in Guangzhou and other cities with information for determining the generation are presented .

The incubation period was positively associated with age ( P < 0 . 001 , S4 Table ) , while the associations between age ( of infector and infectee ) and serial interval were statistically non - significant ( S5 and S6 Tables ) . In response to the COVID - 19 outbreak , the local government formulated a hierarchical prevention and control strategy to suppress community transmission . Generally speaking , Guangzhou was divided into three areas according to the risk level of SARS - CoV - 2 transmis - sion . The core areas were the cluster areas in which many COVID - 19 cases were reported . The warning zones were the places in which sporadic cases have been found . Other areas were low - risk areas . The level of response to COVID - 19 increased with the risk level , with the most rig - orous interventions taking place in the areas with the highest level of transmission risk . A series of NPIs and vaccinations were implemented during this outbreak ( Fig 1 and S7 Table ) . Notably , one of the most important measures was case finding through mass tests for COVID - 19 among residents in the core areas , warning zones and then the low - risk areas . By 6 June 2021 , the entire population of the city had been tested for COVID - 19 . As of 12 June , over 36 million samples had been collected for SARS - CoV - 2 tests . In the core areas and warning zones , multiple rRT - PCR tests have been performed . Vaccination is another important mea - sure for the containment of COVID - 19 . On 31 May , mass vaccination was stopped and the focus was shifted to case finding through mass tests for COVID - 19 . However , vaccination was Table 1 .

By 24 June , 10 . 77 million residents had been vaccinated , among whom , 8 . 72 million had been fully vaccinated . Other interventions included quarantine for high - risk groups , rigorous inspection ( e . g . requiring residents to show health codes , measuring body temperature ) , requiring wearing masks , limiting public gatherings , etc ( S7 Table ) . In this out - break , 99 cases ( 64 . 7 % ) were in close contact with confirmed cases , while 46 ( 30 . 1 % ) were detected through mass screening ( Table 1 ) . With these efforts , R t decreased rapidly from 6 . 83 ( 95 % credible interval [ CrI ] : 3 . 98 – 10 . 44 ) for the 7 - day time window ending on 27 May 2021 to below 1 for the time window ending on 8 June and thereafter ( Fig 1 ) . We found that 21 cases were partially or fully vaccinated before infection ( 15 . 3 % ) among the 137 cases ( excluding the 16 cases with indeterminate vaccination status , Table 2 ) . Clinical symptoms were milder in the partially or fully vaccinated cases than the unvaccinated group ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 0 . 26 [ 95 % CI : 0 . 07 – 0 . 94 ] , Table 3 ) . Notably , no critical cases were observed in those who had been partially or fully vaccinated , while 9 / 116 of the unvaccinated cases were critical cases ( Table 2 ) . Results of sensitivity analysis suggested that the estimates of mean , median and 95 th percen - tile of incubation periods were similar to the ones in the main analysis ( S8 Table ) . The associa - tions of incubation period with occupation and type of exposure were statistically significant in bivariate regression models ( S9 Table ) . Age was positively associated with incubation period in the model with an additional inclusion of occupation and the one with type of exposure ( S10 and S11 Tables ) . Discussion In this study , we provided a detailed description of the first community transmission of the SARS - CoV - 2 Delta VOC in Guangzhou , China , providing important epidemiological parame - ters of this outbreak . We found that 4 . 6 % of the cases during the study period were asymptom - atic , a figure lower than the 15 . 6 % reported in a previous systematic review [ 18 ] . The difference in age structure and definitions of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases may explain the variation in the proportion of asymptomatic infections . We estimated that the mean and median incubation periods were 6 . 50 and 6 . 02 days , respectively , which were slightly longer than the pooled estimates of the mean ( 6 . 3 days ) and median incubation periods ( 5 . 4 days ) of preexisting strains reported in a systematic review and meta - analysis [ 19 ] .

Consistent with a prior study in Singapore [ 21 ] , we found that the incuba - tion period was positively associated with age . The longer incubation period observed in the old cases probably resulted from a slower immune response in the elderly [ 21 , 23 ] . The higher proportion of old cases ( 22 . 2 % of the local cases were aged 70 years and older ) in this outbreak may in part contribute to a longer incubation period than that for the transmission in 2020 in 30 provinces of China [ 24 ] . Older age of the subjects in the present study may also explain why our estimate of the mean of incubation period was larger than 5 . 8 days which was reported in a study of the Delta variant [ 25 ] . We found that the maximum incubation period was 15 days , which indicated that longer quarantine periods ( > 14 days ) would be required for extreme cases [ 26 ] . Seven generations were found to be associated with the transmission chain initiated by the first infection of the Delta variant in approximately 20 days , which indicated that this variant may be transmitted rapidly . A previous study in the United Kingdom reported that the house - hold transmission rate associated with the Delta variant was higher than that of the Alpha vari - ant , which was found to have a 43 – 90 % higher reproductive number than the preexisting strains [ 27 , 28 ] . In England , the first confirmed case of the Delta variant was detected in late March 2021 , and this variant accounted for more than 90 % of all new cases at the end of May 2021 [ 28 , 29 ] , which also suggested its potential for high transmissibility . Our study estimated that the mean and standard deviation of serial intervals were 4 . 24 and 3 . 95 days , respectively for the entire study period . A substantial fraction of secondary transmission was likely to occur prior to illness onset given the shorter serial interval compared with the incubation period [ 30 ] . Our estimate of the mean serial interval was larger than that for the strains circu - lating in early 2020 in China ( 3 . 66 days for the locally infected ) [ 14 ] and the Delta variant cir - culating in Daejeon , South Korea ( 3 . 26 days ) [ 31 ] . In addition , we estimated that the means of serial intervals of different time windows decreased from 5 . 19 to 3 . 78 days . Shorten estimates of means of serial intervals over time were also reported in previous studies [ 17 , 25 ] . The esti - mate of R t is influenced by the mean and standard deviation of serial interval . A larger mean of serial interval may lead to a higher R t , while a larger standard deviation may result in a R t which is closer to 1 [ 17 ] . Therefore , estimating R t for the Delta VOC using the estimate of pre - existing strains may introduce bias . In this study , we estimated the R t based on the time - varying distributions of serial intervals and found that R t declined from 6 . 83 for the time window ending on 27 May 2021 to below 1 for the time window ending on 8 June and thereafter , which suggested that the interventions in Guangzhou were timely and effective . It is worth noting that the estimated R t should be interpreted in the context of reduced transmission with great efforts , including social distanc - ing interventions and mass vaccination programs in Guangzhou .

This finding suggests that case finding through mass tests for COVID - 19 and case isolation are of great importance for the control of COVID - 19 when the implementation is feasible . It is recommended to implement mass screening to detect the COVID - 19 cases when some cases of unknown origin occur and it seems that the pathogen spreads . Vaccination is an important intervention for the prevention and control of infectious dis - eases . Randomized - controlled trials and observational studies have revealed vaccine efficacy / effectiveness ranging from 50 – 95 % against symptomatic COVID - 19 caused by preexisting strains , including the Alpha variant [ 10 , 32 , 33 ] . A recent study in the United States indicated that the adjusted effectiveness of the authorised mRNA vaccines in preventing SARS - CoV - 2 infection was 91 % and 81 % with full vaccination and partial vaccination , respectively , when administered in real - world conditions [ 34 ] . In Chile , the effectiveness of CoronaVac was 65 . 9 % , 87 . 5 % , and 90 . 3 % for the prevention of infection , hospitalization , and ICU admission for the individuals with fully immunized [ 35 ] . In Guangzhou , the vaccination coverage of the whole population ( 67 % ) was approximately 2 . 4 times higher than the coverage of COVID - 19 cases ( 15 . 3 % ) . In this study , we found that the partially or fully vaccinated cases generally had milder symptoms than those in the unvaccinated group after controlling for age . In addition , Li et al . conducted a test - negative case - control study to assess the effectiveness of inactivated vaccines among residents aged 18 – 59 in Guangzhou using the close contacts of confirmed cases as controls [ 36 ] . Results suggested that the overall vaccine effectiveness for two - dose vac - cination was 59 . 0 % against COVID - 19 and 70 . 2 % against moderate COVID - 19 . These data further implied that the authorised inactivated vaccines are probably capable of protecting people from the Delta VOC , and vaccination can reduce the probability of the occurrence of severe disease . In Guangzhou , the target population of vaccination was mainly residents aged 18 – 59 years without contraindications during the study period . Currently , the vaccination is free for residents aged 12 years of age and older in China , as more evidence has proved that the authorised inactivated COVID - 19 vaccines are safe and effective [ 37 – 40 ] . Mass screening and vaccination are labour - intensive , especially when the two measures are implemented at the same time . In China , community health centers and hospitals organize the mass screening and vaccination , with great support from volunteers . We found that 37 vaccinated individuals were infected in this outbreak . Vaccine break - through infections were also reported in other locations [ 41 , 42 , 43 ] . Nevertheless , the vaccine breakthrough infections only occurred in a small percentage of vaccinated individuals , mean - while , these cases merely represented a small fraction of COVID - 19 cases [ 41 ] . COVID - 19 vac - cination is still an effective measure to prevent infection , severe illness , and death [ 42 ] . Given that the infections can occur in vaccinated individuals , personal protection measures , such as wearing masks in indoor public settings where the transmission risk of COVID - 19 is high , are still needed [ 42 ] . We found that 51 . 5 % of the transmission pairs had a family bound . Consistently , transmis - sion within family households was the most frequent in the first wave of COVID - 19 in Guang - zhou and Hong Kong [ 44 , 45 ] . SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in restaurants has been reported previously [ 46 ] . Improving ventilation and increasing the distance between tables may reduce the infection risk [ 46 ] . Eating at restaurants was restricted in this outbreak , which has in part mitigated the transmission of COVID - 19 . Our study had some limitations . First , our analysis mainly focused on the characteristics of the cases of SARS - CoV - 2 infection reported in Guangzhou , since some important information ( e . g . symptom onset date , clinical severity , and vaccination status ) of the cases reported in other cities was not available . Second , the infection and symptom onset dates were reported by PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES Transmission and containment of the SARS - CoV - 2Delta variant in Guangzhou PLOS NeglectedTropical Diseases | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1371 / journal . pntd . 0010048 January 5 , 2022 11 / 16 the patients and the infection dates were not clear for some COVID - 19 cases . Also , some trans - mission pairs were not determined . Potential bias may influence the estimates of the incuba - tion period , serial interval , and R t . Third , we did not account for pre - symptomatic transmission when estimating R t . This will be addressed in future studies . Next , we did not evaluate a specific intervention in this study but the combination of various control measures , since these interventions were implemented simultaneously , and it was difficult to distinguish their effects . In addition , it would be more informative if averted number of COVID - 19 cases attributable to the interventions can be provided . Further studies will quantify the effects using mathematical and statistical models . Last , possibly insufficient sample size can affect the statis - tical power and the conclusion . For instance , the sample size for the inference of the effect of vaccination status on clinical severity may be not sufficient . More solid evidence will be avail - able with real - world data from a large sample size . In conclusion , the hierarchical prevention and control strategy against COVID - 19 in Guangzhou was timely and effective . Case finding through mass tests for COVID - 19 and case isolation are important for the containment of SARS - CoV - 2 transmission if the implementa - tion is feasible . Receiving the authorised inactivated vaccines may reduce the probability of developing severe disease after infection . It is recommended that eligible individuals be vacci - nated to better protect themselves against COVID - 19 . Our findings have important implica - tions for the containment of COVID - 19 .
