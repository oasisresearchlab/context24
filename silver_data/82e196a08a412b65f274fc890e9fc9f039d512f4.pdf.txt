Film as Invisible Design : The example of the Biometric Daemon Abstract Film is an accessible medium that can be used naturally to elicit comment and critique . We are developing a series of experimental films that can convey user - experience without explicitly depicting the object that generates that experience . In doing this , we are building upon the idea ( well rehearsed in the scientific debate about mental imagery ) that some visual representations can be inexplicitly non - committal about the presence or absence of certain objects or features . Our films are explicitly non - committal about the objects they describe – in the sense that the devices are deliberately kept hidden or invisible to the user . We present one such film that captures a security device we call a Biometric Daemon – essentially an electronic pet that thrives on biometric signals . Crucially , the Daemon is never shown in the film . Keywords Video Content / Communication , Handheld Devices and Mobile Computing , Design Methods , Security ACM Classification Keywords H5 . 2 .
