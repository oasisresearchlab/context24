Speciﬁcally , we consider three testing strategies : 1 ) symptomatic isolation , where we test symptomatic individuals and isolate them when they test positive , 2 ) reactive screening , where a class is screened once one symptomatic individual was identiﬁed , and 3 ) repetitive screening , where the school in its entirety is screened on regular time intervals . Through this analysis , we demonstrate that repetitive testing strategies can signif - icantly reduce the attack rate in schools , contrary to a reactive screening approach . Furthermore , we investigate the impact of these testing strate - gies on the average number of school days lost per child . 1 Introduction The SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic has caused over 200 million COVID - 19 cases and over 4 million deaths around the world up to September 2021 [ 23 ] . Although vaccines have been approved and are widely administered , to date , these vaccines only received approval for its use in adults and ado - lescents in Europe ( i . e . , 12 + years old ) [ 9 ] . While the contribution of children in the COVID - 19 epidemic is still subject to ongoing debate [ 10 ] , there is a consensus that more infectious variants can cause signiﬁcant outbreaks among children [ 2 ] . Furthermore , recent work indicates that children , who typically undergo an infection with little or no symptoms , might still be highly contagious and as such generate new infections in the community [ 17 ] . In the absence of a licensed vaccine for children , the only means to mitigate outbreaks of SARS - CoV - 2 in primary schools , is through non - pharmaceutical interventions , including the use of masks , so - cial distancing , hygienic precautions and diagnostic testing . Here , the aim of diagnostic testing is to detect and subsequently isolate infected indi - viduals . Therefore , it is important to advance our understanding on how diﬀerent testing strategies impact primary schools , considering the evolu - tion of SARS - CoV - 2 contagiousness through diﬀerent variants of concerns ( VoCs ) . When deﬁning intervention policies in a school setting , attention needs to be devoted to limiting the number of school days lost . In fact , Engzell et al . evaluated the impact of school closures on students’ learn - ing performance , ﬁnding that students made less progress while learning from home [ 8 ] . In this work , we use a model - based approach to evalu - ate diﬀerent testing strategies in a primary school context , to assess the impact of such strategies on the school environment in terms of disease spread and the average number of school days missed per child . To this end we construct an individual - based model that explicitly represents a set of primary school pupils . These pupils are allocated to a ﬁxed set of classes and are taught by a ﬁxed set of teachers . Through this micro - model , we perform a ﬁne - grained evaluation of testing strategies , keeping track of both the attack rate and the number of school days lost . We con - duct experiments considering diﬀerent R 0 values to reﬂect the increase in infectiousness exhibited by the most recent Delta VoC . Through our modelling experiments we present two major ﬁndings . Firstly , we demonstrate that repetitive testing policies can signiﬁcantly 2 All rights reserved .

Secondly , we ﬁnd that a purely reac - tive testing approach , where a class is only screened once a symptomatic individual was identiﬁed , is an ineﬀective policy to reduce the attack rate given the asymptomatic nature of SARS - CoV - 2 infections in children , and such strategies might confer a false sense of security . Simulation results are consistent throughout the diﬀerent simulated settings , in which the assumptions on the model parameter values are challenged in a sensitivity analysis . Furthermore , our model and experimental results provide a sub - stantial basis for subsequent analysis on how to react to future pandemics in schools , as we show the impact of the proportion of asymptomatic infection on testing strategies . 2 Individual - based primary school model We construct an individual - based model to describe COVID - 19 outbreaks in a primary school setting , which we brieﬂy introduce in this section 1 . Children are assigned to classes and we simulate interactions among chil - dren both within and between classes . Teachers are allocated to speciﬁc classes and are assumed to interact only with individuals with whom they share the same class . We assume that symptomatic individuals develop symptoms at the peak of their infectiousness , at which they can be de - tected and placed in isolation for 10 days . We implement three testing policies aimed at mitigating school outbreaks : • Symptomatic Isolation ( SI ) . Symptomatic individuals are detected with probability p D and tested . Individuals that test positive are put in isolation . • Reactive Screening ( ReaS ) . Symptomatic individuals are detected with probability p D and tested . Individuals that test positive are put in isolation . In addition , all members of the class where this case originates from are also tested . When any additional cases are detected , these individuals are also put in isolation . • Repetitive Screening ( RepS ) . All of the school’s members are tested on a repetitive basis . All individuals that test positive are put in isolation . All testing policies will close a class when the number of infections in this class exceeds 2 cases . Analogously , all testing policies will close the school when the number of infections over all classes exceeds 20 cases . Infection counts are recorded in a 14 day time window to determine class and school closures . These assumptions are challenged in a sensitivity analysis , which we discuss in the Results section . 1 We refer to the Supplementary Information for a full description of the model . 3 All rights reserved .

We represent both the Wuhan strain of SARS - CoV - 2 and the Delta variant by setting diﬀerent transmission potentials given a contact , informing such values from the literature [ 13 , 4 ] . We consider a distinct detection probability of symptoms p D for children ( p D = 0 . 3 ) and adults ( p D = 0 . 5 ) , as children typically exhibit such mild symptoms that are easily overlooked [ 18 ] . Children are set to be halve as susceptible as adults [ 7 ] . We assume that 30 % of school children are immune due to prior infection 2 , and that 90 % of the teachers are immune , due to their vaccination status or due to prior infection . The simulated testing procedure accounts for the use of PCR tests on saliva or throat washing samples . The sensitivity of such tests is set to 86 % , and there is a one day delay in reporting the result [ 5 ] . Recent reports show that the performance of saliva sampling in combination with PCR testing is on par with nasopharyngeal swab sampling in combination with PCR testing [ 24 ] . We assume full compliance to testing , that could potentially be reached since saliva sampling is less invasive compared to other specimen collection procedures . Infectious individuals become PCR detectable 2 days after infection , as previously assumed [ 20 , 21 ] . For the reactive screening testing policy , we assume that there is a one day screening delay . Every simulated week , ﬁve susceptible children are assumed to acquire infection outside the school environment , accounting for disease importa - tion or seeding . The epidemic is simulated for 100 days and we consider 100 simulation runs to present our ﬁnal results . In each simulated out - break , we keep track of the total number of infections and the total number of school days lost . 3 Results To investigate the eﬃcacy of the testing strategies , we consider both the attack rate 3 and the average number of school days lost per child ( NSDL ) . In order to diﬀerentiate between the initial and current phase of the epi - demic , we compare two scenarios that represent the Wuhan strain and the Delta VoC , characterized by a diﬀerent transmission potential given a contact . While the overall trends of the reported measures are similar for the Wuhan and Delta scenarios , the diﬀerence between the testing strate - gies is most pronounced in case of a more infectious virus strain ( i . e . , the Delta VoC ) . On the one hand , our experiments show ( Figure 1 ) that symptomatic isolation results in the infection of a signiﬁcant proportion of the school population . This comes as no surprise , as in our model we assume that 80 % of the pupils will go through the infection asymptomatically , and by following this testing policy , we are only able to pick up infections that make up the tip of the iceberg . On the other hand , the attack rate con - sistently decreases when a testing policy is used that performs a wider 2 https : / / www . sciensano . be / sites / default / files / report _ seroprev _ sars - cov - 2 _ schools _ t4 _ oct2021 . pdf 3 Proportion of the infections generated in the school population , excluding seeded cases . 4 All rights reserved .

Such policies enable the detection of both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases , that can be subsequently isolated , thereby limiting further transmissions . However , contrary to intuition , our experiments indicate that the reactive screening strategy performs only slightly better than symptomatic isolation . This can be explained by the low proba - bility that pupils will be symptomatic when infected , hence a low prob - ability to trigger the reactive screening . When we assume that 80 % of infections in children progress asymptomatically , we can expect that four asymptomatic generations take place , on average , before a symptomatic infection is observed 4 . Therefore , when a reactive screening procedure is triggered by a symptomatic individual , the infected individuals that share a class with this individual might already be recovered or in the end phase of their infectious period . Hence , on average , only a few generations can be avoided by employing a reactive screening strategy , when the infection is predominantly driven by asymptomatic carriers . Note that we also as - sume that only a limited percentage of symptomatic children is detected ( 30 % ) , due to the fact that many children exhibit only minor symptoms . To interpret the experimental results with respect to the average num - ber of school days lost per child ( NSDL ) , we need to recognize that chil - dren can miss school due to isolation when infected or due to quarantine due to a high risk contact . For the symptomatic isolation strategy , only children with symptoms are isolated , resulting in an average NSDL per child that is directly proportional to the fraction symptomatic cases . For reactive screening , additional asymptomatic pupils might be identiﬁed , thereby quickly reaching the class or school closure thresholds , with a higher NSDL as a result . This eﬀect is most pronounced when we ap - ply repetitive testing , where we eﬀectively detect a high proportion of the infections , thereby rapidly meeting the class and / or school closure thresholds , with a very high NSDL as a consequence . We note that the high NSDL associated with repetitive testing , renders this testing policy impractical . However , we observe that the class and school closure thresholds were selected in order to avoid major outbreaks . We argue that , by using repetitive testing , more lenient thresholds could be applied , as we are able to detect a larger proportion of cases . We investigate this in Figure 2 where we remove the school closure threshold , and investigate a set of class closure thresholds . This experiment conﬁrms that a larger threshold can be used , with only a limited impact on the attack rate , and that such thresholds result in a more acceptable NSDL . In order to challenge some of the assumptions of this study , we conduct a series of sensitivity analyses . We show these results in the Supplemen - tary Information and brieﬂy report the main ﬁndings . We investigate the impact of the amount of weekly introductions , by seeding 1 and 10 cases on a weekly basis , next to the baseline scenario of 5 cases . We note that the impact of additional seeding cases ampliﬁes the attack rate , but overall repetitive testing proved to be robust in regard of this parame - 4 We assume a probability of asymptomatic infection of 0 . 8 , therefore , we have the num - ber of asymptomatic generations prior to encountering a symptomatic case by considering a geometric distribution’s mean , which is given by 1 / p , where p = 1 − 0 . 8 . 5 All rights reserved .

Furthermore , the high eﬃcacy of repetitive testing is also observed when varying the level of contact reduction between classes , and when considering diﬀerent levels of immunity in children and adults . Next , we assume that asymptomatic individuals are as infectious as symptomatic individuals , as recently observed by Meuris et al . [ 17 ] . Also in this case the trends of attack rate and number of school days lost among the diﬀer - ent testing strategies are consistent with the baseline scenarios reported above . Finally , we consider a repetitive testing scenario where we test the entire school population twice per week , which shows that such a strategy squashes even an highly contagious epidemic ( Figure 3 ) . 6 All rights reserved .

Throughout all simulated scenarios , a repetitive testing procedure is shown to be most eﬃcient to reduce the attack rate . Simulations indicate that such a testing strategy limits the number of transmission events even when no class and school closures are in place . The low eﬃcacy of the symptomatic testing and reactive screening procedures is explained by the asymptomatic nature of SARS - CoV - 2 infections , especially for children . In fact , when surveil - lance is based just on the onset of symptoms , asymptomatic carriers avoid detection and intervention , sustaining the spread of the virus . Class and school closures aﬀect the number of school days lost of healthy children . To limit the learning loss caused by such closures , a control strategy in which only infected cases are isolated would be opti - mal . With our experiments , we show that a repetitive testing strategy can achieve this . While keeping transmissions under control , a limited number of school days lost is computed when no thresholds are in place . In our experiments , we consider PCR tests as golden standard , as we argue that the available testing infrastructure is most appropriate for performing reactive and repetitive screening procedures [ 14 ] . To make this procedure more eﬃcient , a class pooling approach could be used to reduce the number of samples to be analyzed [ 14 ] . However , we argue that in order to implement pool - based testing on a large scale , a population - based evaluation of the sensitivity of pooled PCR testing is warranted [ 14 ] . To further reduce the number of required PCR tests , the use of a repetitive testing strategy can be targeted to areas where prevalence is particularly high . The presented simulation model was set to describe the spreading of COVID - 19 . However , other infectious diseases can easily be represented , incorporating the speciﬁc transmission characteristics of the pathogens in the simulator . Especially in the case of emerging epidemics or pandemics with higher contagiousness in child - to - child interactions and / or a higher severity for children , an appropriate testing strategy in a school setting is pivotal to dampen epidemic spread . By using the developed model , ad - hoc testing strategies can be simulated oﬀering valuable insights in controlling epidemics . Furthermore , an additional range of scenarios could be simulated , gathering information on the best policy that needs to be applied in speciﬁc epidemiological contexts . Other work has shown that viral load for symptomatic and asymp - tomatic carriers is similar [ 17 ] , indicating that their transmission poten - tial is the same . We tested this assumption noticing an overall increase in the attack rate values . Our experiments conﬁrm that repetitive screening procedures reduce the risks of school transmissions in this scenario . We assume that teachers are allocated to speciﬁc classes and are as - sumed to interact only with individuals with whom they share the same class . This means that the interaction between teachers in the school en - vironment is limited . We argue that this is a reasonable assumption at this stage of the epidemic , where a large proportion of teachers is either immune or vaccinated . In order to add such functionality to the model , an 8 All rights reserved .

In this work , we assume perfect compliance by school individuals for both the reactive and repetitive screening . We argue that this is a reason - able assumption , as the threshold for participating in saliva sampling is low , and societal awareness and support for this policies can be achieved , via prompt governmental communication . Nonetheless , we acknowledge that evaluating reduced compliance is interesting to consider , as a means to monitor the epidemic situation when prevalence is low , or to reduce the number of required tests , when such tests are only scarcely available , e . g . , at the start of a pandemic . Compliance of testing can be incorpo - rated in the simulator by randomly sampling a proportion of the school population , prior to testing . 5 Availability of data and materials Source code of the individual - based model was implemented in R and is available in the GitHub repository at the following link : https : / / github . com / AndreaTorneri / TestingStrategies . 6 Funding L .

[ 21 ] to investigate school settings . In this model , the infection dynamic is described as follows . Individuals are initially susceptible and once infected , they enter the exposed stage . The infection can be asymptomatic or symptomatic . Symptomatic individuals develop symptoms after a pre - symptomatic period . Each symptomatic in - dividual is assumed to show symptoms at the peak of their infectiousness , as indicated by literature ﬁndings [ 19 , 1 ] . After infection , individuals will eventually recover , after which they are assumed to be immune to rein - fection . Infection events are simulated with a counting process approach . First , contacts between individuals are generated . Contacts are eﬀectives , i . e . lead to the transmission of the virus , according to a Bernoulli trial , based on the time since infection . Eﬀective contacts that take place between sus - ceptible and infectious individuals result in infection events . The proba - bility that a contact is eﬀective is composed of two factors : the infectivity measure , ν ( t ) and the transmission potential q , which accounts for the transmissibility of the pathogen and the susceptibility of the exposed in - dividual . In this context , the basic reproduction number of an infectious disease is approximated with the mean number of eﬀective contacts an in - fectious individual generates in a fully susceptible population throughout his or her infectious period [ 21 ] . The infectivity measure ν ( t ) is deﬁned over the exposed and infectious period of the infected individual and is set to represent the shape of the viral load curve for a SARS - CoV - 2 infection , under the assumption that a higher amount of virus corresponds to a higher transmission probability [ 3 ] . Based on literature ﬁndings , we deﬁne an infectivity measure that peaks at symptom onset and lasts 10 days , on average [ 25 , 26 , 12 , 16 , 15 , 1 , 6 ] . In addition , ν ( t ) has an initial plateau with value zero that accounts for the exposed phase . Asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals are assumed to have the same viral progression , as argued in [ 27 , 26 ] , but we introduce a diﬀerent level of infectiousness between infectious individuals based on the clinical outcome . Precisely , the relative infectiousness of asymptomatic compared to symptomatic is 0 . 5 [ 7 ] . School classes , pupils and teachers We consider a population of children in primary school ( 6 - 12 years old ) , where each child is randomly allocated to a class . To this end , we construct a set of classes of which the size is sampled from a probability mass function informed by a survey on Belgian primary schools 5 , up until at least 1000 pupils are allocated to these classes . In the school , we consider teaching and supportive staﬀ , to which we will refer as teachers from this point forward for brevity .

We consider diﬀerent contact ratios within λ w and between λ b classes , and assume that teachers have contacts with children and other teachers of their allocated classes . The within and between classes contact rates for children are set accordingly to a contact data survey that took place in Belgium [ 11 ] . The within class contact rate is given by number of contacts that take place in primary schools and last more than 1 hr ( λ w = 6 . 62 ) . The between class contact rate is computed as the the number of contacts that last less than 1 hr ( λ b = 2 . 5 ) . However , we assumed that in a pandemic setting the number of between class contacts is reduced . In the baseline scenario , we assumed that the between contact rate in a COVID - 19 pandemic scenario is 30 % of λ b . We test such assumption in the sensitivity analysis by varying this proportion among 20 % , 50 % and 90 % .
