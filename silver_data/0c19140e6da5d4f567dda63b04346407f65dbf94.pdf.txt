Molecular Biology of the Cell MBoC | ARTICLE Ipl1 / Aurora - B is necessary for kinetochore restructuring in meiosis I in Saccharomyces cerevisiae ABSTRACT In mitosis , the centromeres of sister chromosomes are pulled toward opposite poles of the spindle . In meiosis I , the opposite is true : the sister centromeres move together to the same pole , and the homologous chromosomes are pulled apart . This change in segre - gation patterns demands that between the final mitosis preceding meiosis and the first meiotic division , the kinetochores must be restructured . In budding yeast , unlike mammals , kinetochores are largely stable throughout the mitotic cycle . In contrast , previous work with budding and fission yeast showed that some outer kinetochore proteins are lost in early meiosis . We use quantitative mass spectrometry methods and imaging approaches to ex - plore the kinetochore restructuring process that occurs in meiosis I in budding yeast . The Ndc80 outer kinetochore complex , but not other subcomplexes , is shed upon meiotic entry . This shedding is regulated by the conserved protein kinase Ipl1 / Aurora - B and promotes the subsequent assembly of a kinetochore that will confer meiosis - specific segregation patterns on the chromosome . INTRODUCTION Sexual reproduction relies on two key events : the formation of cells with haploid genomes ( sperm and eggs ) and the restoration of diploidy after their fusion . Meiosis is the specialized cell division program used to generate haploid gametes by halving the number of chromosomes . The proper execution of this process is essential because errors in meiotic segregation result in aneuploidy , which in humans is the leading cause of miscarriages and birth defects ( Hassold and Hunt , 2001 ; Nagaoka et al . , 2012 ) . During meiosis , a single round of DNA replication is followed by two successive divi - sions : meiosis I , which segregates homologous chromosomes away from one another ( reductional division ) , and meiosis II , which segregates the sister centromeres ( equational division ; Brar and Amon , 2008 ; Watanabe , 2012 ) . The establishment of this meiotic segregation pattern requires major structural changes that affect the way in which the chromosomes interact with each other and with the spindle . First , homologous chromosomes need to be - come connected through a link , which is provided by reciprocal recombination . Second , sister chromatid cohesion is modified such that it can be removed in a stepwise way : along the chromo - some arms in meiosis I and later at the centromeres in meiosis II . Third , the migration of sister chromatids to the same pole in meiosis I is accomplished through specific modifications of the kinetochores—the structure at the centromere that attaches to micro tubules ( Westermann et al . , 2007 ; Cheeseman and Desai , 2008 ) —such that both sister centromeres become attached to mi - crotubules emanating from the same pole ( also called co - or mono - orientation ) . In the search for factors supporting meiosis I specific segregation , proteins have been identified that specifically load on chromosomes during meiosis I to modify cohesion and the ways in which the kinetochores interact with microtubules . Among them , investigators have discovered the conserved cohesin Rec8 Monitoring Editor Kerry S .

After synapsis and the establishment of a recombination link be - tween the homologues , chromosomes transition out of prophase , a spindle forms , and centromeres begin to reattach to microtubules ( Figure 1A ) . It has been described that components of outer kineto - chores are shed from centromeres between the entry into meiosis and prophase I , but the precise timing and duration of this shed - ding , its coordination with other meiotic events , and the boundary between the shed and retained portions of the kinetochore were unknown ( Asakawa et al . , 2005 ; Miller , Ünal , et al . , 2012 ) . The re - lease of the outer kinetochore could be imagined to be the mecha - nism by which centromeres are released from their cluster at the SPBs . To explore this , we compared kinetochore disassembly dy - namics to the timing of centromere dispersion . We tracked simulta - neously a stable component of the kinetochore ( Mtw1 tagged with red fluorescent protein [ RFP ] ; Chuong and Dawson , 2010 ) and one protein that is known to be shed from the kinetochore ( Ndc80 tagged with green fluorescent protein [ GFP ] ; Kim et al . , 2013 ) . Using these two markers , we followed the cells from their entry ( T = 0 h ) into meiosis through prophase I ( T = 6 h ; Figure 1B ) . Cells were blocked from progressing beyond late prophase—pachytene—by deletion of NDT80 , which promotes exit from pachytene . Cells were categorized as having clustered , intermediate , or dispersed kineto - chores . When scoring the disposition of Ndc80 in these cells , we noticed several striking features . First , centromere dispersion and outer kinetochore disassembly started almost simultaneously as cells entered into meiosis ( Figure 1B ) . Second , cells with clustered centromeres always exhibited strong Ndc80 staining ( even at late time points ; Figure 1C ) . Thus we saw no evidence that Ndc80 shed - ding significantly precedes dispersion of the centromeres . At early time points , cells showing partial dispersion of centromeres often still showed partial Ndc80 staining , but later in meiosis , cells with partial dispersion of centromeres had very little detectable Ndc80 ( Figure 1 , B and D ) . Quantification of the Ndc80 - GFP fluorescence signals confirmed that in cells that do not release the kinetochore cluster upon transfer to meiosis - inducing ( sporulation ) medium , Ndc80 persists at the cluster and then gradually drops ( Supplemen - tal Figure S1 , A and B ) . These cells with persisting clusters may rep - resent those that remain in mitotic G1 and do not enter meiosis . In cells that exhibit dispersion of kinetochores , the Ndc80 fluorescence signal rapidly drops ( Supplemental Figure S1C ) . The results are con - sistent with the notion that Ndc80 is lost from different kinetochores at different times concomitant with dispersion of centromeres from the Rabl cluster . When the dispersion of centromeres was complete , in cells arrested in prophase I , we failed to observe any signal for Ndc80 ( Figure 1E and Supplemental Figure S1C ) . By pachytene , ki - netochores have no detectable Ndc80 but retain Mtw1 ( Figure 1F ) . Tracking kinetochore components through meiotic prophase The shedding of Ndc80 raises questions about what other proteins are shed from the kinetochore , how this process is controlled , and the role of kinetochore shedding in meiotic chromosome behavior . To track more specifically the changes in kinetochore structure during the earliest stage of meiosis , we took advantage of recently described methods that allow the purification of largely intact ki - netochore particles from mitotic and meiotic yeast cells ( Akiyoshi , Sarangapani , Powers , et al . , 2010 ; Sarangapani , Duro , et al . , 2014 ) . We purified kinetochores from cells at meiotic entry and in late pro - phase . We used quantitative mass spectrometry to evaluate the relative levels of individual kinetochore proteins in the two samples , which would reveal the identities of proteins that were lost from ki - netochores upon progression through prophase . Briefly , Dsn1 , a ( Watanabe and Nurse , 1999 ; Watanabe et al . , 2001 ; Yokobayashi et al . , 2003 ; Chelysheva et al . , 2005 ; Tachibana - Konwalski et al . , 2013 ) , Moa1 from fission yeast ( Yokobayashi and Watanabe , 2005 ) , and the monopolin complex in budding yeast ( Toth , Rabitsch , et al . , 2000 ; Rabitsch , Petronczki , et al . , 2003 ) . In addition , impor - tant meiotic - specific roles in regulating these proteins have been identified for some non – meiosis - specific proteins ( such as Dbf4 - dependent protein kinase , Cdc5 kinase , casein kinase 1 ; Clyne et al . , 2003 ; Lee and Amon , 2003 ; Petronczki et al . , 2006 ; Lo et al . , 2008 ; Matos , Lipp , et al . , 2008 ) . The simple expression of these factors in mitotic cells allows some portion of the chromosomes to exhibit meiosis - like segregation patterns but does not support the full conversion from mitotic to meiotic attachment ( Watanabe and Nurse , 1999 ; Watanabe et al . , 2001 ; Yokobayashi and Watanabe , 2005 ; Monje - Casas , Prabhu , et al . , 2007 ; Miller , Ünal , et al . , 2012 ) . Therefore , beyond these changes , we can imagine that additional regulation is required to restructure the kinetochores . The kinetochore can be thought of as an assembly of subcom - plexes ( for detailed review , see Lampert and Westermann , 2011 ) . Briefly , the base of the kinetochore at the DNA interface includes a centromere - specific nucleosome and the Cbf3 complex . The Mif2 , Ctf19 , and Mtw1 complexes , each composed of multiple conserved components , provide the bridge to the outer kinetochore com - plexes ( Spc105 and Ndc80 ) that contact microtubules . The Cnn1 complex may provide a separate or alternate DNA - to – outer kineto - chore bridge ( Bock , Pagliuca , et al . , 2012 ; Schleiffer et al . , 2012 ; Malvezzi et al . , 2013 ) . In mammalian , chicken , and nematode mitosis , several of the outer kinetochore proteins are shed after chromosome segregation and then reassembled upon mitotic entry ( Howe et al . , 2001 ; Nabetani et al . , 2001 ; Hori et al . , 2003 ; Gascoigne and Cheeseman , 2011 ; Dorn and Maddox , 2012 ; Westhorpe and Straight , 2013 ) . This refreshment is required each cell cycle in order to maintain genetic integrity . This shedding and reassembly does not occur in yeast mi - tosis but does in meiosis , as it does in mammalian meiosis ( Asakawa et al . , 2005 ; Hayashi et al . , 2006 ; Parra et al . , 2009 ; Sun et al . , 2011 ) , perhaps to facilitate the conversion from a mitotic to a meiotic structure . Meiotic kinetochore shedding has been most extensively stud - ied in fission yeast , in which meiosis typically occurs in the zygote formed from two mating haploid cells . These studies revealed that three outer kinetochore complexes ( Ndc80 / Mis12 / Spc7 ) are shed upon meiotic entry and that this process is regulated ( at least in part ) by mating pheromone signaling ( Asakawa et al . , 2005 ; Hayashi et al . , 2006 ) . In budding yeast , outer kinetochore components , in - cluding the Nuf2 / Ndc80 complex , are also shed ( Asakawa et al . , 2005 ; Miller et al . , 2012 ; Kim et al . , 2013 ) , but the precise interface between the shed and maintained portions of the kinetochore is not known . Determining this interface will inform investigations into how the regulators of kinetochore shedding , which have not been identified for nonzygotic meioses , trigger this process . RESULTS Kinetochores undergo dynamic changes during meiotic prophase When yeast cells enter meiosis , centromeres are clustered near the single spindle pole body ( SPB ; Figure 1A ) . This cluster , termed the Rabl cluster , disperses as homologous chromosomes begin pairing ( Hayashi et al . , 1998 ; Jin et al . , 1998 ) . Approximately concomitant with the liberation of the centromeres from the SPBs , the chromo - somes begin a series of rapid telomere - led movements that are be - lieved to play critical roles in synapsis , detangling of chromosomes , 2988 | R . E Meyer et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell clustered kinetochores upon meiotic entry ( Supplemental Figure S2 , B and C ) , suggesting that there is no major loss of any of these com - ponents in the G1 phase that precedes meiotic induction . The inner / central kinetochore remains on chromosomes during meiotic prophase To find the interface between the shed and nonshed portions of the kinetochore , we monitored the presence of proteins from inner and central subcomplexes on prophase kinetochores . Previous work identified several proteins ( Ndc10 , Mtw1 , Ctf19 , Chl4 , and Iml3 ; Figure 2A ) that remain at kinetochores through meiosis ( Kamieniecki et al . , 2000 ; Marston et al . , 2004 ; Tsubouchi and Roeder , 2005 ; Gladstone et al . , 2009 ) . This suggests that the kinetochore – DNA interface and at least portions of the Ctf19 complex , which includes several subcomplexes , are not shed upon prophase entry . Indeed , immunofluorescence microscopy confirmed that when kinetochores are dispersed in prophase , Mif2 , Ndc10 , and Cnn1 , representing three subcomplexes that are near the DNA – kinetochore interface , remain with the kinetochores ( marked by Mtw1 ; Figure 2B ) . Using MS - SRM , we found that representatives of the COMA complex ( Figure 2 , C and D ) and other Ctf19 subcomplexes ( Figure 2 , C and E ) showed little variation in relative abundance in kinetochores component of the Mtw1 complex ( Figure 2A ) , was FLAG tagged , and affinity purification was used to purify kinetochores from cells immediately before the switch to meiosis - inducing medium or 7 h later in a prophase arrest ( ndt80 ) . Mitotic kinetochore particles puri - fied by this method contained almost all of the components of the complete kinetochore ( except the Cbf3 complex ; Akiyoshi , Saran - gapani , Powers , et al . , 2010 ) ) . We used mass spectrometry selective reaction monitoring ( MS - SRM ) for quantification of individual pro - teins in the purified kinetochore samples based on the liquid chro - matography - tandem MS measurement of specific peptides formed by digestion of those proteins with the protease trypsin ( see Materials and Methods ; Kinter and Kinter , 2013 ) . Quantities of each protein were normalized to the amount of Dsn1 seen in that experi - ment , and then the ratio of the amount of protein in late prophase versus meiotic entry was calculated . At the same time , we epitope tagged one or more representative components from each subcom - plex and used immunofluorescence microscopy as a second way to monitor kinetochore disassembly in prophase . The GFP epitope tags did not result in significant growth defects and did not cause detectable meiotic chromosome segregation defects ( Supplemen - tal Figure S2A ) . As with Mtw1 and Ndc80 ( Figure 1C ) , all epitope - tagged components of the mitotic kinetochore were present at the FIGURE 1 : Centromere repositioning and outer kinetochore disassembly .

Ndc80 mediates kinetochore – mi - crotubule interactions , and Spc105 has also been implicated in in - teracting with microtubules ( reviewed in Lampert and Westermann , 2011 ) . The Ndc80 and Spc105 complexes are anchored to the ki - netochore through interactions with the Mtw1 complex . The Mtw1 complex persists on kinetochores through meiotic prophase ( Figure 3A ) . Both components of the Spc105 complex were also found to remain on the kinetochores through meiotic prophase ( Figure 3B ) . In contrast , MS - SRM revealed that all four components of the Ndc80 complex were lost from kinetochores by the end of prophase I ( Figure 3C ) . The fact that ∼ 40 % of the original level of Ndc80 components remains with the kinetochores reflects the fact that upon meiotic induction , typically ∼ 30 – 40 % of the cells fail to enter meiosis and persist with clustered kinetochores ( Figure 1B and Supplemental Figure S1 ) . Immunofluorescence microscopy con - firmed the loss of the Ndc80 complex , although the four proteins of the complex do not all behave in the same way . In cells with dis - persed kinetochores , Ndc80 signal is virtually undetectable , whereas purified from cells at meiotic entry and late prophase . Our immuno - fluorescence microscopy ( Figure 2 , D and E ) and observations by others ( Marston et al . , 2004 ) supported this conclusion , although detection of components known to be at low levels on the kineto - chore ( Joglekar et al . , 2006 ) were difficult to monitor by fluores - cence microscopy ( e . g . , Ctf3 ) , highlighting the complementarity of the MS - SRM approach . A potential exception to the stability of the inner / central kinetochore could be the Nkp1 and Nkp2 proteins ( Figure 2E ) . These proteins were found at slightly lower levels in late prophase in the MS - SRM experiments but were not significantly un - derrepresented . Together these results suggest that the inner and most central kinetochore components are present on the kineto - chore throughout meiotic prophase . Of note , this includes the Cnn1 complex . This complex was recently defined as an alternative bridge that can tether the Ndc80 complex to the inner kinetochore / centro - meric DNA ( Nishino et al . , 2012 ; Schleiffer et al . , 2012 ; Malvezzi et al . , 2013 ) , although in mitotic cells it is most abundant in ana - phase . These results demonstrate that it is present at meiotic entry and remains on kinetochores throughout meiosis ( Supplemental Figure S2B and Figure 2B ) .

First , cyclin - dependent kinase ( CDK ) is required for pro - phase events , including DNA replication and completion of meiotic recombination ( Shuster and Byers , 1989 ; Xu et al . , 1995 ; Benjamin et al . , 2003 ) . We tested whether Cdc28 was required for meiotic centromere dispersion and kinetochore shedding by us - ing a conditional cdc28 - as1 mutant that is sensitive to ATP - analogue chemical inhibi - tors ( Bishop et al . , 2000 ) . The Cdc28 - as1 inhibitor ( 1NM - PP1 ) was added to the cul - tures at the time of meiotic induction at a dose ( 5 μM ) that blocks meiotic DNA repli - cation and progression beyond prophase 1 ( Benjamin et al . , 2003 ) . Inhibiting Cdc28 - as1 did not prevent dispersion ( Figure 4A ) or ki - netochore shedding ( Figure 4B ) , although both processes were somewhat slowed when Cdc28 - as1 was inhibited . As a second test , we monitored centromere dispersion and kinetochore shedding in cdc6 - md ( meiotic depletion ) mutants , in which CDC6 is placed under the control of the SCC1 pro - moter , which is largely silent in meiosis . The cdc6 - md mutants do not replicate their DNA but enter prophase nonetheless ( Hochwagen et al . , 2005a ; Brar et al . , 2009 ; Blitzblau et al . , 2012 ) . Although depletion of Cdc6 blocks both kinetochore dispersion and shedding in mitotic cells ( Kitamura et al . , 2007 ) , we saw no reduction in either in meiosis ( Figure 4 , C and D ) . Thus long - term dispersion and kinetochore shedding in meiotic cells are regulated differently than the brief , replication - dependent dispersion and shedding in mitotic cells . Consistent with this , we find that only the Ndc80 com - plex is shed in meiotic cells , whereas the Cdc6 - dependent short - term loss of mitotic kinetochores includes members of the Mtw1 and Ctf19 complexes as well ( Kitamura et al . , 2007 ) . Ipl1 / Aurora - B is necessary for the disassembly of outer kinetochore Previous work showed that in ipl1 mutants , centromeres fail to dis - perse from their cluster around the SPBs when cells enter meiotic prophase ( Meyer et al . , 2013 ) . The fact that Ipl1 is needed for cen - tromere dispersion suggests a model in which Ipl1 triggers disper - sion by promoting shedding of the Ndc80 complex . We tested this using the ipl1 - md allele , in which the IPL1 promoter is replaced with the CLB2 promoter , which is expressed in mitotic but not meiotic cells ( Grandin and Reed , 1993 ) . Indeed , in ipl1 - md cells , Ndc80 was retained on the clustered centromeres ( Figure 5A ) and present on pachytene kinetochores ( Figure 5B ) . To confirm that this effect was not restricted to Ndc80 , we also examined shedding of Spc24 and Dam1 ( component of Dam1 complex ) . For both , we did not observe any significant disassembly ( Figure 5 , C and D ) . When we used MS - SRM to evaluate the levels of a wide range of kinetochore compo - nents after meiotic entry ( T = 3 h ) in wild - type and ipl1 mutant cells , it was clear the Ndc80 components and also Nkp2 of the Ctf19 complex were stabilized on the kinetochore when Ipl1 was absent ( Figure 5E ) . There is less variation in the levels of many components Spc24 and Nuf2 persist as a nuclear haze ( Figure 3C ) . Western blots demonstrated that the levels of Ndc80 decline upon meiotic entry , as suggested by earlier work ( Miller , Ünal , et al . , 2012 ) . In contrast , Nuf2 , Spc24 , and Spc25 levels are more stable ( Figure 3D ) . Whether the shed Spc24 , Spc25 , and Nuf2 are later reincorporated into the meiotic kinetochores remains to be determined . Like the Ndc80 complex , Dam1 was not observed on dispersed prophase kineto - chores using fluorescence microscopy ( Figure 3E ) . We conclude that upon meiotic entry , there is a rather precise shedding of the Ndc80 complex from the outer kinetochore ( Figure 3F ) . Other complexes are found at about the same relative abundance in late prophase as at meiotic entry , although we cannot eliminate the possibility that the small changes we observed for some proteins ( increases in Mtw1 , decreases in Nkp1 , Nkp2 , and the Spc105 complex ) reflect real adjustments to the kinetochore as it converts from a mitotic to a prophase I structure . Mitotic and meiotic centromeres are regulated differently What is the regulatory mechanism that triggers the shedding of the mitotic outer kinetochore upon meiotic entry ? Yeast cells enter the mitotic cycle with centromeres clustered at the SPBs . The centro - meres disperse briefly in a manner that is dependent on DNA repli - cation ( Kitamura et al . , 2007 ) . We used two approaches to test whether meiotic centromere dispersion and kinetochore shedding FIGURE 4 : Blocking DNA replication does not block kinetochore disassembly .

E Meyer et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell contribute to one of the critical changes during meiosis I : the transition from a kinet - ochore that will support mitotic segregation to one constructed for separating homo - logues while keeping sister chromatids to - gether . The mitotic - to - meiotic conversion is mainly supported in budding yeast by load - ing of the monopolin complex onto the cen - tromere . This complex is composed of Hrr25 ( casein kinase 1 ) , Lrs4 , Csm1 , and Mam1 ( Toth , Rabitsch , et al . , 2000 ; Rabitsch , Petronczki , et al . , 2003 ; Petronczki et al . , 2006 ) . The monopolin subunits Csm1 and Lrs4 form a V - shaped complex that might act by cross - linking sister kinetochores by forming a molecular clamp that enforces their co - orientation to the same pole ( Corbett et al . , 2010 ; Corbett and Harrison , 2012 ) . Csm1 presents a conserved hydro - phobic surface patch that binds the kineto - chore protein Dsn1 , a subunit of the Mtw1 / MIND complex . The Ndc80 complex is dis - pensable for association of monopolin with the kinetochore ( Sarkar , Shenoy , et al . , 2013 ) . Dsn1 is also the interface for binding of the Mtw1 complex with Spc24 and Spc25 of the Ndc80 complex , although binding studies suggest that the N - terminus of Dsn1 interacts with monopolin and the C - termi - nus interacts with Spc24 / 25 ( Corbett et al . , 2010 ; Corbett and Harrison , 2012 ; Malvezzi et al . , 2013 ; Sarkar , Shenoy , et al . , 2013 ) . The close proximity of the monopolin and Ndc80 binding interfaces on the Mtw1 com - plex suggested to us that outer kinetochore shedding might expose the central kineto - chore , making it more accessible for loading of the monopolin complex . Once monopo - lin had loaded , this could be followed by Ndc80 complex reloading on the now re - modeled kinetochores . To test this idea , we monitored monopolin ( Mam1 - GFP ) loading in ipl1 - md mutants that never shed their kinetochores or ipl1 - as5 mutants , in which kinetochores are shed before Ipl1 - as5 is in - activated . In both scenarios , Ipl1 is inactive at the time of monopolin loading , but in one case , outer kineto - chores have been shed , and in the other they , have not . In these experiments , the Ndt80 transcription factor was placed under the control of an estradiol - inducible promoter ( Benjamin et al . , 2003 ) , allowing us to accumulate cells in late prophase and then synchro - nously release the cells out of prophase to monitor monopolin load - ing ( Figure 6A ) . In wild - type cells , after release from the prophase arrest , Mam1 begins to accumulate soon before spindle formation ( Supplemental Figure S3A ) and shows progressive colocalization with kineto - chores—from a dispersed nuclear signal , to partial colocalization with dispersed kinetochores , to nearly complete overlap with kinet - ochores on the metaphase spindles ( Figure 6 , B and C ) . To monitor the effect of failed kinetochore shedding on monopolin loading , we inactivated Ipl1 at meiotic entry ( ipl1 - md ) and then monitored Mam1 localization to kinetochores after release from the prophase upon meiotic entry in ipl1 mutants compared with what is observed in wild - type cells , leading us to wonder whether outer kinetochore shedding is accompanied by a global increase in the plasticity of the kinetochore structure that might be detected by more precise moni - toring methods than those used here . The disassembly of the outer kinetochore facilitates the incorporation of monopolin Why might yeast cells remove the outer kinetochore for an extended portion of meiosis but not mitosis ? One explanation is that whereas mitotic sister chromatids are juxtaposed as soon as they are pro - duced and thus are ready to be segregated , in meiosis , the pairing of the homologous partners to prepare them for segregation is a protracted enterprise . Eliminating outer kinetochores until homo - logues are paired prevents precocious segregation of unpaired partners ( Kim et al . , 2013 ) . Kinetochore shedding might also FIGURE 5 : Ipl1 / Aurora - B is necessary for outer kinetochore disassembly .

E Meyer et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell used ndc80 - md strains in which NDC80 is placed under the control of the CLB2 promoter and is therefore not expressed in meiotic cells . We showed previously , using the ndc80 - md mutation , that the lack of centromere dispersion in ipl1 - md mutants could be rescued by removing the outer kinetochore complex ( Meyer et al . , 2013 ) . The ndc80 - md mutation resulted in a strong rescue of monopolin loading in the ipl1 - md strain ( Figure 7B ; see representative cell in Supplemental Figure 6D ) . The much greater rescue of monopolin loading that is seen in the ipl1 - md mutants when Ndc80 is removed compared to when microtubules are destabilized suggests that even in the absence of kinetochore – microtubule associations , the Ndc80 complex can interfere with monopolin loading , possibly by obstructing access to the Mtw1 complex . This predicts that Ndc80 remains on the detached kinetochores after treatment with microtu - bule - destabilizing agents . To test this , we treated cells with beno - myl / nocodazole and identified those with dispersed kinetochores ( Supplemental Figure 7 ) . In these cells , we scored the localization of Ndc80 - GFP with individual dispersed Mtw1 - 3xmCherry foci ( Figure 7C ) . Cells were categorized as having either intermediate dispersion ( 3 – 5 Mtw1 foci ) or full dispersion ( 6 – 12 foci ) . In cells with intermedi - ate dispersion , most Mtw1 foci that had been released from the SPB showed colocalization with Ndc80 . With increased exposure time to the microtubule - destabilizing agents and in cells with greater dispersion , the level of colocalization was reduced ( Figure 7C ) . Together the results suggest that loss of kinetochore – microtubule attachments leads to the accumulation of kinetochores that lack Ndc80 . DISCUSSION By monitoring the global changes in kinetochore structure that oc - cur through meiosis I , we found that the Ndc80 complex disassem - bles from the kinetochores in budding yeast soon after meiotic entry and is only reloaded as cells are assembling the meiosis I spindle . This process has parallels to the loss of outer kinetochores in meiosis in fission yeast ( Nabetani et al . , 2001 ; Asakawa et al . , 2005 ; Hayashi et al . , 2006 ) and in mitosis in mammalian cells ( Gascoigne and Cheeseman , 2013 ) . Although there is kinetochore shedding in these situations , there are differences as well . Whereas only the Ndc80 complex is completely lost in budding yeast meiosis , in fission yeast , the Ndc80 , Mis12 / Mtw1 , and Spc7 / Spc105 complexes are lost ( Asakawa et al . , 2007 ) . Similarly , in mammalian mitosis , the com - plete KMN network ( Ndc80 , Mis12 , and KNL1 complexes ) is re - moved as cells exit mitosis and reloaded upon mitotic entry ( Gascoigne and Cheeseman , 2013 ) . Our results are also consistent with centromere dispersion being the result of loss of the outer kinetochores , but the presence of some Ndc80 of dispersed kinet - ochores demonstrates that complete disassembly of the outer kinetochore is not required for the release of a centromere from the Rabl cluster . We speculate that shedding the outer kinetochores may serve multiple purposes . First , shedding the outer kinetochores releases the centromeres from their tether to the SPBs , permitting the chro - mosomes to move freely during the rapid telomere - led chromo - some movements in prophase that promote normal pairing and alignment ( Conrad , Lee , et al . , 2008 ; Koszul et al . , 2008 ) . Second , the restriction of reassembly of the kinetochores until after the pachytene checkpoint is satisfied ensures that segregation never precedes completion of homologue synapsis and recombination . Finally , shedding of the outer kinetochore appears to help prepare kinetochores for the conversion from the mitotic to meiotic form by enabling monopolin to load more efficiently . A similar function was also suggested by a series of experiments with fission yeast , in arrest . The ipl1 - md mutants show normal kinetics of progression from prophase through metaphase ( Jordan et al . , 2009 ) , but inacti - vation of Ipl1 causes some cells to form spindles precociously , in prophase ( Shirk et al . , 2011 ; Kim et al . , 2013 ; Newnham , Jordan , et al . , 2013 ) . Thus spindle formation alone is an unreliable marker for progression to metaphase in ipl1 - md mutants . These precocious prophase spindles appear before Mam1 accumulates to detectable levels ( Supplemental Figure S3 , A and B ) . Thus , in our analysis of ipl1 mutants , we excluded those cells with bipolar spindles but without detectable Mam1 . In the ipl1 - md mutants , the kinetochores are nearly always associated with the SPBs ( Meyer et al . , 2013 ; Figure 6E ) . When we quantified the association of Mam1 with kinetochores in the ipl1 - md strain , it was much reduced compared with the wild - type control ( Figure 6D ) : instead of localizing with kinetochores , Mam1 showed a more general nuclear localization and in some cases an intense focus of staining that did not colocalize with the kinetochores ( Figure 6E and Supplemental Figure S5 ) . One explana - tion for the apparent defect in the ipl1 - md mutants in loading mo - nopolin is that the activity of Ipl1 might be necessary for efficient monopolin loading . To test this , we allowed outer kinetochores to be shed due to the presence of functional Ipl1 - as5 and then inacti - vated Ipl1 - as5 concomitant with the release from prophase ( Figure 6A ) . In this regime , when Ipl1 - as5 was inactivated after kinetochore shedding , monopolin loading occurred at near - wild - type levels ( Figure 6D ) . To confirm the apparent loss of colocalization of Mam1 with kinetochores in the ipl1 - md mutants , we quantified the amount of Mam1 - GFP fluorescence signal that overlapped the kinetochore ( Mtw1 - RFP ) signal in mutants with either early inactiva - tion or late inactivation of Ipl1 ( Supplemental Figure S5 ) . Early loss of Ipl1 activity significantly reduced loading of Mam1 onto kineto - chores . We have not tested whether the loading of other monopo - lin subunits is diminished in ipl1 - md mutants . Together these approaches demonstrate that Ipl1 is dispensable for Mam1 load - ing after the release from prophase I and suggest that the deficiency of ipl1 - md mutants in loading Mam1 ( Figure 6D ) must reflect a prophase function for Ipl1 . We imagine two different ways in which Ipl1 activity in prophase might promote monopolin loading . First , Ipl1’s releasing of kineto - chore - microtubule attachments might allow monopolin to load onto kinetochores . This possibility is suggested by the observation that when monopolin is expressed ectopically in mitotic cells , higher lev - els of meiosis I – like segregation are observed if microtubules are briefly depolymerized before mitosis ( Miller , Ünal , et al . , 2012 ) . Sec - ond , removing the outer kinetochore might directly improve acces - sibility of the Mtw1 complex for association with monopolin , inde - pendently of kinetochore – microtubule association . To study the relative effect on monopolin loading of removing either kineto - chore – microtubule interactions or the Ndc80 complex ( and there - fore any Ndc80 complex – mediated microtubule interactions as well ) , we used two complementary strategies . The first one dis - rupted kinetochore – microtubule associations ( Figure 7A ) . The sec - ond approach was to remove the Ndc80 outer kinetochore complex ( ndc80 - md ; Figure 7B ) . For the first approach , we used a combined treatment with benomyl and nocodazole that efficiently destabilized microtubules ( Supplemental Figure 6 , A – C ) . The ipl1 - md cells , which do not shed outer kinetochores and exhibit persistent kinetochore – microtubule attachments , were released from a prophase arrest for 2½ h ( corresponding to the time with maximum loading of Mam1 ; Figure 6 , B and D ) in the presence or absence of microtubule - depo - lymerizing drugs . Treatment with microtubule - destabilizing agents resulted in a small but significant increase in monopolin loading ( Figure 7A ) . To test the effect of removing the outer kinetochore , we Volume 26 September 1 , 2015 Meiotic kinetochore restructuring | 2995 FIGURE 7 : Release of kinetochore – microtubule associations and shedding of outer kinetochores allow monopolin loading .

Molecular Biology of the Cell the cross - bridging of Mtw1 complexes originating from the two sis - ter kinetochores . To avoid premature bipolar attachment of the sis - ter chromatids , this cross - bridging needs to occur before the chro - mosomes reattach . Thus we speculate that Ndc80 complexes only reload on kinetochores when the foundation of the kinetochore is already modified . Although there are clear similarities in kinetochore restructuring among different organisms , the regulation shows some clear differ - ences . Ipl1 is required for the shedding of outer kinetochores upon meiotic entry but appears dispensable for reassembly in meiotic prometaphase . Conversely , CDK seems to play minor roles in ki - netochore shedding ( its role in reassembly is not known ) . In contrast , in mammals , mitotic shedding seems to require CDK activity ( Gascoigne and Cheeseman , 2013 ) , and reassembly is promoted by Aurora kinase ( Emanuele et al . , 2008 ) . In budding yeast , an obvious unanswered question involves the different behaviors of outer ki - netochores in meiosis and mitosis . Ipl1 is present in mitotic cells , yet there is no long - term loss of the outer kinetochores . How is this behavior restricted to meiotic prophase ? Our results also demonstrate that throughout meiosis , the inner - central kinetochore components stay on the kinetochore . As sug - gested by previous work ( Brar and Amon , 2008 ) , by remaining on the chromosome , these complexes probably serve as a platform for multiple centromeric functions . These include centromere coupling and pairing ( Kemp et al . , 2004 ; Mehta et al . , 2014 ) , centromeric crossover repression ( Lambie and Roeder , 1986 ) , and centromeric DNA replication and pericentromeric cohesion establishment ( Ghosh et al . , 2004 ; Marston et al . , 2004 ; Fernius and Marston , 2009 ; Fernius et al . , 2013 ; Eckert et al . , 2007 ; Ng et al . , 2009 ; Natsume et al . , 2013 ) . These results suggest that the Ndc80 complex is dis - pensable for these functions . Indeed , Ctf19 / COMA and Iml3 / Chl4 subcomplexes have been shown to be critical for the particular role of establishing pericentromeric cohesion , and we find that these persist on kinetochores through meiosis I . It will be interesting to determine whether outer kinetochore shedding is necessary for the proper execution of some of those meiotic centromeric functions . MATERIALS AND METHODS Yeast strains and culture conditions The strains used in these experiments are isogenic derivatives of two strains termed X and Y , which are rapidly sporulating strains from primarily S288C and W303 ancestry , derived in the R . E . Esposito , University of Chicago , laboratory ( Dresser et al . , 1994 ) . Strain genotypes are listed in Supplemental Tables S1 and S2 We used standard yeast culture methods ( Burke et al . , 2000 ) . To induce meiosis , cells were grown at 30°C until saturation and switched in yeast extract / peptone ( YP ) - acetate at ∼ 2 × 10 6 cells / ml , grown to ( 4 – 4 . 5 ) × 10 7 cells / ml , and then shifted to 1 % potassium acetate at 10 8 cells / ml . The inhibitor of Cdc28 - as1 ( 1NM - PP1 ; Calbiochem , San Diego , CA ; 5 mM stock in dimethyl sulfoxide [ DMSO ] ) was added when indicated at a concentration of 5 μM . For disrupting kinetochore – microtubule associations , benomyl ( # 45339 ; Sigma - Aldrich , St Louis , MO ) was used alone at 120 μg / ml ( Hochwagen et al . , 2005b ) or in combination with nocodazole ( # M1404 ; Sigma - Aldrich ; 30 μg / ml for benomyl and 15 μg / ml for nocodazole ) , as previously described ( Fernius and Marston , 2009 ) . Strain construction PCR - based methods were used to create complete deletions of open reading frames ( ndt80 : : LEU2 ) , epitope tags ( DAM1 - yeGFP - TRP1 , MAM1 - yeGFP - TRP1 , SPC24 - yeGFP - TRP1 , NUF2 - yeGFP - TRP1 , NDC80 - eGFP - TRP1 , NSL1 - yeGFP - TRP1 , DSN1 - yeGFP - TRP1 , which ectopic meiosis was induced by inactivation of the Pat1 ki - nase ( Yamamoto and Hiraoka , 2003 ; Chikashige et al . , 2004 ; Asakawa et al . , 2005 ; Hayashi et al . , 2006 ) . Under these conditions , the Ndc80 complex was found to remain on the kinetochores in - stead of being shed , and the centromeres remain associated with the SPB ( instead of being released ) . Of interest , in the first meiotic division , the sister chromatids split ( instead of staying together until the second division ) , consistent with the possibility that outer kinet - ochore shedding is important for the conversion from a mitotic to meiotic kinetochore region in fission yeast as well . Experiments in budding yeast have also addressed the role played by kinetochore – microtubule attachments and outer kineto - chore shedding in monopolin loading . The expression of the B - type cyclin Clb3 is normally restricted to meiosis II , but when it is ectopically expressed early in meiosis I , cells exhibit premature at - tachments of kinetochores to microtubules and reduced loading of monopolin on kinetochores . This reduced loading could be res - cued by disrupting kinetochore – microtubule associations ( Miller , Ünal , et al . , 2012 ) , suggesting a model in which one function of outer kinetochore shedding in early meiosis is to prevent persisting or premature kinetochore – microtubule attachments , which could block monopolin loading . We propose an additional function of shedding : facilitating the access of the monopolin more - interior parts of the kinetochore ( e . g . , the Mtw1 complex ) by “opening” the kinetochore structure . Of course , these two processes are re - lated : releasing kinetochore – microtubule connections appears to promote the loss of Ndc80 from the kinetochore ( Figure 7C ) , and removing Ndc80 results in a loss of microtubule attachments . Another reason that cells might shed the Ndc80 complex is to prevent the precocious association of kinetochores with microtu - bules before the homologous chromosomes have fully aligned with their homologous partners . An apparent contradiction to this idea is that Spc105 / KNL1 complex might have some ability to associate with microtubules ( Cheeseman et al . , 2006 ) , and it remains on the kinetochore during prophase I . The Spc105 / KNL1 complex is insuf - ficient for mediating persistent kinetochore – microtubule attach - ments , however , as these are not seen in the absence of the Ndc80 complex ( Kim et al . , 2013 ) . Why then shed the Ndc80 complex and retain the Spc105 complex ? Previous work has shown that Spc105 / Spc7 is important for the association of Bub1 kinase with the kineto - chore ( London et al . , 2012 ; Shepperd et al . , 2012 ) . We speculate that retaining Spc105 might be important to promote the early loading of essential critical actors of the spindle checkpoint to promote and monitor the early stages of kinetochore – microtubule attachment . The Mtw1 / Mis12 / MIND complex also remained on kinetochores during prophase I . This complex has been defined as a central hub of the kinetochore , docking to centromeric chromatin and serving as a multivalent receptor for protein complexes that interact with mi - crotubules ( Ndc80 , Spc105 / KNL1 ) . More recently , it has been also described as a receptor for the monopolin complex ( Corbett et al . , 2010 ; Sarkar , Shenoy , et al . , 2013 ) . Taken together , our results and those of others ( Yamamoto and Hiraoka , 2003 ; Chikashige et al . , 2004 ; Asakawa et al . , 2005 , 2007 ; Hayashi et al . , 2006 ; Monje - Casas , Prabhu , et al . , 2007 ; Corbett et al . , 2010 ; Corbett and Harrison , 2012 ; Miller , Ünal , et al . , 2012 ; Sarkar , Shenoy , et al . , 2013 ) suggest the following model ( Figure 7D ) . Ipl1 / Aurora - B promotes the shed - ding of Dam1 / Ndc80 complexes upon meiotic entry . This partial disassembly of the KMN network serves two purposes . First , it releases centromeres from the SPBs , liberating chromosomes to re - position themselves in the homologous pairing process . Second , removing the Ndc80 complex exposes the Mtw1 complex . This then facilitates the loading of the monopolin complex and allows Volume 26 September 1 , 2015 Meiotic kinetochore restructuring | 2997 body ( rabbit anti - Zip1 ; SC 33733 , Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Dallas , TX ; 1 : 1000 dilution ) , and Ndc80 - eGFP with preadsorbed primary antibody ( chicken anti - GFP ; AB16901 , Chemicon / Millipore ; 1 : 500 dilution ) . Secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 488 – conjugated goat anti - chicken , Alexa Fluor 568 – conjugated goat anti - mouse , and Alexa Fluor 647 – conjugated goat anti - rabbit ( all from Molecular Probes , Grand Island , NY ; dilution 1 : 1000 ) . Kinetochore protein purification Kinetochore particle isolation was carried out by affinity purifying Dsn1 - 3XFLAG using a purification protocol adapted from Sue Biggin’s lab ( Akiyoshi , Sarangapani , Powers , et al . , 2010 ) . Diploid cells were grown in YP - adenine / dextrose overnight at 30°C until saturation , switched to YP - acetate for presporulation , and finally shifted into 1 % potassium acetate at 10 8 cells / ml . Samples were harvested at the desired time points . Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation . Pellets were washed once with distilled , deionized H 2 O supplemented with 0 . 2 mM PMSF and repelleted . To prepare cell lysates , equal volumes of zirconium oxide beads and buffer H / PI / PI ( Akiyoshi , Sarangapani , Powers , et al . , 2010 ) were added to the cell pellet . Cells were homogenized in a Blue Bullet Blender 50 ( Averill Park , NY ) for 15 min at speed 10 in the cold ( 4°C ) and then put on ice for 5 min and homogenized for an additional 6 min . The supernatant was then transferred to a Beckman centri - fuge tube ( Ultra - Clear , 344057 ; Brea , CA ) . Ultracentrifugation was done at 24 , 000 rpm for 90 min at 4°C in an SW55ti Beckman rotor . Clear extract was isolated with a syringe needle inserted through the tube wall at the bottom of the clear layer . A 60 - μl amount of homogeneously suspended Dynabeads coupled to protein G ( # 100 . 04D ; LifeTech , Grand Island , NY ) was washed twice with citrate phosphate buffer , pH 5 . 0 . A 30 - μl amount of anti - FLAG M2 ( F1804 ; Sigma - Aldrich ) diluted in 70 μl of PBS / Tween ( PBST ) , pH 7 . 4 , was then added to the washed beads and incubated overnight at 4°C with gentle rotation . Beads were washed twice with PBST and once with buffer H / 0 . 15 ( 25 mM 4 - ( 2 - hydroxyethyl ) - 1 - piperazineethanesulfonic acid , pH 8 . 0 , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid , 0 . 1 % NP - 40 , 150 mM KCl , 15 % glycerol ; Akiyoshi , Sarangapani , Powers , et al . , 2010 ) . Finally , cell extract ( ∼ 4 ml ) was added to the beads and incubated at 4°C for 4 h . Beads were then washed four times with buffer H / 0 . 15 supplemented with protease inhibitors ( 10 μl / ml leupeptin , 10 μl / ml pepstatin , 10 μl / ml chymostatin , 0 . 2 mM PMSF ) , phosphatase inhibitors ( 1 mM sodium pyrophos - phate , 2 mM Na - β - glycerophosphate , 0 . 1 mM NA 3 VO 4 , 5 mM NaF , 100 mM microcystin - LR ) , and 2 mM dithiothreitol ( DTT ) and twice with buffer H / 0 . 15 containing protease inhibitors . Finally , associated proteins were eluted off the beads with ∼ 55 μl of elution buffer ( 0 . 5 mg / ml 3XFLAG peptide in buffer H / 0 . 15 with protease inhibi - tors added ) . Mass spectrometry The eluate containing the purified kinetochores was mixed with 8 pmol of bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) as an internal standard in 50 μl of 1 % SDS . The sample was heated at 80°C for 15 min to equilibrate and cooled to room temperature , and 1 ml of ice - cold acetone was added to precipitate the protein overnight . The pre - cipitated protein was pelleted by microcentrifuge at 10 , 000 × g for 10 min , the supernatant gently poured away , and residual acetone removed in a SpeedVac . The protein pellet was dissolved in 20 μl of Laemmli buffer containing DTT and heated at 80°C for 15 min . The entire sample was loaded into a 12 . 5 % Criterion Gel ( Bio - Rad , Her - cules , CA ) and the gel run for 15 min at 150 V . This short - run gel MTW1 - GFP - URA3 , CNN1 - yeGFP - TRP1 , CTF19 - yeGFP - TRP1 , CTF3 - yeGFP - TRP1 , CHL4 - yeGFP - TRP1 , NDC10 - yeGFP - TRP1 , MIF2 - yeGFP - TRP1 ) , and promoter insertions ( natNT2 : : P GAL1 - NDT80 , KanMX : : P GAL1 - NDT80 ; Longtine et al . , 1998 ; Janke et al . , 2004 ) . The MTW1 - 3xmCherry - hphNT1 , P GPD1 - GAL4 ( 848 ) - ER - URA3 : : hphNT1 , SPC42 - DsRed - URA3 , P CLB2 - 3HA - NDC80 ( ndc80 - md ) , P CLB2 - 3HA - IPL1 ( ipl1 - md ) , and ipl1 Δ KAN : ipl1 - as5 - MYC : HIS3 : LEU2 ( ipl1 - as5 ) strains were described previously ( Meyer et al . , 2013 ) . The cdc28 - as1 strain was constructed by two - step gene replacement ( Burke et al . , 2000 ) using OPL148 . OPL148 was built by ligating cdc28 - as1 ( excised from pDrive - cdc28 - as1 , a gift from the Haase lab , Duke University ) into pRS406 . cdc28 - as1 was cloned into the pDrive vec - tor by Laura Simmons Kovacs , Duke University , using a strain from David Morgan’s laboratory , University of California , San Francisco . Dsn1 - 3xFLAG was constructed using a PCR - based integration sys - tem with primers OPR693 , OPR694 , and template OPL167 ( p2L - 3XFLAG - kanMX , a gift from Toshio Tsukiyama , Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center ) . For the meiotic depletion of Cdc6 ( cdc6 - md ) , the P SCC1 - CDC6 strain was constructed by a one - step PCR - based gene replacement method using as a template KanMX6 - P SCC1 plasmid ( p502 ; a gift from Angelika Amon , Massachusetts Institute of Technology ) , which carries the mitosis - specific SCC1 promoter ( − 1000 to + 6 of the SCC1 gene ) . Generation and analysis of postpachytene cultures To examine postpachytene cells , we eliminated the asynchrony caused by the variation in timing of entry into the meiotic program by reversibly arresting cells in pachytene using an inducible allele of NDT80 ( Benjamin et al . , 2003 ; Carlile and Amon , 2008 ) . With the use of the P GAL1 - NDT80 GAL4 - ER system , cells were allowed to exit pachytene by addition of 5 μM β - estradiol ( Sigma - Aldrich ; 5 mM , stock in ethanol ) to the medium at 6 h . Inactivation of Ipl1 - as5 ( for the late inactivation ) was done by adding 50 μM of the inhibitor 1NA - PP1 ( Tocris , Minneapolis , MN ; 10 mM stock in DMSO ) to the medium at the same time . Fluorescence microscopy Images were collected using a Roper CoolSNAP HQ2 camera on a Zeiss Axio Imager 7 . 1 with a 100 × / 1 . 4 numerical aperture ( NA ) ob - jective or a Zeiss Axioplan 2ie fitted with a 63 × / 1 . 4 NA objective microscope . Images were processed and analyzed using AxioVision software . Gamma setting adjustments of the entire image were made to enhance the visibility of weak signals ( e . g . , GFP - and 3xm - Cherry - tagged kinetochore components ) . The localization of kineto - chore components tagged with GFP / RFP ( eGFP , yeGFP , or 3xm - Cherry ) were performed after fixing cells for 5 min in 2 % formaldehyde and washing one time in phosphate - buffered saline ( PBS ) . These cells were stained with 4 ′ , 6 - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole , washed once with PBS , and mounted for viewing . Meiotic nuclear spreads were prepared according to Dresser and Giroux ( 1988 ) with the following modifications . Cells were spheroplasted using 20 mg / ml Zymolyase 100T for ∼ 30 min . Spheroplasts were briefly suspended in MEM ( 100 mM 2 - ( N - morpholino ) ethanesulfonic acid , 10 mM EDTA , 500 uM MgCl 2 ) containing 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride ( PMSF ) , fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde plus 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 , and spread onto poly - l - lysine – coated slides ( Fisherbrand Superfrost Plus ) . Slides were blocked with 4 % nonfat dry milk in PBS for at least 30 min and incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies . In - direct immunofluorescence was performed to detect the following epitopes : Mtw1 - 13MYC with primary antibody mouse anti - MYC ( 9E10 ; a gift from Susannah Rankin , Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation ; 1 : 1000 dilution ) , Zip1 with preadsorbed primary anti - 2998 | R . E Meyer et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell electrophoresis moved the proteins ∼ 1 . 5 cm into the gel with some separation . The gel was fixed with 50 % ethanol / 10 % acetic acid in water for 30 min , equilibrated into water , and stained briefly ( 5 min ) to visualize the proteins . The gel was then soaked in water overnight with several changes to wash away all salts and the 3XFLAG peptide . Each lane was cut from the gel as a single sample . These large gel pieces , ∼ 1 . 5 cm × 0 . 7 cm , were cut into 10 – 12 smaller pieces and completely destained in 50 % ethanol / 10 % acetic acid in water at 50°C with multiple changes as needed . The proteins were reduced with DTT ( 10 mM ) and alkylated with iodoacet - amide ( 50 mM ) before digestion with 1 μg trypsin ( Promega , Madison , WI ) in 200 μl of 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate over - night at room temperature . The peptides produced by the diges - tion were extracted from the sample with 2 × 200 μl of 50 % meth - anol / 10 % formic acid in water . The extracts were evaporated to dryness in a SpeedVac and reconstituted in 50 μl of 1 % acetic acid for the LC - tandem MS analysis . The samples were analyzed on an LTQ - Vantage triple quadru - pole mass spectrometer system ( ThermoScientific , Tewksbury , MA ) coupled to an Eksigent NanoLC . A 10 cm × 75 μm reversed - phase column was used ( self - packed with Phenomonex Jupiter C18 ) . The column was eluted by a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0 . 1 % formic acid ( 3 – 43 % in 40 min ) at 150 nl / min . The mass spectrometer was operated in the selected reaction ( SRM ) mode , recording the elution of 62 peptides for 21 proteins , including the BSA internal standard and two trypsin autolysis peptides . Time scheduling was used to help maximize the dwell time . The specific peptides that were moni - tored were determined by a series of method development experi - ments designed to use the three peptides that gave the best re - sponse for each protein ( Kinter and Kinter , 2013 ) . The three peptides that were monitored to estimate the abundance of each kinetochore protein monitored are listed in Supplemental Table S3 . Overall a single multiplexed assay monitored 419 reactions for the 62 pep - tides used to determine the amounts of these proteins . The pro - gram Pinpoint was used to integrate the chromatographic peak area for all peptides . Representative chromatographic peaks for each peptide are shown in Supplemental Figure S4 . Data were analyzed by using the total area of all peptides for a given protein to calculate the total protein response ( Kinter and Kinter , 2013 ) . These responses were normalized to the response for Dsn1 , with normalization to the BSA used as confirmation . Western blots Cells harvested from meiotic time courses ( 1 ml / time point ) were disrupted in cold 16 . 6 % trichloroacetic acid in a Bullet Blue Blender following the manufacturer’s instructions . Protein precipitates were washed in 95 % ethanol , pelleted in a microcentrifuge , and resus - pended in SDS - PAGE buffer . Equal volumes of each sample were loaded on the gel . Blotted proteins were detected using primary antibodies against PGK1 ( 22C5 ; Molecular Probes ; 1 : 10 , 000 ) and GFP ( 12600500 ; Roche , Basel , Switzerland ; 1 : 2000 ) .
