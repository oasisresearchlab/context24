L E T T E R S Reconstitution of clathrin - coated bud and vesicle formation with minimal components Philip N . Dannhauser 1 and Ernst J . Ungewickell 1 , 2 During the process of clathrin - mediated endocytosis an essentially planar area of membrane has to undergo a gross deformation to form a spherical bud . Three ways have been recognized by which membranes can be induced to transform themselves locally from a planar state to one of high curvature : a change in lipid distribution between the leaﬂets , insertion of a protein into one leaﬂet and formation of a protein scaffold over the surface 1 . Such a scaffold is spontaneously generated by clathrin 2 – 5 . Conjectures that the attachment of clathrin was the cause of the change in curvature were challenged on theoretical grounds 6 , and also by the discovery of a number of clathrin - associated proteins with the capacity to induce membrane curvature 7 – 9 . We have now developed a cell - free system that has enabled us to demonstrate that clathrin polymerization alone is sufﬁcient to generate spherical buds in a membrane . This process is reversible , as shown by the reassimilation of the buds into the planar membrane when the intra - clathrin contacts are dissociated by the chaperone Hsc70 . We further show that the ﬁnal step in the formation of coated vesicles ensues when clathrin - coated buds are released through the action of dynamin . To determine whether the formation of polyhedral clathrin lattices on a membrane lipid bilayer surface can deform that membrane from a state of low curvature into one of high curvature , in the form of buds , we designed an experimental system based on large liposomes ( ≤ 100 µ m ) composed of whole brain lipids with a small added proportion of the nickel - chelating lipid Ni 2 + - NTA - DOGS . This allowed the attachment of a polyhistidine - tagged epsin 1 fragment ( H 6 - (cid:49) ENTH - epsin 144 – 575 ) . This epsin domain comprises the constitutively disordered 144 – 575 segment , whichharboursatypeI ( 480 LVDLD ) andatypeII ( 257 LMDLA ) clathrin - box motif 10 . The type II motif in epsin is related to the W - box motif , a clathrin - binding sequence found in amphiphysin 10 . H 6 - (cid:49) ENTH - epsin 144 – 575 also contains numerous AP2 - binding sites 11 but lacks , however , the compactly folded ENTH domain that can bind and tubulate phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate - containing 1 Department of Cell Biology , Centre of Anatomy , Hannover Medical School , Carl - Neuberg Str . 1 , D - 30625 Hannover , Germany . 2 Correspondence should be addressed to E .

The final component of the assay was highly purified clathrin ( Supplementary Fig . S1 ) . Specific binding of H 6 - (cid:49) ENTH - epsin 144 – 575 to Ni 2 + - NTA - DOGS liposomes alone through its polyhistidine tag was demonstrated by a sedimentation assay ( Fig . 1a , conditions 2 and 3 ) . In this assay , clathrin sedimented only with H 6 - (cid:49) ENTH - epsin 144 – 575 - containing liposomes , highlighting the specificity of the membrane association of clathrin ( Fig . 1a , condition 9 ) . In slightly acidic media H 6 - (cid:49) ENTH - epsin 144 – 575 is known to support efficient assembly of clathrin into polyhedral shells aslongastheclathrinconcentrationexceeds1 . 6 µ M ( ref . 12 ) . Instriking contrast , binding of clathrin to H 6 - (cid:49) ENTH - epsin 144 – 575 - coated liposomes proceeds already quantitatively at clathrin concentrations as low as 0 . 28 µ M ( data not shown ) . We routinely used 0 . 47 µ M clathrin at which only a small amount of clathrin was precipitated whether alone or in the presence of H 6 - (cid:49) ENTH - epsin 144 – 575 in the reaction mixture ( Fig . 1a , conditions 4 and 7 ) . For morphological and functional studies a two - stage binding assay was adopted in which H 6 - (cid:49) ENTH - epsin 144 – 575 was bound first to the liposomes . Clathrin was added to the liposomes after the removal of excess H 6 - (cid:49) ENTH - epsin 144 – 575 by centrifugation . Electron micrographs of negatively stained liposomes incubated with clathrin at 4 ◦ C showed extended and essentially flat hexagonal arrays covering the surface of the liposome ( Fig . 1b ) . Close inspection of the images reveals lattice imperfections ( Fig . 1b , inset ) , implying that nucleation of clathrin coat formation occurred simultaneously at several locations on the liposomes resulting in fault lines where the growing clathrin lattices abutted . Analysis of the coated liposomes by SDS – polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( SDS – PAGE ) and densitometry of Coomassie - stained electrophoretic gels ( Supplementary Fig . S2 ) indicates that on average about two H 6 - (cid:49) ENTH - epsin 144 – 575 molecules are required for the attachment of a clathrin triskelion to the liposome surface . We observed more efficient assembly of clathrin on the surface of the liposomes when compared with its assembly in solution ( see above ) .

The graph represents the normalized ratio of budded versus ﬂat proﬁles measured in nanometres of clathrin - coated membranes . To this end , coated membrane proﬁles in ultrathin sections of plastic - embedded liposomes were measured . Liposomes from two - stage incubations with H 6 - (cid:49) ENTH - epsin 144 – 575 and clathrin were used . The 4 ◦ C column represents liposomes that were coated with clathrin for 30min at 4 ◦ C ( n = 82 ) . The 4 → 37 ◦ C column represents liposomes coated with clathrin at 4 ◦ C and then shifted for 30min to 37 ◦ C ( n = 163 ) . The 37 ◦ C column represents liposomes that were coated with clathrin at 37 ◦ C for 30min ( n = 157 ) . Error bars indicate the standard deviation . Scale bars , 200nm ( main images ) and 100nm ( insets ) . explained by the fact that the diffusion of the clathrin triskelia is largely restricted to two dimensions . The confinement of clathrin to the liposome surface can be considered as a type of molecular crowding that is expected to affect protein activity 13 . When the clathrin - coated liposomes were warmed to 37 ◦ C the flat lattices were replaced by numerous clathrin - coated buds ( Fig . 1c , d ) . After brief exposure to 37 ◦ C , clathrin - free zones surrounded the newly formed membrane buds ( Fig . 1c ) . The higher temperature increases membrane flexibility and affects the association / dissociation equilibrium of triskelia that dissociated from the planar lattice and thus can reassemble into polyhedral structures to support bud formation . Abundant bud formation also occurred when the H 6 - (cid:49) ENTH - epsin 144 – 575 - coated liposomes were incubated with clathrin at 37 ◦ C for 30min ( Fig . 1e ) . The buds were of almost uniform diameter ( 87 ± 10nm , total number of buds n = 250 ) . Observations of sections of plastic - embedded clathrin - coated liposomes , whether maintained at 4 ◦ C or warmed to 37 ◦ C , supported the conclusions from the negatively stained preparations ( Figs 1d inset and 2a , b ) . At low temperature a 30 ± 4nm ( number of measurements n = 23 ) thick clathrin coat almost enveloped most of the liposome ( Fig . 2a ) . Numerous buds and circular coated vesicular profiles were observed at physiological temperature ( Fig . 2b ) . Serial sectioning revealed that the latter were invariably connected to adjacent or underlying liposomes by narrow necks most often with a diameter between 30 and 50nm . Clathrin - coated bud formation could also be demonstrated in a one - stage assay where liposomes , H 6 - (cid:49) ENTH - epsin 144 – 575 and clathrin were incubated simultaneously ( Supplementary Fig . S3 ) . We also investigated AP180 as a clathrin liposome linker on the grounds that this is the most efficient of all clathrin assembly proteins as a result of its many clathrin - binding sites 14 , 15 , and because it was used before for nucleating clathrin on lipid monolayers 16 . AP180consistsofaglobularANTHdomain , whichbinds polyphosphinositides 16 , 17 , followed by a long constitutively disordered segment that is responsible for the clathrin assembly activity 15 . For our experiment we used the construct H 6 - (cid:49) ANTH - AP180 328 – 896 in which the ANTH domain is replaced by a polyhistidine tag 12 . Clathrin was indeed efficiently recruited by H 6 - (cid:49) ANTH - AP180 328 – 896 to liposomes ( Supplementary Fig . S4 ) . Electron micrographs of sectioned liposomes revealed an irregular coating of the liposomes at 4 ◦ C ( Fig . 2c ) . At physiological temperature it was evident that small clathrin baskets , completely devoid of any lipid bilayer , were responsible for the irregular surface coat of the liposomes ( Fig . 2d ) . Thus , H 6 - (cid:49) ANTH - AP180 328 – 896 is capable of both recruiting clathrin to the surface of liposomes and of inducing its assembly into small empty shells with an average diameter of 56 ± 5nm ( number of shells NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 14 | NUMBER 6 | JUNE 2012 635 © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

The insets show a magniﬁed view of the area outlined in the main image . Of note is the striking difference in the coat structure . In contrast to H 6 - (cid:49) ENTH - epsin 144 – 575 , which induces a very tight association of clathrin with the membrane , H 6 - (cid:49) ANTH - AP180 328 – 896 recruits and assembles empty clathrin baskets on top of the membrane . Scale bars , 200nm ( main images ) and 50nm ( insets ) . n = 29 ) , but failed entirely to couple clathrin assembly to membrane deformation . Possible reasons for the failure of the constitutively disordered H 6 - (cid:49) ANTH - AP180 328 – 896 to convert the energy of clathrin assembly into membrane deformation may be its hydrodynamic volume , which exceeds that of H 6 - (cid:49) ENTH - epsin 144 – 575 ( ref . 12 ) , and / or the different type and number of clathrin - binding motifs ( 12 ‘DLL’ motifs ) present in AP180 that might result in altered clathrin - binding affinities 15 . As two shorter versions of AP180 ( H 6 - AP180 329 – 746 and H 6 - AP180 490 – 746 ) also failed to support membrane budding when clathrin was added the second explanation seems more likely ( data not shown ) . It was previously reported that coated pits form when AP180 , AP2 and clathrin were added simultaneously to lipid monolayers 16 . However , this claim lacked unambiguous proof for the presence of a membrane in the bud . We also investigated the ability of full - length H 6 - AP180 and full - length H 6 - epsin 1 to form membrane buds on liposomes in the presence of clathrin . We observed that H 6 - epsin 1 supported formation of clathrin buds whereas H 6 - AP180 behaved similarly to H 6 - (cid:49) ANTH - AP180 328 – 896 in this assay ( Fig . 3 ) . The bulky head group of the Ni 2 + - NTA - DOGS lipid corresponds approximately to that of phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate . Although it is possible that the clustering of bulky lipid head groups can induce membrane curvature 18 the enrichment of Ni 2 + - NTA - DOGS lipid in the bud by virtue of its interaction with H 6 - (cid:49) ENTH - epsin 144 – 575 is insufficient to contribute significantly to the curvature of the bud . Given the size of the coated buds ( 80 – 100 nm ) on the liposomes , the stoichiometry between H 6 - (cid:49) ENTH - epsin 144 – 575 and clathrin triskelion of about two and the fact that at most three Ni 2 + - NTA - DOGS lipids can attach to a hexa - histidine tag 19 , it follows that the enrichment of Ni 2 + - NTA - DOGS lipids in a coated bud does not exceed 7 % of that required to transform a flat membrane into a 70nm vesicle ( see Methods for details ) . We next investigated whether membrane buds would retract on disruption of the interaction between clathrin triskelia by the uncoating protein Hsc70 and its co - chaperone auxilin 1 , which targets the Hsc70 to clathrin 20 . To increase the number of binding sites for auxilin 1 on the clathrin buds we additionally introduced purifiedAP2 , whichasacentraladaptorproteininendocytosisprovides binding sites for epsin , auxilin and clathrin 21 . On addition of clathrin to H 6 - (cid:49) ENTH - epsin 144 – 575 and AP2 - coated liposomes , normal buds formed at 37 ◦ C ( Fig . 4a , b ) . When the recombinant auxilin fragment ( GST – auxilin 547 – 910 ) , Hsc70 and ATP were added to the liposomes , only about 30 – 40 % of the clathrin , regardless of whether or not AP2 was present ( not shown ) , was released from the membrane ( Fig . 4e ) . The bulk of the clathrin together with AP2 remained tightly anchored to the membrane through H 6 - (cid:49) ENTH - epsin 144 – 575 . The released portion of clathrin molecules probably represents a fraction that is bound indirectly to the membrane by their interaction with triskelia that are 636 NATURE CELL BIOLOGY VOLUME 14 | NUMBER 6 | JUNE 2012 © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited .

As for coated vesicles in cells , uncoating of liposomes requires in addition to the dispersal of the clathrin coat also the release of adaptors from the membrane 22 . Electron micrographs of the liposomes , however , showed that Hsc70 had caused extensive disruption of the clathrin lattice . Only very rarely could we discern partial survival of lattice structure , as shown in Fig . 4c . Moreover , the clathrin - coated membrane buds typically observed in liposomes incubated at 37 ◦ C could no longer be seen , neither by negative staining nor in ultrathin sections of plastic - embedded liposomes ( Fig . 4c , d ) . Together , our results show that clathrin is not only capable of deforming membranes into highly curved buds but it is 11697 66 45 29 S 1 2 P S P Clathrin α and β adaptins Hsc70 b d e M r ( K ) a c Figure 4 Effect of Hsc70 and auxilin 1 on clathrin lattice structure and stability of membrane buds .

Theseconclusionsseemtocontradict a previous assertion 6 that the free energy of clathrin polymerization is insufficient to overcome the energy ( estimated 500 k B T ) required to convert a planar area of membrane into a bud unless adaptors and in particular membrane - bending proteins are present 23 . Our experimental data are compatible , on the other hand , with recent computer simulations of the assembly reaction , which led to a binding strength for the polymerization of triskelia into cages greater by two orders of magnitude 24 than that reported previously in ref . 6 .

Scale bars , 200nm ( b ) , 500nm ( c ) and 100nm ( inset in c ) . because we never observed appreciable release of coated vesicles with those procedures ( data not shown ) . To effect the separation of clathrin - coated buds from liposomes we turned to the large GTPase dynamin , which has long been implicated in the release of clathrin - coated pits from the plasma membrane in vivo 25 , 26 . Dynamin polymerizes on the surface of negatively charged liposomes into helical structures that distort the membrane into tubular forms 27 . On hydrolysis of GTP the conformation of the helix changes , resulting in constriction of membrane tubes or vesiculation , depending on experimental conditions 28 , 29 . Dynamin added to membranes in the presence of GTP leads to the continuous release of small dynamin - coated membrane vesicles from large liposomes 28 . We found conditions for minimizing membrane tubule formation by exploring a range of dynamin concentration in the presence of clathrin . When H 6 - (cid:49) ENTH - epsin 144 – 575 - coated liposomes were incubated simultaneously with clathrin and dynamin in approximately equal molar proportions at 4 ◦ C and shifted to 37 ◦ C in the presence of GTP for at least 5min significant amounts of clathrin were recovered from the pellet of the second of two consecutive centrifugation steps ( Fig . 5a ) . The first centrifugation step at low speed precipitated liposomes . Ultracentrifugation of the low - speed centrifugation supernatant allowed recovery of clathrin - coated vesicles . Aliquots of the products were analysed by SDS – PAGE ( Fig . 4a ) . Electron microscopy of the pelleted clathrin fraction confirmed the presence of bona fide coated vesicles ( Fig . 5b , c ) . In negatively stained preparations , small particles that are possibly dynamin - coated vesicles were seen together with clathrin - coated vesicles . Some of the latter displayed stalks that we take to be residual membrane from the neck regions . The release of clathrin - coated vesicles required incubations with GTP at physiological temperature . No release was observed in the absence of GTP or when GTP - γ S was substituted for GTP ( Fig . 5a ) . Dynamin - induced scission of clathrin - coated vesicles was also confirmed by electron microscopy in an assay especially designed to minimize shear stresses by avoiding pipetting and centrifugation of the reaction cocktail ( see Methods section for details and Supplementary Fig . S5 ) . The mechanism of dynamin - induced clathrin - coated vesicle generation from coated buds can be readily explained by the ability of dynamin to act as a scission catalyst in the presence of GTP ( ref . 29 ) . This reaction may occur stochastically sparing only clathrin - protected buds , which are released as coated vesicles ; otherwise , dynamin may act preferentially on the necks of budding vesicles because the local curvature of the bilayer in this region is most favourable for its attachment .

L E T T E R S outlined above recapitulates the fundamental steps of coated vesicle generation and now affords the means of examining systematically the relative contributions of endocytic accessory proteins , including those with membrane shaping activities , in this process . In vivo these proteins are required for the temporal and spatial control and undoubtedlytoenhancetheefficiencyofclathrin - mediatedendocytosis by synergistically supporting clathrin in transforming small patches of the plasma membrane into spheres . Our in vitro assay system has also demonstrated the ease with which clathrin can be used to coat surfaces with extended regular two - dimensional lattices ( Fig . 1b ) , opposed to lattices that close in on themselves to yield small coated membrane buds .

His - tagged epsin 1 , His - tagged epsin 1 lacking the ENTH domain ( H 6 - (cid:49) ENTH - epsin 144 – 575 ) , His - tagged AP180 and His - tagged AP180 lacking the ANTH domain ( H 6 - (cid:49) ANTH - AP180 328 – 896 ) from rat brain were expressed and purified as previously described 12 . GST – auxilin 547 – 910 was expressed and purified as described previously 20 . Hsc70 was purified from pig brain essentially as described elsewhere 30 . Clathrin and the AP2 adaptor protein both from pig brain were purified by gel filtration ( Superose 6 , GE Life Science ) , ion - exchange chromatography ( MonoQ , GE Life Science ) and hydroxyapatite chromatography 31 , 32 ( CHT ceramic hydroxyapatite type I , 40 µ m ) . Clathrin was stored in 10mM Tris – HCl , at pH8 . 0 , and AP2 in PBS . Dynamin was prepared from pig brain cytosol essentially as described elsewhere 33 . Traces of synaptojanin were eliminated by gel filtration ( Superdex 200 ; GE Life Science ) . The column was equilibrated in 20mM CHES ( N - cyclohexyl - 2 - aminoethanesulphonic acid ) at pH10 , 150mM NaCl , 2mMEDTAand 2mMdithiothreitol 33 . Dynamin wasstored in 20mM HEPES and 150mM NaCl , at pH7 . 4 . Preparationofliposomes . Brainpolarlipidextract ( BPLE ; Avanti ) containing5 % ( w / w ) Ni 2 + - NTA - DOGSlipid ( Avanti ) chloroformataconcentrationof10mgml − 1 chloroform was dried under a stream of argon . To remove residual chloroform the precipitate was further dried under vacuum in a desiccator for 15min . Liposomes were prepared by resuspending the lipids in 20mM HEPES , 100mM NaCl and 1mM MgCl 2 , at pH7 . 4 at a concentration of 5mgml − 1 . The suspension was kept at 37 ◦ C for at least 10min and intermittently vortexed . BPLE without Ni 2 + - NTA - DOGS lipid was prepared in the same way . A solid - phase liposome - binding assay 34 was used for some of the morphological experiments as detailed in the figure legends . Approximately 0 . 1 µ l BPLE with 5 % ( w / w ) Ni 2 + - NTA - DOGS lipid at a concentration of 3mgml − 1 in chloroform was carefully spotted on freshly glow - discharged carbon - coated formvar grids . Utmost care was taken to prevent direct contact between the chloroform and the formvar film . After drying in vacuo the grids were hydrated by incubation in 20mM HEPES , 100mM NaCl and 1mM MgCl 2 , at pH7 . 4 , at 37 ◦ C . Binding of proteins to liposomes . For the one - stage binding assay , H 6 - (cid:49) ENTH - epsin 144 – 575 ( 1 . 8 µ M ) and clathrin ( 0 . 7 µ M ) were incubated with 50 µ g liposomes with and without Ni 2 + - NTA - DOGS for 30min at 25 ◦ C in a final volume of 100 µ l buffer G ( 25mM HEPES , 125mM potassium acetate and 5mM magnesium acetate ; at pH 7 . 2 ) . Clathrin stocks ( 5 – 8 µ M ) were in 10mM Tris – HCl , at pH8 . 0 , to prevent clathrin polymerization into cages during storage . Soluble protein was separated from self - assembled or liposome - bound protein by ultracentrifugation for 15min at 90 , 000 g using a TLA - 55 rotor in a TL - 100 benchtop ultracentrifuge ( Beckman ) . Supernatant and pellet fractions were analysed by SDS – PAGE in gradient gels . Routinely a two - stage binding assay was used in which the anchor protein for clathrin ( H 6 - (cid:49) ENTH - epsin 144 – 575 or H 6 - (cid:49) ANTH - AP180 328 – 896 at 1 . 8 µ M ) was attachedtoliposomesfirst . Unboundproteinwasremovedbycentrifugationandthe resuspended liposomes were in the second stage incubated with clathrin ( 0 . 7 µ M ) either at 4 ◦ C or at 37 ◦ C as indicated in the text . For the binding of H 6 - AP180 ( ref . 12 ) , 12 . 5 µ g liposomes was incubated in 1 . 9mM KH 2 PO 4 , 8 . 2mM NaH 2 PO 4 , 137mM NaCl and 2 . 7mM KCl with H 6 - AP180 ( 0 . 3 µ M ) for 30min on ice in a total volume of 1ml . Unbound protein was removed by centrifugation at 2 , 900 g for 30min . The liposomes were subsequently incubated with clathrin ( 0 . 7 µ M ) for 20min at 37 ◦ C in 0 . 19ml buffer G . The liposomes were collected by centrifugation and processed for electron microscopy . In the case of H 6 - epsin 1 ( ref . 12 ) , 12 . 5 µ g liposomes were incubated with epsin ( 4 µ M ) in a total volume of 60 µ l and then incubated with clathrin as described above . Liposomesimmobilizedoncarbon - coatedformvargridswerewashedwithbuffer G containing 50 µ gml − 1 bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) and then incubated with H 6 - (cid:49) ENTH - epsin 144 – 575 . The grids were then placed on a 15 µ l droplet containing H 6 - (cid:49) ENTH - epsin 144 – 575 ( 1 . 8 µ M ) and incubated on parafilm for 30min at 4 ◦ C . Next unbound protein was removed by transferring the grids sequentially to two 20 µ l droplets containing buffer G and BSA . The grid was then transferred to a 15 µ ldroplet containing clathrin ( 0 . 7 µ M ) and BSA and incubated for 30min either at 4 ◦ C or at 37 ◦ C . Unbound clathrin was removed by sequential transfers to two 20 µ l droplets of buffer G . For the analysis of the effects of higher temperatures on clathrin lattices formed at 4 ◦ C , the washed grids were warmed to 37 ◦ C before processing the grids for electron microscopy . Hsc70 - induced uncoating of liposomes . H 6 - (cid:49) ENTH - epsin 144 – 575 - coated lipo - somes ( 0 . 5mg ) were incubated with AP2 ( 0 . 4 µ M ) in PBS for 30min at 25 ◦ C ( reaction volume 0 . 94ml ) to increase the number of binding sites for auxilin 1 ( ref . 35 ) . Coated liposomes were pelleted at 11 , 600 g for 20min at 4 ◦ C and resus - pended in buffer G and incubated with clathrin as above . For a typical uncoating experiment , the reaction mixture ( 75 µ l ) contained 60 µ g coated liposomes , 2mM ATP , 0 . 14 µ M GST – Auxilin 547 – 910 and 1 µ M Hsc70 . The reaction was allowed to proceedfor15minat37 ◦ Candthenstoppedbyadditionofhexokinaseandglucose ( Roche ) asdescribedelsewhere 20 . FortheanalysisbySDS – PAGEtheliposomeswere pelleted at 90 , 700 g for 15min at 4 ◦ C . Liposomes destined for ultrathin sectioning were pelleted at 6 , 000 g . Scission of clathrin - coated vesicles . H 6 - (cid:49) ENTH - epsin 144 – 575 - coated liposomes were centrifuged at 730 g , for 10min at 4 ◦ C to remove small liposomes . The pellet was resuspended in buffer G containing 0 . 1 % casein and then pre - incubated simultaneously with clathrin ( 0 . 43 µ M ) and Dynamin I ( 0 . 31 µ M for 30min on ice . Then the volume was quadrupled by adding buffer G containing 0 . 1 % casein and GTP to a final concentration of 2mM . Following an incubation for 30min at 37 ◦ C , large liposomes were separated from coated vesicles by centrifugation at 11 , 600 g for 10min at 4 ◦ C . Clathrin - coated vesicles were subsequently recovered from the supernatantbyultracentrifugationat90 , 700 g for25min . The11 , 600 g and90 , 700 g pellets were resuspended in buffer G containing 0 . 1 % casein . Coated vesicle release was quantified by SDS – PAGE and qualitatively analysed by electron microscopy . To quantify scission under low shear conditions by electron microscopy ( Supplementary Fig . S5 ) a 25 µ l droplet containing H 6 - (cid:49) ENTH - epsin 144 – 575 - coated liposomes , pre - incubated at 4 ◦ C with dynamin and clathrin , was applied to a sheet ofparafilm . AfterinjectionofGTP , acarbon - coatedformvarcoppergridwasplaced on the droplet . The parafilm was inverted and incubated at 37 ◦ C for 30min to allow scission of coated vesicles to occur . The copper grid was placed on a drop of 3 % glutaraldehyde and then negatively stained with 2 % uranyl acetate . Random views of the images were analysed by placing a virtual grid over the micrographs and determining the number of clathrin - coated particles ( buds or vesicles ) per 1 µ 2 square containing at least one particle . The rationale here is that the liberated buds would disperse as coated vesicles and consequently the separations of coated structures would increase . Electron microscopy . For negative staining of coated liposomes , freshly glow - discharged carbon - coated formvar grids were used . Typically , sample volumes between 5 and 10 µ l were applied to the grids and left there for 1min . The liposomes were fixed for 5min with 3 % glutaraldehyde ( Polyscience ) in buffer G , rinsed with 100mM MES , 1mM EDTA and 0 . 5mM MgCl 2 , at pH6 . 4 and then stained for 1min with 2 % uranyl acetate . Grids obtained from the solid - phase liposome - binding assay were fixed , washed and stained using the procedure described above . For ultrathin sectioning , liposomes were pelleted at 6 , 000 g , fixed with 3 % glutaraldehyde and further processed for embedding in Epon and staining as described previously 36 . Specimens were viewed with a Tecnai G2 ( FEI ) electron microscopeatanaccelerationvoltageof200kV . Digitalimageswereprocessedusing TIA software ( FEI ) , the public domain NIH ImageJ program and Adobe Photoshop . Microsoft Excel was used for all calculations including the s . d . SDS – PAGE . For optimal resolution of clathrin from other polypetides , 9 – 19 % polyacrylamide - gradientgelsoftheLaemmlitypewereused 37 . Thepercentageofthe N , N (cid:48) - methylene - bisacrylamide to acrylamide was C = 1 % for the 9 % acrylamide solution and C = 1 . 9 % for the 19 % solution . The gels were cast and run in a Mighty SmallIIMiniverticalelectrophoresisunit ( Hoefer ) for15minat70Vfollowedby1h at 200V at a constant temperature of 5 ◦ C . Proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie brilliant blue G - 250 . All reagents were of analytical quality and obtained from BioRad . The destained gels were photographed with a Coolpix 995 digital camera ( Nikon ) and the digital images were transferred to either Adobe Photoshop orNIHImageJ . Fordensitometricanalysisofstainedproteinzones , ImageJwasused . Assessment of the contribution of Ni 2 + - NTA - DOGS lipid head groups to bud formation . The area occupied by Ni 2 + - NTA - DOGS lipid in a monolayer corresponds to about 65Å 2 ( ref . 38 ) , which is about 1 . 6 - fold larger than the headgroupsofphosphatidylethanolamineorphosphatidylserine ( bothabout40Å 2 ; ref . 39 ) . The effect of the Ni 2 + - NTA - DOGS head group on membrane deformation is in our system negligible because the enrichment of the Ni 2 + - NTA - DOGS lipid is surprisingly small : ultrathin sectioning showed that the almost pinched coated buds have diameters between 80 and 100nm . The encapsulated vesicles measure 60 – 70nm . The structure of these coats resembles the ‘soccer ball type’ that is constructed from 60 triskelia 40 . Our stoichiometric analysis showed that there are onaveragetwoH 6 - (cid:49) ENTHepsinmoleculespertriskelion , amountingtoanaverage of 120 H 6 - (cid:49) ENTH epsin molecules per coated bud . As each hexa - histidine - tag can associate with up to 3 Ni 2 + NTA ( ref . 19 ) , this then yields 360 Ni 2 + - NTA - DOGS lipid molecules per average bud . The bilayer is about 40Å thick 39 . The difference in area between the outer and the inner monolayer of a 700Å vesicle is given by : 4 π r 2outer radius − 4 π r 2inner radius = 3 . 3 × 10 5 Å 2 . The360Ni 2 + - NTA - DOGSlipidmolecules account for an area of only 2 , 34 × 10 4 Å 2 , which accounts for only about 7 % of that required to transform a flat membrane into a 70nm vesicle .
