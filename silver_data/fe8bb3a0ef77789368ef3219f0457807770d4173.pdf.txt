ARTICLE Highly emissive excitons with reduced exchange energy in thermally activated delayed ﬂ uorescent molecules Anton Pershin 1 , David Hall 1 , 2 , Vincent Lemaur 1 , Juan - Carlos Sancho - Garcia 3 , Luca Muccioli 4 , Eli Zysman - Colman 2 , David Beljonne 1 & Yoann Olivier 1 Unlike conventional thermally activated delayed ﬂ uorescence chromophores , boron - centered azatriangulene - like molecules combine a small excited - state singlet - triplet energy gap with high oscillator strengths and minor reorganization energies . Here , using highly correlated quantum - chemical calculations , we report this is driven by short - range reorganization of the electron density taking place upon electronic excitation of these multi - resonant structures . Based on this ﬁ nding , we design a series of π - extended boron - and nitrogen - doped nanographenes as promising candidates for ef ﬁ cient thermally activated delayed ﬂ uores - cence emitters with concomitantly decreased singlet - triplet energy gaps , improved oscillator strengths and core rigidity compared to previously reported structures , permitting both emission color purity and tunability across the visible spectrum . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 08495 - 5 OPEN 1 Laboratory for Chemistry of Novel Materials , University of Mons , Place du Parc 20 , B - 7000 Mons , Belgium . 2 Organic Semiconductor Centre , EaStCHEM School of Chemistry , University of St Andrews , St Andrews KY16 9ST , United Kingdom . 3 Departamento de Química Física , Universidad de Alicante , E - 03080 Alicante , Spain . 4 Dipartimento di Chimica Industriale “ Toso Montanari ” , Università di Bologna , I - 40136 Bologna , Italy .

OLIVIER @ umons . ac . be ) NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 597 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 08495 - 5 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications 1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 89 0 ( ) : , ; T he discovery of purely organic thermally activated delayed ﬂ uorescence ( TADF ) materials , with its premise to break the spin statistical bottleneck of 25 % internal quantum ef ﬁ ciency without the requirement of rare noble metal emitters , has prompted a paradigm shift in the design of emitter materials for use in organic light - emitting diodes ( OLEDs ) 1 . TADF is rooted in a thermally promoted reverse intersystem crossing ( RISC ) process enabling upconversion of triplet excitons into emissive singlet excitons , which otherwise would be lost through non - radiative pathways . One key property TADF molecules should ful ﬁ ll for ef ﬁ cient RISC is a small energy gap between the lowest singlet and triplet excited states Δ E ST ( usually < 0 . 2 eV ) , so that delayed ﬂ uorescence can be thermally activated at room temperature ( though exceptions to this general rule exist that involve higher - lying triplet states ) 2 . The most widely applied design strategy so far is based on molecules featuring weakly coupled and spatially separated donor ( D ) and acceptor ( A ) moieties . This motif sustains charge - transfer ( CT ) excitations with small exchange interactions and correspondingly small Δ E ST compared to localized excited states 3 – 5 . However , this approach suffers from a number of drawbacks that directly re ﬂ ect the nature of the emissive excited state . In particular , achieving high photoluminescence quantum yields ( PLQY ) and color purity in conventional TADF molecule - based OLEDs has been challenging thus far 6 – 9 . As a consequence of their dominant CT character , the singlet electronic excitations in these molecules often display fairly small radiative emission cross - sections ( oscillator strengths , f osc ) . Hence , high PLQY in these materials is only possible through ef ﬁ cient suppression of non - radiative decay processes . Moreover , charge - transfer excita - tions are usually accompanied by large structural reorganization , associated with conformational degrees of freedom in D - A molecular architectures , leading to broad emission spectra . Yet , such conformational gating effects also feed small admixtures of local ( covalent ) excited - state character into ( primarily triplet ) CT ( ionic ) excitations , prompting the needed spin - orbit interaction that mediates spin conversion 10 – 13 . Thus , designing optimally performing TADF compounds in this scenario relies on the necessarily delicate balance between antagonistic effects . A notable departure from the usual strategy has recently been proposed by Hatakeyama et al . 6 , 7 , 14 who designed TADF emitters as triangulene cores incorporating ortho - substituted boron and nitrogen atoms to promote multiple resonance effects ( see chemical structures in Fig . 1 and resonant structures in Supplementary Fig . 5 ) . Unlike conventional D - A architectures , these boron - centered azatriangulenes yield concomitantly narrow emission spectra ( full - width at half - maximum = 28 nm ) , rela - tively large f osc ( ~ 0 . 2 for both DABNA - 1 and 2 ) and small Δ E ST ( ~ 0 . 15 eV for DABNA - 1 and 0 . 21 for 2 ) values . OLEDs with high maximum external quantum ef ﬁ ciencies ( EQE max ) of 13 . 5 % and pure blue emission [ CIE coordinates of ( 0 . 13 , 0 . 09 ] for DABNA - 1 were demonstrated . In marked contrast with experiment , recent publications 5 , 15 , 16 reported Time - Dependent Density Functional Theory ( TD - DFT ) Δ E ST predictions in the range 0 . 4 – 0 . 6 eV depending on functional , largely overestimating the experimental values . Based on these TD - DFT calculations , two mechanistic pictures for TADF in boron - centered azatriangulenes molecules have been put forward : Lin et al . 15 claimed that RISC occurs directly from T 1 to S 1 while Northey et al . advanced that RISC involves an intermediate higher - lying triplet state T 2 16 . Here , by scrutinizing the nature of the lowest electronic exci - tations in these molecules , we propose a new paradigm for TADF that builds on the concept of short - range charge - transfer illustrated in Fig . 1 . While long - distance charge separation in multichromophoric D - A systems reduces Δ E ST at the expense of f osc , we show that boron - centered azatriangulenes undergo a large but local spatial reorganization of the electronic density in the excited states , which signi ﬁ cantly lowers the exchange energy while maintaining high overlap between wavefunction tails and therefore high f osc transitions , together with small structural relaxation energies . Based on these results , we propose analogs that we hope will lead to high performance TADF emitters in OLED devices . Results Origin of small Δ E ST in DABNA molecules . We start our analysis with DABNA - 1 6 . Irrespective of the choice of the DFT functional and the use ( or not ) of the Tamm - Dancoff approx - imation , all our TD - DFT calculations yield erroneously large Δ E ST values ( e . g . , 0 . 56 eV at B3LYP level ) , in line with refs . 6 , 15 , 16 ( see Supplementary Table 1 ) . The use of tuned range - separated functionals does not help either . By varying the amount of Hartree - Fock - like exchange in the functional , we observe a smooth decrease of Δ E ST that reaches a more reasonable 0 . 25 eV with pure semilocal models ( e . g . , LDA ) , but at the cost of an unphysical delocalization of the electronic density over the outer phenyl rings ( Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . The discrepancy between experiment and theory has more fundamental grounds , as we discovered by running higher - level Spin - Component Scaling second - order approximate Coupled - Cluster ( SCS - CC2 ) calcula - tions with the def2 - TZVP basis set ( see SI for further details on these calculations ) . In contrast to TD - DFT , SCS - CC2 calculations on DABNA - 1 and compound 2 provide ( vertical , i . e . , based on ground - state geometry ) Δ E ST values in excellent agreement with experiments , Table 1 . Despite relatively small Δ E ST values ( < 0 . 2 eV ) , the lowest singlet electronic excitation in these molecules is strongly dipole - allowed with a f osc of 0 . 31 in DABNA - 1 and ( summing over the two degenerated singlet excited states arising from the C 3V - symmetry ) 0 . 26 in 2 . Most interestingly , similar Δ E ST values were obtained for vertical and adiabatic ( fully relaxed ) excitations , owing to modest nuclear reorganization energies in the S 1 state ( 0 . 12 eV and 0 . 10 eV for DABNA - 1 and molecule 2 , respectively , Table 1 ) , which should ensure narrow singlet emission as an added virtue .

Yellow ( blue ) color indicates increased ( decreased ) electron density upon S 0 - S 1 excitation ARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 08495 - 5 2 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | ( 2019 ) 10 : 597 | https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1038 / s41467 - 019 - 08495 - 5 | www . nature . com / naturecommunications The origin for the unusual electronic properties of these molecules is best pictured by difference density plots for the S 0 - S 1 and S 0 - T 1 excitations , calculated at the SCS - CC2 level and shown in Fig . 1b for DABNA - 1 ( cf . Supplementary Fig . 1 ) . These plots reveal a remarkably homogenous short - distance reshuf ﬂ ing of the electronic density upon excitation that yields spatially alternating hole - rich and electron - rich regions . The density reorganization is partly shaped by second - order electronic correlation effects ( Supplementary Fig . 2 ) and thus , not surprisingly , cannot be fully captured at the ( one - electron ) TD - DFT level . To elucidate further the origin for the small Δ E ST in DABNA - 1 and 2 , it is instructive to analyze the results obtained for fragments ( labeled fr1 – fr5 in Fig . 2a ) extracted from the parent molecules . Close inspection of the differential density plots for both singlet and triplet excitations show the same alternating pattern as the one observed for DABNA - 1 , yet with an increasing spreading in space as the fragment becomes larger and / or more conjugated , Fig . 2b . This effect can be quantitatively assessed by computing the CT delocalization volume ( see Supplementary Information " Differ - ence density plots " section for computational details ) . Figure 2c shows strong linear correlations ( R 2 = 0 . 99 ) between both Δ E ST or f osc and the CT volume , with more extended systems providing , remarkably , smaller Δ E ST and larger f osc . The trend is in fact reminiscent of the behavior of localized ( covalent ) excitations in conjugated materials , where the exchange energy measured / calculated in polymer chains is usually signi ﬁ cantly smaller than that in the parent small molecules 17 . Highly emissive molecules with small Δ E ST . The most striking feature arising from Fig . 2c is that while CT delocalization triggers a large decrease in Δ E ST from fr1 ( 0 . 65 eV ) to fr5 ( 0 . 18 eV ) , the lowest excitation f osc strength instead increases along the same sequence , from 0 . 02 in fr1 to 0 . 23 in fr5 . This result contrasts with the behavior observed for conventional D - A - based TADF molecular architectures 12 . Inspired by this ﬁ nding , we applied the multiple charge resonance strategy to design in silico new TADF chromophores based on π - extended B - doped and N - doped nanographenes ( Fig . 3a ) . The results reported in Fig . 3b con - ﬁ rm the trends observed for the fragments in Fig . 2 , i . e . , reduced Δ E ST ( as supported by the Zero Field Splitting calculations , see Supplementary Table 4 ) and enhanced f osc . In the largest com - pound investigated , 6 , the singlet and triplet excitations are found to be quasi - degenerate ( Δ E ST ~ 3 meV ) , yet the singlet f osc is as large as 1 . 0 . Moreover , as all investigated molecules have a rigid backbone with small ( intramolecular ) nuclear reorganization Table 1 Excited state properties Molecule n S 0 - > S n S 0 - > T n Δ E ST ( vert ) Δ E ST ( adiab ) Δ E ST ( exp ) f osc λ reorg DABNA - 1 1 3 . 25 3 . 10 0 . 15 0 . 15 0 . 15 6 0 . 31 0 . 12 2 4 . 23 3 . 75 3 4 . 28 3 . 87 2 1 * 3 . 67 3 . 50 0 . 17 0 . 20 0 . 21 7 0 . 13 0 . 10 2 4 . 15 3 . 74 Vertical excitation energies for the three lowest - lying triplet and singlet excited states , singlet - triplet energy differences ( Δ E ST ) for the vertical and adiabatic transitions , oscillator strengths ( f osc ) , and S 0 - > S 1 reorganization energies ( λ reorg ) obtained for DABNA - 1 and compound 2 with the SCS - CC2 method * S 1 and T 1 are doubly degenerate .

It is important to stress that the increment in f osc is not solely caused by the increase of the number of π - electrons but , instead , occurs primarily through extended delocalization of the wavefunction and increased polarizability along the main - axis of the molecules . Additional insights into this unexpected behavior can be gained from a detailed analysis of the singlet excited - state wavefunctions , in particular of the following two metrics that assess the relative electron - hole quasi - particles : the electron - hole separation ( Δ r ) and the amount of charge transferred ( Δ q ) . Figure 3c points to a picture where the low - lying singlet excited state undergoes substantial reshuf ﬂ ing of the electronic density ( large Δ q values ) but over short distances ( small Δ r values ) . Besides , these characteristics get more pronounced as the ribbons grow longer : Δ r decreases from 0 . 9 to 0 . 6 Å when going from 3 to 6 , while Δ q increases from 0 . 58 | e | in 3 up to 0 . 71 | e | in 6 . The resulting ‘ short - range / local CT ’ states feature both high electron - hole wavefunction overlaps and small exchange interactions , turning into high f osc and low Δ E ST values for the DABNA core building block . In addition , ‘ long - range ’ π - conjugation along ribbons 3 – 6 translates into electronic excitations with extended delocalization and hence increased polarizability and radiative decay rates . While none of these effects is surprising when taken separately , it is the combination of short - range charge separation and long - range electronic delocalization that makes these molecules unique . We believe this is a real breakthrough as most of the low Δ E ST TADF molecules reported so far are characterized by very low f osc and radiative decay rates . This is exempli ﬁ ed by the comparison of compounds 3 – 6 with selected D - A TADF reference molecules , for which f osc and Δ E ST calculated at a similar level of theory ( Fig . 3b and Supplementary Table 2 ) are concurrently small , in line with their Δ r values larger than the 1 . 5 – 2 . 0 Å criterion usually set to discriminate CT excitations 18 that we reported previously 12 . Finally , besides the bene ﬁ cial effect on Δ E ST and f osc , increased delocalization along the series 3 – 6 expectedly produces a spectral red - shift of the lowest singlet excitation , thereby allowing for variations of the emission color from blue to green as a function of the molecular size ( Fig . 3d ) .

For the sake of illustration , we designed two other molecules , 7 and 8 , based on 5 . These chromophores essentially retain the properties of the parent molecule in terms of Δ E ST and f osc ( see Supplementary Table 3 ) , however , they possess emission wavelengths blue - shifted to 2 . 85 eV ( 435 nm , deep blue , 7 ) and red - shifted to 2 . 1 eV ( 590 nm , yellow , 8 ) compared to 5 . To conclude , using highly correlated wavefunction - based methods , we have elucidated the origin for the reduced singlet - triplet gap in the boron - centered azatriangulene molecules originally reported by Hatakeyama et al . as resulting from a local alternating rearrangement of the electronic density upon excitation . We have further shown that this is compatible with high absorption and emission extinction coef ﬁ cients and we have proposed a strategy , based on promoting short - range charge - transfer in π - extended chromophores , as a way to simultaneously optimize RISC and radiative decay rates . This approach has been successfully applied to the design of TADF molecules with : ( i ) close - to - resonant lowest singlet and triplet excited states ; ( ii ) large singlet radiative decay rates ; ( iii ) tunable and expected pure color singlet emission . We hope our theoretical work will catalyze the synthesis and trigger the characterization of a new generation of TADF molecules with unprecedented electroluminescence quantum ef ﬁ ciencies .
