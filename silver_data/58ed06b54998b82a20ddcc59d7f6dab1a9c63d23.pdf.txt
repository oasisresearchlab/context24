The Effect of Helicobacter pylori on Innate Immunity by Michelle Ang A thesis submitted in conformity with the requirements for the degree of Masters of Science Graduate Department of Physiology University of Toronto © Copyright by Michelle Ang ( 2010 ) ii The Effect of Helicobacter pylori on Innate Immunity Michelle Ang Master of Science Department of Physiology University of Toronto 2010 Abstract The innate immune system is important in both acute and chronic infection . In this thesis , I investigated the effect of H . pylori infection on 1 ) DCs , key orchestrators of the immune system , and 2 ) autophagy , recently identified as an important component of innate immunity . I determined that H . pylori activates the STAT3 pathway in DCs , increasing DC maturation and inducing production of IL - 10 , IL - 12p40 and TNF - α , without IL - 12p70 . This cytokine profile may favour an immunoregulatory response , promoting persistent H . pylori infection . In addition I determined that H . pylori ’s VacA toxin induced autophagy , ROS production and Parkin aggregation which has been implicated in mediating autophagy in response to mitochondrial damage . Thus H . pylori alters these key effectors of innate immunity which may play a role in promoting its chronic infection and disease . iii Acknowledgments The many people who have helped me through the graduate process are so numerous that to name them all would double this thesis’s length .

H . pylori is acquired early in life and persists for the lifetime of the host . Infection is associated with the development of chronic gastritis and peptic ulcers ( Cover and Blaser , 2009 ) . In addition , H . pylori is classified as a type 1 carcinogen and is the single most important risk factor in the development of gastric cancer , the second most common cancer worldwide ( Amieva and El Omar , 2008 ; Correa and Houghton , 2007 ) . The bacterium is highly adapted to colonize in the human stomach where various factors including gastric acidity , nutrient availability , innate and adaptive immunity limit most other bacterial colonization ( Cover and Blaser , 2009 ) . H . pylori achieves gastric colonization through a number of factors such as utilizing flagella which act as propellers to travel through the viscous mucosa , and through the enzyme urease , which converts urea into NH 3 and CO 2 , thereby increasing the pH to buffer the environment surrounding the bacteria ( Dhar et al . , 2003 ; Montecucco and Rappuoli , 2001 ; Portal - Celhay and Perez - Perez , 2006 ) . H . pylori also utilizes specialized adherence mechanisms ensuring a persistent and chronic infection . Utilizing the outer - membrane protein BabA , H . pylori strongly adheres to the Lewis B blood group antigens expressed on gastric epithelial cells and within the gastric mucus ( Linden et al . , 2002 ; Montecucco and Rappuoli , 2001 ) . Another bacterial adhesion SabA also mediates interaction with Lewis X receptors , maintaining a weaker interaction that is upregulated during inflammation ( Linden et al . , 2002 ) . Using these factors , H . pylori adheres to gastric epithelial cells allowing the bacterium to maintain close proximity to the epithelial cell layer , allowing for the translocation of bacterial effector proteins and access to cellular nutrients thereby forming an environmentally favourable niche for bacterial survival . 2 1 . 2 H . pylori Associated Diseases Infection with H . pylori is associated with the development of several disease phenotypes . All individuals infected with H . pylori develop chronic gastritis , an inflammatory response that is insufficient to eradicate the organism from the host . Additionally , approximately 10 - 20 % of infected individuals will go on to develop peptic ulcers , associated with antral predominant gastritis and increased acid secretion ( Kusters et al . , 2006 ) . H . pylori infection is also the strongest risk factor for the development of gastric cancers including lymphoma , MALT lymphoma and adenocarcinoma . Gastric cancer occurs in 1 - 2 % of the infected population ( Cover and Blaser , 2009 ; Lochhead and El Omar , 2007 ) . Correa proposed a model of H . pylori - mediated gastric carcinogenesis in which there is a sequential array of pathological changes that convert normal gastric mucosa to a cancerous environment beginning with the development of chronic active gastritis , followed by atrophy of the gastric tissue and inflammatory damage . This causes progression to intestinal metaplasia , dysplasia and eventually the development of gastric cancer ( Correa , 2003 ; Correa , 2004 ; Correa and Houghton , 2007 ) . However , the exact mechanisms leading to the development of gastric cancer remain unclear . Bacterial , host and environmental factors ( Table 1 ) are thought to contribute to an increased risk for the development of gastric cancer . Investigating the role of bacterial factors in altering host immune responses is the focus of my research . 1 . 3 H . pylori Virulence Factors 1 . 3 . 1 Cytotoxin Associated Gene A ( CagA ) The most well characterized virulence factor is the cytotoxin - associated gene A ( CagA ) found within the ( cag ) pathogenicity island ( PAI ) . The cag PAI encodes a type IV secretion system ( TFSS ) similar to those found in Agrobacterium tumefaciens , Bordetella pertussis and Legionella pneumophila . The TFSS acts as a molecular syringe to inject CagA proteins into host cells ( Bourzac and Guillemin , 2005 ; Odenbreit et al . , 2000 ) . Infection with strains of H . pylori containing CagA confers a higher risk for the development of gastric cancer ( Parsonnet et al . , 1997 ) . Furthermore transgenic mice expressing the CagA virulence factor develop gastrointestinal and hematopoietic neoplasms , confirming that CagA is tumourigenic ( Ohnishi et al . , 2008 ) . The exact mechanisms by which CagA promotes cancer remain unknown . Once 3 Table 1 : Host , genetic bacterial and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of H . pylori induced gastric cancer .

This phosphorylation occurs within a repeated specific 5 amino acid motif ( EPIYA – Glu - Pro - Ile - Tyr - Ala ) on the tyrosine residue ( Parsonnet et al . , 1997 ) . The presence and number or EPIYA repeats may contribute to severity of disease outcome ( Dhar et al . , 2003 ) . Upon phosphorylation , CagA binds to SRC Homology 2 ( SH2 ) domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 , deregulating this oncoprotein , activating phosphatase activity and forming a complex that initiates mitogenic signalling , cell scattering , elongation and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton ( Kusters et al . , 2006 ) . CagA also has actions independent of its EPIYA tyrosine phosphorylation . For example , unphosphorylated CagA can target the c - Met receptor as well as bind to Grb2 ( Churin et al . , 2003 ; Mimuro et al . , 2002 ) . CagA also interacts in a phosphorylation independent manner with ZO - 1 and junctional adhesion molecule ( JAM ) thereby altering tight junctions ( Amieva et al . , 2003 ; Hatakeyama , 2006 ) . 1 . 3 . 2 Vacuolating Cytotoxin A ( VacA ) Another important bacterial virulence factor is the vacuolating cytotoxin A ( VacA ) so named for its ability to induce vacuoles in cells . VacA is a toxin secreted by H . pylori . VacA released from H . pylori is cleaved into two fragments , a 33 kDa N - terminal fragment ( p33 ) and a 55 kDa c - terminal fragment which exist as a large ogliomeric complex when purified ( Dhar et al . , 2003 ) . Exposure to acidic and alkaline conditions causes these oligomeric components to disassociate into the monomeric subunits ( Cover and Blanke , 2005 ) . The p55 fragment has an important role in the binding of VacA to host cells ( Cover and Blanke , 2005 ; Galmiche et al . , 2000 ) . Once bound to the cell , VacA is internalized by a pinocytic mechanism into GPI - AP - enriched early endosomal compartments ( GEECs ) ( Gauthier et al . , 2007 ) . Upon VacA’s internalization into GEECs , it forms anion - selective channels by assembling into hexameric , ring like structures , allowing chloride ions to pass through , resulting in swelling in endosomal membranes and vacuole formation ( Figure 1 - 2 ) . These channels release bicarbonate and organic anions from the cell cytosol to support bacterial growth ( Cover and Blanke , 2005 ; Dhar et al . , 2003 ; Szabo et al . , 1999 ) . These large , intracellular vacuoles , with acidic intralumenal environments are enriched in markers for late ( but not early ) endosomal compartments , such as Rab7 , LAMP1 and Lgp110 ( Papini et al . , 1994 ) . 5 6 Figure 1 - 1 : H . pyori CagA signalling pathway . CagA is injected into host cells upon H . pylori infection via the bacterial TFSS . Once injected , CagA is localized near the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane until it is recruited by SRC kineases . SRC kineases phosphorylate CagA on EPIYA motifs . Phosphorylated CagA then binds SHP - 2 , activating SHP - 2’s phosphatase activity and forming a complex that initiates mitogenic signalling , cell scattering , elongation and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton . Phosphorylation independent CagA interacts with c - Met and Grb2 , as well as interacting with ZO - 1 and JAM to alter tight junctions . Stomach Lumen Oligomerization and Membrane interaction Endocytic entry into cell H + ( V - ATPase ) H2O NH3 NH4 + Cl - channel activity Vacuole swelling 7 8 Figure 1 - 2 : VacA induces cellular vacuolation . Upon VacA release by H . pylori , VacA binds to the cell surface , where it oligomerizes and is internalized via the GEEC pathway . Internalized VacA forms anion - selective channels which allow chloride conductance , causing increased intraluminal chloride concentration . As a result , increased ATPase activity occurs , increasing proton pumping which reduces intraluminal pH . Membrane - permeant weak bases diffuse inwards and are trapped within these compartments . Compartments undergo osmotic swelling , resulting in cellular vacuolation . Modified from Cover and Blanke ( 2005 ) 9 The p33 fragment of VacA localizes specifically to the mitochondria where it affects mitochondrial membrane permeability ( Figure 1 - 3 ) . VacA decreases the levels of 3 , 3 ' - dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide , an indicator of mitochondrial membrane potential , followed by a decrease in cellular ATP indicating mitochondrial and cellular damage ( Kimura et al . , 1999 ) . The decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential coincides with decreased ATP levels and O 2 consumption which suggests that VacA damages the mitochondrial inner membrane ( Kimura et al . , 1999 ) . These mitochondrial effects are dependent on VacA’s ability to form anion - selective channels described previously ( Willhite and Blanke , 2004b ) . VacA also modulates the function of several immune cells which will be discussed below . In T - cells , VacA can inhibit T - cell proliferation and viability , by downregulating the IL - 2 α - receptor and inhibiting production of stimulatory IL - 2 ( Gebert et al . , 2003 ; Sundrud et al . , 2004 ) . VacA activates the MAP kinase pathway ( Boncristiano et al . , 2003 ; Sundrud et al . , 2004 ) and the NF - κB pathway in T - cells to promote proinflammatory effects through the induction of genes involved in the classical NF - κB pathway ( Takeshima et al . , 2009 ) . VacA inhibits the activation of Jurkat T cells ( a human T cell lymphoma / leukemia cell line ) by inhibiting the activation of NFAT , a key transcription factor required for the expression of genes involved in T cell activation ( Boncristiano et al . , 2003 ; Gebert et al . , 2003 ) . Finally , it has been demonstrated that VacA can suppress the proliferation of primary human CD8 + T cells and CD4 + T - cells even when strongly stimulated by potent T - cell activators ( Torres et al . , 2007 ) . VacA also acts on APCs , interfering with major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class II mediated antigen presentation inhibiting the li - dependent pathway of antigen presentation . In addition , VacA blocks antigen presentation on APCs to T - cells ( Boncristiano et al . , 2003 ; Molinari et al . , 1998 ) . B - cells have also been shown to be affected by the VacA toxin . VacA induces the apoptosis of B - cells via the translocation of the apoptosis - inducing factor to the nucleus ( Singh et al . , 2006 ) . Similar to T - cells , VacA inhibits the activation and proliferation of B - cells , even when stimulated by potent B - cell activators ( Torres et al . , 2007 ) . 10 In macrophages , phagosome maturation is arrested by VacA , preventing the killing of H . pylori by phagocytes ( Zheng and Jones , 2003 ) . In clinical isolates , there were lower observed levels of bacterial multiplication in macrophages in strains that lacked the VacA gene ( Wang et al . , 2009 ) . There is some evidence to indicate that VacA has some pro - inflammatory effects , as increasing levels of TNF - α and IL - 6 due to VacA in mast cells was observed , however these effects need further study ( Cover and Blanke , 2005 ) .

VacA toxin has many different effects within the cell . VacA can localize to the mitochondria , causing a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential , causing release of cytochrome c . VacA can also be internalized and cause pro - inflammatory signalling , as well as interfere with the activation and proliferation of T - cells . In addition , VacA induces formation of large intracellular vacuoles as described previously . Modified from Cover and Blanke ( 2005 ) . 13 1 . 3 . 3 Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) Lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) is an important structural component of the outer membrane of gram - negative bacteria containing three parts : lipid A , a core oligosaccharide and an O side chain ( Lu et al . , 2008 ) . LPS contains pathogen - associated molecular patterns ( PAMPs ) which are recognized by host cells to initiate innate responses . Lipid A is the main PAMP in LPS . Normally , LPS stimulation of mammalian cells occurs through a series of interacting proteins such as LPS binding protein ( LBP ) , which facilitates interaction of LPS to CD14 , a glycosylphosphatidylinositol - anchored protein ( Lu et al . , 2008 ) . CD14 interacts with Toll - like receptor ( TLR ) 4 , which upon LPS recognition , undergoes oligomerization , recruiting downstream adaptors , initiating activation of the NF - κB signalling pathway , increasing proinflammatory cytokine production through a myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 ( MyD88 ) dependant or independent pathway ( Lu et al . , 2008 ) . LPS from H . pylori possesses some unusual characteristics that differ from other gram - negative bacteria’s LPS as it appears to be less potent at driving a pro - inflammatory response . H . pylori LPS fails to induce inflammatory responses in epithelial cells at high concentrations ( Backhed et al . , 2003 ) . It is also known to be 1000 times less effective than E . coli LPS in inducing pro - inflammatory cytokine production in macrophages / monocytes , as well as being less effective than E . coli endotoxin in binding to LBP ( Cunningham et al . , 1996 ; Gobert et al . , 2004 ) . H . pylori LPS signalling may also differ from the conventional pathway . It has also been reported that TLR - 2 not TLR - 4 is the major TLR activated by LPS during H . pylori infection giving H . pylori LPS a different signalling pathway from normal LPS which may attribute to its differing characteristics ( Smith , Jr . et al . , 2003 ; Uno et al . , 2007 ) . Other studies suggest that H . pylori strains act as antagonists for human TLR - 4 ( Lepper et al . , 2005 ) . 2 Innate Immunity As H . pylori causes a chronic infection , the ability of the bacterium to evade host immune responses including potentially escaping tumour immune surveillance is an area of great interest and the focus of my thesis . The host immune system consists of both innate and adaptive immunity . Innate immunity is a fast acting response , reacting quickly in bacterial infection with the aim of eliminating the bacteria . The adaptive immune response is generally more delayed and 14 its responses are shaped by the innate immune response . An additional component of the host immune response , which has recently been recognized , is the autophagy pathway . Below I will summarize current knowledge with respect to the key areas of focus of my research in H . pylori and innate immunity : dendritic cells and autophagy . 2 . 1 Dendritic Cells ( DCs ) Dendritic cells ( DCs ) are a type of antigen presenting cell ( APC ) whose primary role is to uptake , process and present antigens to T - cells , initiating and activating cytokine release and immune responses ( Lenahan and Avigan , 2006 ; Zou , 2005 ) . Immature DCs are adept at antigen capture , and circulate throughout the body until they encounter antigens . Following antigen uptake , they process and convert proteins to peptides and present these processed peptides to T - cells on MHC molecules ( Steinman and Banchereau , 2007 ) ( Figure 1 - 4 ) . During this antigen processing phase , these DCs mature and differentiate , increasing surface expression of MHC class II , CD80 and CD86 , which are costimulatory molecules necessary for T cell activation ( Lenahan and Avigan , 2006 ) . Activated T - cells can have many responses whose direction is dictated by APCs . Under the control of DCs , T - cells can acquire the capacity to produce powerful cytokines to initiate a Th1 proinflammatory response , a Th2 antibody forming response , a Th17 autoimmune response and even a T - regulatory ( Treg ) immunotolerance response ( Ferrero , 2005 ) . To stimulate T - cells , peptides must be processed by MHC molecules which will present the peptide on the surface of the DC . The peptide - binding proteins are of two types , MHC class I and MHC class II . MHC class I molecules assist in the processing of intracellular antigens and will present them to cytotoxic T - cells which , once activated , can directly kill a target ( Banchereau and Steinman , 1998 ) . MHC class II complexes recognize and process extracellular antigens and present them to T - helper cells which can have profound immune - regulatory effects . A normal inflammatory response initially consists of the recruitment of neutrophils , followed by T cells , plasma cells , and APCs which is accompanied by epithelial cell damage ( Goodwin et al . , 1986 ) . The failure of the recruitment and maturation of DCs has been observed at tumour sites , indicating that a dysfunctional DC response may lead to carcinogenesis ( Lenahan and Avigan , 2006 ) . Additionally it has been observed that there is an increase in the number of immature DCs in patients with cancer , indicating that maturation is an important factor in DC function ( Lenahan 15 and Avigan , 2006 ) . In many cancer types the signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) pathway is upregulated , which has been shown to inhibit DC maturation for oncogenic survival and proliferation ( Lunz , III et al . , 2007 ; Wang et al . , 2004 ) . 16 17 Figure 1 - 4 : Model of DC activation . Immature DCs circulating in the lamina propria come into contact with antigens released by extracellular factors or the epithelial cell layer . Immature DCs sample these antigens and increase their surface expression in many DC maturation markers such as CD86 , CD80 and MHC class II . Immature DCs are now mature DCs and APCs , where they present the processed antigen to other immune cells such as T - cells to orchestrate the appropriate immune response . Activation of the STAT3 pathway can inhibit the maturation process . 18 2 . 2 Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) 2 . 2 . 1 STAT3 Signalling Cascade STAT3 is a transcription factor whose upregulation is thought to be involved in oncogenesis . The STAT3 pathway can be activated by a number of different cytokines ( such as IL - 6 ) , growth factors and peptides , all signalling through gp130 , a signal transducer receptor subunit that can be activated by several members of the IL - 6 family of cytokines ( Hirano et al . , 1997 ; Kim et al . , 2007a ) ( Figure 1 - 5 ) . IL - 6 activation of STAT3 occurs through the binding of the cytokine to its receptor IL - 6R , resulting in heterodimerization with the gp130 subunit ( Kim et al . , 2007a ) . This heterodimer activates the receptor associated Janus Kinase ( JAK ) kinases which in turn phosphorylate tyrosine residues on the cytoplasmic tail of the gp130 receptor , recruiting STAT3 to the phosphorylated residues ( Greenlund et al . , 1995 ) . STAT3 monomers will then be phosphorylated themselves on tyrosine 705 residues , and then dimerize through reciprocal Src - homology - 2 ( SH2 ) domain phospho - tyrosine interactions . STAT3 dimers will be translocated into the nucleus , using nuclear localization signals mediated by the importinα3 / α6 complex , which when interacting with importinβ allows the dimer to traffic through nuclear pore complexes that span the nuclear membranes ( Reich and Liu , 2006 ; Yang and Stark , 2008 ) . Here , central DNA binding domains located on the STAT3 monomers allow the dimer to bind directly to response elements in the promoter regions of target genes to trigger induction of transcription of several genes involved in growth and proliferation ( Liu et al . , 2005 ; Reich and Liu , 2006 ) . The STAT family of transcriptional regulators include an IFNα - stimulated gene response element ( ISRE ) and the Gamma - IFN – stimulated activation sequence ( GAS : TTTCCNGGAAA ) ( Horvath and Darnell , 1997 ) . This interaction induces the transcription of multiple genes involved in apoptosis ( surviving , Bcl - nL , HSP27 ) , cell cycle regulation ( cyclin D1 , c - myc , c - fos ) , angiogenesis ( vascular endothelial growth factor ) , cell invasion , metastasis and immune function ( Kim et al . , 2007a ; Kisseleva et al . , 2002 ; Levy and Darnell , Jr . , 2002 ) . STAT3 dimers can also be phosphorylated on the serine 727 residue . Phosphorylation of this residue results in dimers with increased transcriptional activity for recognition sites involved in the mitogen - activated protein ( MAP ) kinase pathway ( Horvath and Darnell , 1997 ) . 19 20 Figure 1 - 5 : The STAT3 activation pathway . IL - 6 molecules bind to the IL - 6 - αR . This leads to heterodimerization with the gp130 subunit . This dimer activates associated JAK kinases which phosphorylate residues on the cytoplasmic tail of the gp130 receptor . Cytoplasmic STAT3 monomers are recruited to these phosphorylated sites and form dimers via their reciprocal SH2 phospho - tyrosine interactions . Dimeric STAT3 translocates to the nucleus via importins - α3 and α6 through nuclear pore complexes and leads to the transcription of genes involved in survival , proliferation and angiogenesis , potentially leading to carcinogenesis . 21 2 . 2 . 2 STAT3 , DCs and Cancer Evidence suggests that STAT3 is involved in carcinogenesis , as this pathway is constitutively activated in 50 - 90 % of human cancers ( Kortylewski and Yu , 2007 ) . Disrupting constitutive STAT3 activation in tumours results in the induction of apoptosis by increasing proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression , indicating that STAT3 activation may play a role in the reduction of proinflammatory responses , and thus increase immune evasion ( Wang et al . , 2004 ) . Inhibition of STAT3 results in a production of inflammatory mediators that can activate DCs ( Wang et al . , 2004 ) . Additionally , disruption of STAT3 activates innate immune cells in vivo , and also effects adaptive immunity from DCs as when STAT3 is activated , DCs do not undergo maturation ( Wang et al . , 2004 ) . Similarly , blocking STAT3 in tumours leads to the activation of T cells , promoting DC maturation , demonstrating the ability of STAT3 to inhibit DC mediated immune responses ( Wang et al . , 2004 ) . 2 . 2 . 3 STAT3 and H . pylori We have shown that H . pylori activates the STAT3 pathway in gastric epithelial cells in vitro and in vivo in a CagA dependant mechanism , thereby favoring the development of gastric cancer ( Bronte - Tinkew et al . , 2009 ) . In the Mongolian gerbil , STAT3 activation was detected in gastric epithelial cells upon infection with CagA + H . pylori ( Bronte - Tinkew et al . , 2009 ) . In addition , STAT3 activation was detected in infiltrating immune cells during infection of Mongolian gerbils ( Figure 1 - 6 ) suggesting that activation of this pathway may alter host immune responses . 2 . 3 Dendritic Cells and H . pylori As DCs are key modulators of immune responses , the ability of H . pylori to alter DC function is of great interest . How H . pylori alters DC function is controversial . DCs are capable of entering H . pylori infected gastric epithelium , where they uptake bacteria directly through the extension of long luminal projections by DCs through epithelial apical - junctions ( Necchi et al . , 2009 ; Wilson and Crabtree , 2007 ) ( Figure 1 - 7 ) . H . pylori induces the secretion of many different cytokines such as IL - 6 , IL - 8 , IL - 10 , IL - 12 , IL - 1 , and tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) ( Kranzer et al . , 2005 ; Rad et al . , 2007 ) . Control H . pylori infected 22 23 Figure 1 - 6 : From Bronte - Tinkew et al . Nuclear STAT3 detected in epithelial and inflammatory cells of H . pylori CagA + infected Mongolian gerbil tissue . A ) Mongolian gerbil stomach sections were stained via immunohistochemistry with STAT3 ( red ) and DAPI ( blue ) antibodies .

Dashed lines represent the components of the pathway that are more speculative . H . pylori has several effects on the immune response , effecting the release of several cytokines that alter Th1 , Th2 and Treg responses . Modified from Wilson and Crabtree ( 2007 ) . 26 The effects of this cytokine secretion are unclear . Some studies demonstrate that H . pylori can induce DC maturation , upregulating DC surface expression of CD80 , CD83 and CD86 ( Kranzer et al . , 2004 ; Rad et al . , 2007 ) . Conversely , other studies show that H . pylori inhibits DC activation via modulation of IL - 12 secretion , potentially leading to immune evasion ( Kao et al . , 2006 ; Obonyo et al . , 2006 ) . In our studies with the Mongolian gerbil , activation of STAT3 was detected in infiltrating immune cells . Therefore , I hypothesized that H . pylori infection would activate STAT3 in dendritic cells , thereby altering host immune responses . Determining the effect of H . pylori infection on STAT3 activation in dendritic cells is the focus of chapter three of my thesis . 2 . 4 Autophagy Another important host response which modulates immunity and infection is autophagy . Autophagy is a process that involves the sequestering and transit of cytoplasmic components or organelles to the lysosome for degradation . These broken down substrates are then used to produce amino acids for protein and energy synthesis ( Meijer and Codogno , 2006 ) . There are three types of autophagy : Microautophagy , macroautophagy and chaperone - mediated autophagy . Microautophagy is responsible for engulfing large structures , sequestering cytosolic components directly by lysosomes through invaginations in their membranes ( Klionsky and Emr , 2000 ) . Chaperone - mediated autophagy can only degrade soluble proteins , and involves direct translocation of unfolded substrate proteins across the lysosome membrane ( Klionsky and Emr , 2000 ) . Macroautophagy ( henceforth referred to as autophagy ) , sequesters and engulf large structures within a unique double - membraned vesicle in selective and non - selective processes ( Klionsky and Emr , 2000 ) . Subsequently , these cargo are delivered to the lysosome where the cargo is degraded or recycled ( Levine and Klionsky , 2004 ) . Upon induction of autophagy , the process begins with the formation of double - membrane compartments called autophagosomes . The origin of these membrane compartments is unclear . It is thought that membrane compartments may originate from the ER , however evidence also demonstrates that the pre - autophagosomal structure ( PAS ) contains Atg9 , and in addition to localizing with the PAS , membrane components can also be visualized with Mitoflour , a dye used to identify mitochondrial membrane components , suggesting that the mitochondria may provide components for the autophagosome ( Klionsky and Emr , 2000 ; Reggiori et al . , 2005 ) . 27 The formation of the PAS and autophagosome involves several Atg genes , with Atg9 being the only transmembrane protein in the core machinery that is conserved among species ( Xie and Klionsky , 2007 ) ( Figure 1 - 8 ) . Two ubiquitin - like conjugation reactions are needed to form the Atg12 - Atg5 complex . The carboxy COOH terminal of Atg12 is activated by linking first to Atg7 , an E1 - like enzyme , which passes the Atg12 to Atg10 , an E2 - like enzyme , which is then attached to the internal lysine residue 130 of Atg5 , later recruiting Atg16 to form an Atg12 - Atg5 - Atg16 multimer complex ( Klionsky and Emr , 2000 ) . This complex is present on the PAS , however dissipates upon autophagosome formation . Autophagosomal elongation is mediated by mictotubule - associated light chain ( LC ) - 3 ( Atg8 in yeast ) . The second reaction of LC3 lipidation which joins LC3 to phosphatidylethanolamine ( PE ) first involves Atg4 which cleaves LC3’s carboxy terminal leaving a conserved glycine residue ( Klionsky and Emr , 2000 ) . Cleaved LC3 next binds to Atg7 , then Atg3 and finally to autophagosomal membrane protein PE , where it becomes membrane - bound LC3 - II ( Klionsky and Emr , 2000 ) . This complex is present in the initial stage of autophagosome formation , and remains on the autophagosome throughout formation and fusion with the lysosome and is often used as a marker of autophagy in experimentation ( Yorimitsu and Klionsky , 2005 ) . Complete autophagosomes are then delivered to lysosomes in a manner dependant on microtubules and maintenance of proper acidification ( Klionsky and Emr , 2000 ) . Intermediate autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes and acquire cathepsins and acid phosphatases to become mature autolysosomes , where the inner autophagosomal membrane is degraded . Autophagy plays an important role in immunity , as autophagic machinery is often used in defence against microbes , delivering microorganisms to lysosomes for degradation ( a process called xenophagy ) and the delivery of microbial nucleic acids and antigens to endosomal / lysosomal compartments to activate innate or adaptive immunity ( Levine and Kroemer , 2008 ) . Several bacteria are degraded by xenophagy , including Mycobacterium tubercuolosis , Shigella flexneri , Salmonella enterica , and Listeria monocytogenes ( Huang and Klionsky , 2007 ; Levine and Kroemer , 2008 ) . Atg5 has been shown to be crucial in the delivery of viral nucleic acids from the Sendat virus to endosomal TLR - 7 receptors which then activate DCs ( Lee et al . , 2007 ) . Autophagy is also involved in the delivery of synthesized microbial antigens to MHC class II APCs which subsequently activate CD4 + T cells ( Paludan et al . , 2005 ) . Formation of Sequestration Cresent Lysosome Lysosomal Hydrolases Docking & Fusion Atg5 - Atg12 - Atg16 complex LC3 II 28 29 Figure 1 - 8 : Overview of the autophagic process in mammalian cells . Cytosolic components and organelles are either specifically or randomly targeted by the PAS . A sequesteration crescent forms around these components initially requiring the Atg5 - Atg12 - Atg16 complex ( red dots ) , followed by LC3 lipidation into the LC3II form ( yellow dots ) . The Atg5 - Atg12 - Atg16 complex disassociates prior to autophagosome completion , while LC3II remains on the autophagosome throughout . Lysosomes are trafficked to completed autophagosomes , where they fuse . The inner membrane of the autophagosome is degraded , followed by degradation of autophagosomal contents by lysosomal hydrolases . 30 Autophagy also has been shown to have a role in tumourigenesis as failure to clear the intracellular debris normally eliminated by autophagy can lead to tissue damage , cell death and chronic inflammation that is tumour promoting ( White et al . , 2010 ) . Atg6 / beclin1 is a haploinsufficient tumour suppressor in mice ( Qu et al . , 2003 ; Yue et al . , 2003 ) . Atg6 / beclin1 has been shown to be monoalleically deleted in ovarian and breast cancer ( Qu et al . , 2003 ) . Inactivating mutations in Atg5 were found to be infrequently present in colorectal cancer ( Jung et al . , 2008 ) . Losses of other autophagy mediators such as p63 and Atg4c were also shown to enhance tumour formation ( Marino et al . , 2007 ; Mathew et al . , 2009 ) . Basal levels of autophagy are responsible for the clearance of damaged organelles , such as the mitochondria . The importance of mitochondrial degradation is expected , given the fact that mitochondrial homeostasis in a cell is crucial . Specific autophagy targeting the mitochondria ( mitophagy ) has been a growing field of interest , as mitochondrial instability , such as changes in Mitochondrial Permeability Transition ( MPT ) can play a role in the initiation of mitophagy . Mitochondrial production of ROS is an important factor for the overall ROS level within a cell . Mitochondria ROS production produces superoxide and H 2 O 2 through its respiratory chain , and accumulation of these ROS can lead to lipid peroxidation , apoptosis and necrosis , mitochondrial dysfunction and DNA damage ( Murphy , 2009 ) . Additionally , the ROS produced by the mitochondria have been reported to regulate autophagy and autophagic cell death , as autophagy is induced by rotenone , H 2 O 2 , and superoxide ( Chen and Gibson , 2008 ) . ROS production can also lead to 10 - 20 fold higher mutation rates in mitochondrial DNA versus nuclear DNA ( Yakes and Van Houten , 1997 ) which may also induce mitophagy . Failure to clear the cell of damaged mitochondria can lead to cellular damage , thus leading to cell death ( Kim et al . , 2007b ) . Oxidative damage due to ROS production plays an important role in tumourigenesis as increased ROS levels are often associated with cancerous cells . Increased ROS levels can lead to DNA damage , implicated in mutating tumour suppressor p53 ( Morgan et al . , 2003 ) causing carcinogenesis . Additionally , ROS production is involved in Ras - Raf - MEK signalling . This pathway is important in mediating protection against apoptotic cell death induced by increased oxidative stress , directly enhancing the activation of Ras , and augmenting ERK1 / 2 , leading to oncogenesis ( Pan et al . , 2009 ) . Lipid peroxidation leading to ROS production has also been shown to cause DNA damage due to the production of high levels of oxygen radicals ( Marnett , 31 2000 ) . Thus there is a well - established link between ROS generation and tumourigenesis which may prove to play a role in H . pylori mediated tumourigenesis . 2 . 4 . 1 H . pylori and Autophagy Recently , our lab has shown that H . pylori can induce autophagy in human gastric epithelial ( AGS ) cells , and that its VacA toxin is sufficient to induce this autophagy ( Terebiznik et al . , 2009 ) . Induction of autophagy was dependant on VacA’s channel - forming ability , and limited the effects of VacA ( Terebiznik et al . , 2009 ) . However , the exact mechanisms by which VacA induces autophagy remain unknown . I hypothesized that VacA mediated damage to mitochondria may be sufficient to induce autophagy . Determining the mechanisms responsible for VacA mediated autophagy is the focus of chapter four of my thesis . 3 Summary In summary H . pylori evades host responses to cause a chronic infection and promote carcinogenesis in a subpopulation of those infected . Despite intense research in the field , the mechanisms by which H . pylori evades the host immune response are still unclear . In my thesis , I will explore two distinct avenues by which H . pylori may alter or hide from the innate immune response . Firstly , I will explore the interaction of H . pylori on a key orchestrator of the immune response : the dendritic cell . Through interactions with this key APC , H . pylori may significantly alter the outcome of the innate immune response . Secondly , I will explore the role of H . pylori mediated autophagy to try and determine the mechanisms responsible for the induction of this response . Changes in the autophagic pathway may modify the host cell immune response , providing another mechanism by with H . pylori alters the innate immune response . Overall hypothesis The overall hypothesis of my thesis is that H . pylori effects host innate immune responses to promote chronic infection and disease . Specific aims The specific aims of my thesis are : 32 1 . To determine whether H . pylori activates the STAT3 pathway in DCs thus altering the host immune response and providing a mechanism for H . pylori ’s immune evasion 2 . To determine the mechanisms by which H . pylori ’s VacA toxin induces autophagy 33 Chapter 2 Materials and Methods CHAPTER 3 MATERIALS AND METHODS Bone Marrow Derived DCs Bone marrow - derived DCs ( BMDCs ) were obtained and cultured from wild - type ( WT ) C57BL / 6 mice .

Cells were incubated at 37°C for 3 days before an additional 10ml of RPMI mixture was added . On day 6 , cells were harvested and magnetically sorted for the CD11c + surface marker ( Miltenyi Biotec , Bergisch Gladbach , Germany ) to ensure a pure DC population . Sorted cells were then plated in 6 - well tissue culture plates and used for stimulation . H . pylori Strains and Infection Conditions H . pylori gerbil adapted strain 7 . 13 or the corresponding isogenic cagA - mutant were grown on blood agar plates containing 5 % sheep blood under microaerophilic conditions ( 5 % O 2 , 10 % CO 2 , 85 % N 2 ) . Isogenic mutant strains were grown on Columbia blood agar plates supplemented with 10 % FBS and 20μg / ml kanamycin under similar conditions . After a monolayer of bacteria were grown on the plates , bacteria were then transferred and grown in Brucella broth with 10 % FBS for 18 h , harvested by centrifugation , and added to gastric cells at a multiplicities of infection ( MOI ) of 25 : 1 . In some experiments , H . pylori was heat killed by boiling for 20 min in sealed sterile Eppendorf tubes . Heat killing was confirmed by lack of growth on Columbia blood agar plates . Where indicated , 30 min before infection , cells were incubated with the STAT3 inhibitor S3I - 201at 25μM ( Calbiochem , La Jolla , CA , USA ) . For controls , cells were incubated with IL - 6 ( 50ng / ml ; Cell Signalling , Danvers , MA , USA ) for 30 min , or 24 hours ; or E . coli LPS ( 1μg / ml ; Sigma Aldrich ) for 24h . 34 Cell Lysates and Western Blotting After 4h or 24h of infection , cells were washed and scraped in 75μl of RIPA buffer containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors ( all from Sigma Aldrich ) . Cell suspensions were centrifuged and supernatants stored at - 80°C . Protein concentrations were measured using the Biorad D c protein assay . Lysates in laemelli buffer were loaded onto 10 % SDS - polyacrylamide separating gels and run at 110V for 1 . 5h at room temperature . Proteins were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane ( BioTrace NT ; Pall Corp . , All Arbor , MI , USA ) at 100V for 1 . 5 hours at 4°C . Membranes were blocked with Tris - buffered saline with tween ( TBST ) , 5 % skim milk followed by incubation with either rabbit anti - phospho - STAT3 antibody ( 1 : 250 ; Cell Signalling MA , USA ) or mouse anti - STAT3 antibody ( 1 : 500 , Cell Signalling ) in TBST milk . Blots were then incubated with corresponding secondary horseradish peroxidase - conjugated antibody ( Jackson Laboratories , PA , USA ) for 1h at room temperature . Bands were visualized by chemiluminescence using Kodak Biomax MR film . Densitometric analysis Densitometric analysis was performed using FlourChem FCII software . All blots from each independent experiment were used . Densities of phosphorylated STAT3 ( PSTAT3 ) and STAT3 bands were measured for each treatment and expressed as a ratio ( PSTAT3 / STAT3 ) . Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting ( FACS ) – Flow Cytometry BMDCs infected for 24h were utilized for flow - cytometric analysis . Cells were scraped gently on ice in PBS and spun at 350g for 10 min . Cells were resuspended in FACS buffer ( PBS containing 0 . 05 % of sodium azide ) . Cells were incubated with CD16 / 32 ( Fc receptor block ) ( 1μl / 10 6 cells ; eBioscience , San Diego CA , USA ) for 15 minutes at 4°C prior to staining to block nonspecific staining . Subsequently , cells were washed with FACS buffer and incubated with the following antibodies : Flourescein isothiocyanate ( FITC ) - labeled antibody to CD11c , phycoerythrin ( PE ) - labeled antibodies to CD86 and CD80 , peridinin chlorophyll protein - cyanine ( PerCP - Cy5 . 5 ) - conjugated antibody to CD11b ( all from eBioscience ) , biotin - labeled antibodies specific for MHC class II followed by streptavidin conjugated to allophycocyanin ( APC ) ( Becton Dickson , San Jose , CA , USA ) . After staining , cells were washed twice with FACS buffer and 35 analyzed by FACS ( FACSCaliburflow cytometer ; Becton Dickinson ) . FlowJo software was used for the analysis of the results . ELISA Cytokine Analysis BMDCs were infected for 24h as described above . Supernatants were collected and flash frozen and stored at - 80°C . Supernatants were assayed for IL - 6 , IL - 10 , IL - 12p40 and TNF - α using specific ELISAs as per the manufacturer’s instructions ( R & D systems , MN , USA ) . Multiplex Bead - based Luminex Assay Supernatants from BMDCs were assayed for IL - 2 , IL - 4 , IL - 5 , IL - 10 , IL - 12 , IL - 17 and IFN - γ using the Th1 / Th2 Cytokine Mouse 6 - Plex Panel kit plus the IL - 17 Mouse Singleplex Bead Luminex Assay Kit as per the manufacturer’s instructions ( Invitrogen ) . MTT live / dead cell Assay To determine whether cell viability was affected by the addition of S3I - 201 or other agents , an in vitro toxicology MTT assay ( Sigma Aldrich ) was performed . BMDCs were grown and infected for 24h as described . Viable cells contain mitochondrial dehydrogenase , which cleaves the tetrazolium substrate ring , yielding purple formazan crystals . The degree of mitochondrial enzymatic activity was determined via the dissolution of formazan precipitate and spectrophotometric analysis of the resulting solutions from each treatment . CHAPTER 4 MATERIALS AND METHODS Cell and Bacterial Culture Human gastric epithelial cells ( AGS ) were grown in Ham’s F - 12 media ( Wisent St . Bruno , PQ , Canada ) supplemented with 10 % FBS and incubated at 37°C in a CO 2 environment . H . pylori strain 60190 from frozen stock was inoculated on blood agar plates with 5 % sheep blood ( Oxoid Biotech , Canada ) . Isogenic mutants lacking the vacA gene were inoculated on Brucella agar plates supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum ( FBS ) ( Gibco BRL Life technologies ) and 20μg / ml kanamycin ( Invitrogen ) . All cultures were incubated at 37°C in a microaerophilic environment for 72h . Cultured H . pylori strains were then grown at 37°C 36 overnight in Brucella broth ( Sigma - Aldrich ) under microaerophilic conditions with shaking at 120 rpm . On the day of infection , bacteria were pelleted and resuspended in Ham’s F12 medium with 10 % serum . Preparation of Concentrated Culture Supernatants The culture supernatants of wt H . pylori 60190 and isogenic mutant vacA - were separated from the bacterial pellet at 4000rpm for 20 min . Supernatants were then filtered through a 0 . 22μm filter and concentrated 10 times in Ham’s F12 media supplemented with 10 % FBS using a 30 kDa cut off Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter ( Millipore , Billerica , MA , USA ) . The culture supernatants are diluted a further 5 times in Ham’s F12 prior to addition to cells for intoxication assays ( Raju and Jones , 2010 ) . Purified VacA Toxin VacA toxin was purified by chromatography ( Willhite et al . , 2003 ) ( obtained from Dr . Steven Blanke , University of Houston , Houston , Texas USA ) and diluted 100 times in Hams F12 , adjusted to pH 2 . 0 using 1 - Normal HCl to acid activate the toxin . Purified toxin was left at 37°C for 30 min followed by neutralization using 1 - Normal NaOH . Toxin is supplemented with 10 % FBS . Prior to addition of activated toxin to cells NH 4 Cl was added ( 5mM ) . Antioxidants and Chemicals Where indicated , cells were pre - treated with several antioxidants for 30 minutes . The following antioxidants were used : Rotenone ( 50μM ) , α - tocopherol ( 100μM ) , diphenylene iodonium ( DPI ; 100 μM ) , n - acetylcysteine ( NAC ; 5mM ) ( all courtesy of the John Brumell’s laboratory , University of Toronto , Toronto , Ontario , Canada ) , and Tempol ( 5mM ; Sigma Aldrich ) . Autophagy Inducers Autophagy was induced by incubating AGS cells in Earle’s balanced salts solution ( EBSS , Gibco ) or with rapamycin ( 25µg / ml ) at 37°C for 4h . Infection Conditions 37 Infection of AGS cells was performed in 6 - well plates when 80 - 90 % confluency was reached . Cells were treated with culture supernatants , purified VacA toxin or inactive VacA toxin for 4h . Where indicated , pretreatment with antioxidants was used for 30 min , followed by subsequent VacA treatments . Upon completion , cells were either lysed for western blotting . Immunoflourescence AGS cells were grown on coverslips or 12 - 24 - well plates . Cells were transfected using FuGENE - 6 ( Roche Diagnostics Indianapolis , Indiana , USA ) as a transfection agent for various plasmids . Plasmids LC3 - GFP , LC3 - RFP ( Obtained from John Brumell’s lab ) Mito - RFP , and Parkin - YFP ( both kindly provided by Dr . Peter Kim , University of Toronto , Toronto , ON , Canada ) were used alone , or in combination as needed . Upon infection completion , cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde for 20 min . Cells were then permeabilized by incubation in 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 ( vol / vol ) in PBS for 20 min , and blocked for 60 min with 5 % milk in PBS ( vol / vol ) . Permeabilized cells were incubated for 1 h with primary antibody at room temperature , washed extensively with PBS buffer , and incubated for 1 h with secondary antibodies . All steps were carried out at room temperature . The following primary antibodies were diluted in 5 % milk in PBS ( vol / vol ) as follows : HSP60 ( 1 : 40 ; Abcam , Cambridge , MA , USA ) , and VacA ( 1 : 100 ; from the Blanke Lab ) , followed by washing in PBS and a Cy3 or Cy5 conjugated secondary antibody ( dilution 1 : 1000 ) . After washing in PBS , the cover slips are then mounted onto microscope slides . Parkin Experiments examining Parkin used Parkin - YFP - transfected cells treated with VacA pure toxin as described above . Rotenone ( 50µM ) was used as positive control for Parkin redistribution . Confocal Microscopy Confocal image acquisition was performed in a Quorum Spinning Disk Confocal Microscope consisting of a Leica DMIRE2 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu Back - Thinned EM - CCD camera and spinning disk confocal scan head , 4 laser lines ( Spectral Applied Research : 405 nm , 491 nm , 561 nm , 638 nm ) , an ASI motorized XY stage , and an Improvision Piezo Focus Drive . The equipment is controlled by Volocity acquisition software 38 ( Improvision ) and powered by an Apple Power Mac G5 ( Terebiznik et al . , 2009 ) . The number of autophagic cells was enumerated in approximately 100 LC3 - GFP transfected cells using the 63X objective . Cells containing more than five visible autophagosomes were considered autophagic . Quantification of Parkin redistribution was also counted in approximately 100 Parkin - YFP transfected cells using the 63X objective . Cells containing visible Parkin puncta were counted as Parkin - redistributed . Immunoblotting AGS cells in 6 well plates were treated for 4 h . Western blotting technique was similar as that used previously in the chapter 3 methods , using GFP polyclonal antibody ( 1 : 1000 ) with a secondary HRP - conjugated anti - rabbit antibody for detection of LC3 - GFP . Reactive Oxygen Species AGS cells were grown in 12 - well plates and treated for 4 h as described . Cells were then washed in PBS 2X , and 300μl of 0 . 25 % trypsin ( Wisnet ) was added until cells detached . Trypsin was neutralized with 300μl Ham’s F12 . Cells were spun at 2500rpm for 10min at room temperature . Cells were washed with buffer containing PBS plus 1 % bovine serum albumin ( BSA ; Sigma Aldrich ) and 0 . 05 % azide . Cells were then incubated with 20mM 5 - ( and - 6 ) - chloromethyl - 2 ' 7 ' - dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate acetyl ester ( CM - H 2 DCFDA ; Invitrogen ) , a dye that remains nonfluorescent until the acetate groups are removed by intracellular esterases and oxidation occurs within the cell . Radical formation was assessed via flow cytometry using a FacsCalibur flow cytometer . Statistics All experiments were performed at least 3 times , and using values obtained , P values were calculated using ANOVA to compare the means ± SE for independent treatment groups . A P value of less than 0 . 05 was determined to be statistically significant . 39 Chapter 3 H . pylori Activates the STAT3 Pathway in DCs , Causing DC Maturation but Altering DC Cytokine Release ABSTRACT H . pylori colonizes the stomach of nearly half the world’s human population and is an important risk factor in the development of gastric cancer . Infection with H . pylori persists for the lifetime of the host , utilizing mechanisms to evade the host immune response . The effect of H . pylori infection on DCs , key orchestrators of the host immune response , is unclear . Recently , our lab demonstrated that H . pylori activates the STAT3 pathway in epithelial cells . STAT3 activation in DCs effects maturation , activation and can subvert tumour immune surveillance . Therefore , we hypothesized that H . pylori activates the STAT3 pathway in DCs , altering maturation , thereby providing a mechanism by which this bacteria evades host immune responses . BMDCs were infected with H . pylori for 4 or 24 hours and activation of STAT3 was assessed by immunoblotting . DC activation and maturation was assessed by flow cytometric analysis and cytokine analysis . Infection of DCs with WT H . pylori resulted in robust PSTAT3 activation compared to control , however this activation was independent of CagA . Activation of PSTAT3 was also seen with heat - killed wild - type bacteria , indicating a possible role for heat stable LPS . STAT3 activation was associated with an induction of DC maturation markers and a cytokine profile of increased IL - 10 : IL - 12 , providing a possible mechanism by which immune evasion occurs . These findings suggest that H . pylori mediated STAT3 activation in DCs promotes an immunoregulatory phenotype which may promote chronic infection and disease . INTRODUCTION Gastric cancer is the second leading cause of cancer - related deaths worldwide ( Peek , Jr . and Crabtree , 2006 ) . As a type I carcinogen , infection with H . pylori is a leading cause of gastric cancer and due to its long term and chronic infection , likely alters host immune response for bacterial survival . Dendritic cells are key players that orchestrate host immune responses . DCs are antigen presenting cells that detect infection through recognition of pathogen associated molecules to either induce or prevent the initiation of adaptive immune responses . In addition to responding to 40 infection , DCs are also involved in tumour surveillance . Classically immature DCs were thought to promote tolerance while mature DCs promote T cell immunity . However , current evidence suggests that DCs can exist in a variety of functional forms with different immunogenic capacities ( Banchereau and Steinman , 1998 ; Tan and O ' Neill , 2005 ) . Based on their ability to regulate both host immune responses and tumour surveillance , the effect of H . pylori infection on DCs has been an area of interest . However , controversy exists with respect to the effect of H . pylori infection on DC function . Several studies suggest that H . pylori can induce DC maturation , upregulating CD80 , CD83 and CD86 surface expression by an as yet unknown mechanism ( Kranzer et al . , 2004 ; Rad et al . , 2007 ) . The functional outcome of this maturation is unclear . Some groups report an increase in DC IL - 12 secretion ( Guiney et al . , 2003 ) and a Th1 response , whereas other groups demonstrate inhibition of DC IL - 12 secretion when compared to other bacteria ( Kao et al . , 2006 ; Obonyo et al . , 2006 ) . Differences in cell lines could contribute to the differences noted by these groups , as Guiney et al . performed experiments on human peripheral blood monocytes treated with IL - 4 , which preferentially polarizes cells toward an IL - 12 / Th1 response ( Guiney et al . , 2003 ) , whereas Kao and Obonyo used BMDCs cultured from mice with IL - 4 treatment ( Kao et al . , 2006 ; Obonyo et al . , 2006 ) . Conversely , others have demonstrated that H . pylori causes gastric epithelial cells to promote thymic stromal lymphopoietin causing increased DC production of IL - 4 and IL - 13 , causing a Th2 response ( Kido et al . , 2010 ) . Recently , it has been suggested that H . pylori induces DCs to secrete factors causing a Treg polarized response through secretions of IL - 10 and TGFβ ( Kao et al . , 2009 ; Romero - Adrian et al . , 2010 ) . Our laboratory has shown that H . pylori activates the STAT3 pathway in epithelial cells ( Bronte - Tinkew et al . , 2009 ) . STAT3 is constitutively activated in many cancer cells but is also increased in infiltrating immune cells . Recent evidence indicates that STAT3 can suppress anti - tumour immunity by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokine secretion and upregulating immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL - 10 and VEGF . STAT3 activation in DCs has been shown to inhibit maturation , as blocking STAT3 increases expression of surface markers MHC class II and CD40 ( Wang et al . , 2004 ) . Blocking STAT3 also induces increased IL - 12 , IL - 10 , TNFα and IL - 6 promoting the development of Treg cells ( Wang et al . , 2004 ) . Additionally , in liver DCs , constitutively elevated IL - 6 and STAT3 levels help inhibit liver DC maturation , preventing robust inflammation in response to commensal bacteria ( Lunz , III et al . , 2007 ) . These 41 studies suggest that , STAT3 contributes to the inhibition of DC maturation , thereby dampening the initiation of robust immune responses by DCs . Therefore , with this body of evidence implicating STAT3 as a modulator of DC function , we wanted to determine if the STAT3 pathway is activated during H . pylori infection and what effects it has on the DC phenotype . RESULTS H . pylori infection induces tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 To determine if H . pylori activates the STAT3 pathway in DCs , we measured phosphorylated STAT3 ( PSTAT3 ) in cell lysates using immunoblotting . Cultured immature BMDCs were infected with H . pylori WT strain 7 . 13 or treated with IL - 6 , a known STAT3 activator , for 4h . Immunoblotting analysis of lysates demonstrated robust activation of PSTAT3 with WT H . pylori infection and IL - 6 treatment in comparison with uninfected control cells ( Figure 3 - 1A , C ) . As we had previously shown that CagA is responsible for STAT3 activation in epithelial cells we next determined if CagA was involved by utilizing the isogenic cagA mutant . Infection with cagA - bacteria increased PSTAT3 in a manner similar to WT ( Figure 3 - 1A ) indicating that phosphorylation of STAT3 is independent of the CagA virulence factor . Next we determined if heat - stable proteins were required by employing heat killed ( HK ) bacteria . In comparison with control cells , lysates from cells infected with HK bacteria showed increased PSTAT3 ( Figure 3 - 1B ) . However the degree of PSTAT3 was decreased in comparison with infection with the wildtype strain , indicating that although heat - stable factors may contribute to STAT3 activation , live WT bacteria are needed for full PSTAT3 activation .

Columns , mean ; bars , SE , * , P < 0 . 05 , using one - way ANOVA ( n = 6 ) . 44 H . pylori induces expression of DC maturation markers We next determined the effect of H . pylori infection on maturation of DCs . BMDCs were infected with WT , HK H . pylori or incubated with IL - 6 or E . coli LPS ( positive control ) for 24h . Flow cytometric analysis was utilized to quantify expression of DC maturation markers CD86 , CD80 , and MHC class II . Cells positive for both MHC class II and one other marker were determined to be activated and mature . To ensure that a pure population of DCs was used , cells were stained and gated for the CD11c + and CD11b + surface markers ( Figure 3 - 2A ) . Cells were also stained for Gr1 to ensure the cells were not granulocytes ( data not shown ) . Infection with WT H . pylori increased the proportion of CD86 + , MHC class II + cells comparable to treatment with LPS ( Figure3 - 2C ) . ( Figure 3 - 2B ) . Infection with HK bacteria also increased the proportion of positive cells albeit to a lesser degree than WT bacteria . Similar results were observed when assessing the markers CD80 + and MHC class II + ( Figure 3 - 2D ) . Infection with WT bacteria increased the proportion of these cells compared to control cells . However , incubation with HK bacteria did not increase the expression of these maturation markers above control cells ( Figure 3 - 2E ) . Incubation with IL - 6 , which activated the STAT3 pathway comparable to H . pylori infection , did not result in increased expression of maturation markers on DCs compared to control cells . These studies demonstrate that H . pylori infection induces DC maturation .

Using a Luminex multiplex panel , we examined a Th1 / Th2 panel of cytokines . Of all the cytokines profiled in this kit ( IL - 2 , IL - 4 , IL - 5 , IL - 10 , IL - 12 , IL - 17 and IFN - γ ) only IL - 12 ( p40 / p70 ) and IL - 10 had levels within detectable limits ( Figure 3 - 3A ) . In comparison with supernatants obtained from either control or IL - 6 treated cells , WT infection increased the levels of both IL - 12 and IL - 10 . Supernatants from DCs incubated with HK bacteria showed a slight increase in IL - 10 secretion but not to the same levels as cells incubated with WT bacteria as results were not statistically significant . When we compared the ratio of IL - 10 : IL - 12 ( Carrieri et al . , 2008 ; Hwang et al . , 2007 ; Stax et al . , 2008 ) infection with WT H . pylori increased the IL - 10 : IL - 12 . In contrast , the proinflammatory E . coli LPS exerted an increased IL - 12 : IL - 10 ratio ( Figure 3 - 3B ) . To further assess the cytokine profiles we employed ELISA - based assays . We first confirmed the increase in IL - 10 and IL - 12 p40 with WT bacteria stimulation with ELISA analysis and an increased immunosuppressive ratio of IL - 10 : IL - 12 ( Figure 3 - 4A , B ) . We could not detect an increase in IL - 12 p70 using the ELISA based assay . Additionally , we also saw an increase in IL - 6 and TNF - α stimulation with WT infection .

B ) Graph depicts ratios of IL - 10 : IL - 12 and IL - 12 : IL - 10 . 52 H . pylori induced DC maturation and cytokine release is dependent on activation of the STAT3 pathway . To determine if the activation of the STAT3 pathway was responsible for the DC phenotype observed , we employed the STAT3 inhibitor S3I - 201 . S3I - 201 specifically inhibits the SH2 domains on STAT3 monomers , preventing dimerization and phosphorylation of the STAT3 pathway . S3I - 201 inhibits constitutive Stat3 DNA - binding and transcriptional activities but has no effect on Src activation or the EGFR - mediated activation of the Erk1 / 2 ( MAPK ) pathway , indicating that this inhibitor is specific for the STAT3 pathway ( Zhang et al . , 2010 ) . Cells were pretreated with S3I - 201 for 30 min followed by incubation with WT bacteria or IL - 6 treatment and the DC phenotype determined . Phosphorylation of STAT3 was inhibited in cells pretreated with the STAT3 inhibitor and infected with WT H . pylori as assessed by immunoblotting ( Figure 3 - 5A ) . In addition , a decrease in expression of the DC maturation markers was observed in comparison to cells infected with WT bacteria alone ( Figure 3 - 5B , n = 2 ) . Furthermore , S3I - 201 pre - treatment prevented H . pylori - mediated secretion of IL - 12p40 , IL - 10 and TNF - α ( Figure 3 - 5C ) . S3I - 201 pre - treatment also resulted in a decrease in levels of IL - 6 , although this did not reach significance .

Despite the increasing interest , the exact mechanisms by which H . pylori affects DC function is not known . In this study , we demonstrate for the first time that H . pylori activates the STAT3 pathway in DCs . Additionally , we show that H . pylori induces DC maturation as assessed by upregulation of the maturation markers MHC class II , CD80 and CD86 . Finally we show that H . pylori infected DCs cytokine profile shows an enhanced IL - 10 : IL - 12 ratio indicating a immunoregulatory phenotype . Both the DC maturation and phenotype was dependent on STAT3 activation suggesting that STAT3 activation in DCs may be a mechanism by which the bacterium subverts the host immune response . We have shown that H . pylori mediated STAT3 activation in DCs occurs independently of the CagA virulence factor and that live bacteria are required for maximal activation . However , our studies also implicate a role for heat stable factors in this activation ( e . g . LPS ) . In support of this finding , Samavati et al . demonstrated that E . coli LPS can activate the STAT3 pathway in RAW 246 . 7 cells and BMDCs , leading to increased IL - 1β , IL - 6 and TNF - α production ( Samavati et al . , 2009 ) . Use of the new inhibitor S3I - 201 , which blocks the phosphotyrosine binding region of the SH2 domain on STAT3 , demonstrates the necessary involvement of STAT3 activation in H . pylori induced DC maturation and cytokine release . Near - complete reversal of DC maturation and cytokine release was seen when cells were pretreated with S3I - 201 before WT incubation , demonstrating for the first time the importance of STAT3 activation in these processes . Although this inhibitor is thought to be specific it remains possible that other nonspecific effects may occur . The use of additional mechanisms to inhibit STAT3 , are now required to confirm the STAT3 dependance on the observed DC phenotype . STAT3 activation in immune cells is thought to have immunosuppressive effects . Lin and collegues have demonstrated that Salmonella enteric serovar Typhimurium activates STAT3 in macrophages , limiting excessive inflammatory responses and providing a hypothesized mechanism of Salmonella ’s immune evasion ( Lin and Bost , 2004 ) . Previous studies have demonstrated that increased STAT3 activation in DCs can limit the inflammatory responses of bacterial products . In liver DCs , STAT3 activation is upregulated . When challenged with 59 bacterial LPS , IL - 6 release is noted , however due to elevated STAT3 , DC activation is limited ( Lunz , III et al . , 2007 ) . STAT3 activation inhibits the production of DC IL - 12 , reducing proinflammatory effects and downregulating the Th1 response ( Wang et al . , 2004 ) . STAT3 inhibits IL - 12p35 gene expression in tumour - associated DCs but the paralysis of tumour DCs into an immature state has been shown to be reversed by blocking IL - 10 activity , allowing de novo IL - 12 production ( Vicari et al . , 2002 ) . Additionally , STAT3 signalling has been linked to decreased tumour surveillance , decreasing the ability of DCs to mature in a tumour environment ( Lin et al . , 2010c ) . STAT3 has also been shown to inhibit DC maturation through the secretion of inhibitory IL - 10 , promoting the development of inhibitory DCs ( Corinti et al . , 2001 ) . Due to the role of STAT3 in directing DC tumour immunosurveillance , our studies may demonstrate a mechanism by which H . pylori alters DC signalling to induce tumourigenesis . In our studies , we see a paradoxical increase in both IL - 10 and IL - 12 with H . pylori stimulated STAT3 activation . However increases were only seen in IL - 12p40 , and not IL - 12p70 ( data not shown ) in our studies . IL - 12p70 is the biologically active form of IL - 12 composed of two covalently linked chains of 40 and 35 kDa ( IL - 12p40 and IL - 12p35 ) and is associated with increased proinflammatory responses . Since in our studies , only IL - 12p40 was induced , we hypothesize that the increase in IL - 12 with H . pylori infection does not induce a pro - inflammatory response due to the lack of IL - 12p70 formation , instead producing only IL - 12p40 . Instead , IL - 10 secretion is of greater importance . We report an increased IL - 10 : IL - 12p40 ratio observed with H . pylori infected DCs when compared to proinflammatory E . coli LPS . These observations indicate a shift in importance from a Th1 - IL - 12 phenotype to an IL - 10 response , especially when noting the lack of IL - 12p70 . TNF - α elevation in response to H . pylori infection seen in our studies may appear contradictory as TNF - α is known to be a proinflammatory cytokine and associated with a Th1 response . However , evidence shows that TNF - α has also been proven to be critical for the generation of IL - 10 producing CD4 + T cells during the antigen presentation by immature DCs , therefore providing an immunosuppressive role for TNF - α in our DCs ( Hirata et al . , 2010 ) . Recently , activation of the STAT3 pathway has been linked to the development of a new class of inflammation , the IL - 23 / Th17 response . The presence of only IL - 12p40 can have increased 60 significance when considering that IL - 23 shares the p40 chain and some properties with IL - 12 and enhances Th17 responses . Reports have indicated that shifts from a anticarcinogenic IL - 12 response to a pro - carcinogenic IL - 23 is regulated through STAT3 signalling , leading to the development of T - regulatory ( Treg ) cells , which would also induce IL - 10 expression ( Kortylewski et al . , 2009 ) . We thus hypothesize that the increase in IL - 10 , IL - 12p40 and IL - 10 : IL - 12 preferentially induces the development of Treg cells and possibly activation of the Th17 pathway . In conclusion , this study indentifies that H . pylori induces activation of the STAT3 signalling pathway in DCs which is responsible for an induction of DC maturation , as well as an altered cytokine profile , shifting the balance toward a potential Treg / Th17 polarization . These studies indicate a novel mechanism by which H . pylori alters the innate immune response to prevent elimination by the host and also potentially subvert tumour surveillance . Thus , the findings from this study set the stage for investigating the effect of STAT3 inhibition on disease outcome during H . pylori infection . 61 Chapter 4 Helicobacter pylori’s VacA Toxin Induces Reactive Oxygen Species Production and Alters Parkin Distribution INTRODUCTION Oxidative stress has been noted in many tumours and is caused by an increase in the generation of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) alongside a decreased ability of the cell to clear these ROS . High levels of ROS are associated with damage of proteins , lipids and DNA and all major cellular constituents , whereas low ROS levels has been linked to the activation of intracellular pathways leading to proliferation , promoting angiogenesis and metastasis ( Droge , 2002 ; Weinberg and Chandel , 2009 ) . ROS generation occurs with oxygen reduction , resulting in the formation of the hydroxyl radical ( •OH ) and superoxide ( •O 2 ) , which are easily integrated into the activation of signalling pathways and react with iron to generate hydroxyl radicals ( Imlay et al . , 1988 ) . Several sources of ROS have been identified . NADPH oxidase is one of the best studied sources of •O 2 , catalyzing the production of •O 2 from oxygen and NADPH ( Lambeth , 2004 ) . The mitochondrial electron transport chain is also a major site of non - enzymatic •O 2 formation , with •O 2 being created at complexes I , II and III . Additionally , the H 2 O 2 created in these steps can be further converted to •OH after contact with iron . Mitochondrial production of ROS is also an important factor for the overall ROS level within a cell because it underlies oxidative damage in many pathologic conditions , contributing to retrograde redox signalling from organelle to the cytosol and the nucleus . Accumulation of mitochondrial derived ROS can lead to lipid peroxidation , mitochondrial dysfunction , apoptosis and necrosis ( Murphy , 2009 ) . Additionally , the ROS produced by the mitochondria have been reported to regulate autophagy and autophagic cell death , as autophagy is induced by rotenone , H 2 O 2 , and superoxide ( Chen and Gibson , 2008 ) . Recently , Parkin a gene first implicated in juvenile Parkinsonism has been shown to be recruited to damaged , depolarized mitochondria selectively targeting these mitochondria for degradation by autophagy ( Narendra et al . , 2008 ) . Parkin is an E3 - ligase , responsible for conjugating ubiquitin to proteins , targeting them for degradation via the ubiquitin - proteasome degradation pathway , where misfolded proteins are transported to aggresomes whose clearance is facilitated by autophagy ( Farrer , 2006 ; Olzmann and Chin , 2008 ) . Mutations in the Parkin gene result in the 62 development of hepatocellular carcinoma , and the loss of Parkin contributes to the overproliferation of hepatocytes ( Ikeuchi et al . , 2009 ) . These combined observations indicate that the Parkin gene may be important in tumourigenesis and cell cycle regulation in epithelial cells ( Farrer , 2006 ) . Studies using Parkin knock - out mice demonstrated deficiencies in proteins involved in mitochondrial function and oxidative stress , including reductions in proteins involved in complexes I and IV ( Palacino et al . , 2004 ) . Parkin deficient mice also exhibited decreased levels of proteins involved in protection from oxidative stress , as well as decreased serum antioxidant capacity and increased protein and lipid peroxidation , indicating that Parkin mutations are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction ( Palacino et al . , 2004 ) . We have shown that H . pylori ’s VacA activates the autophagy pathway . However the exact mechanisms involved remain unknown . VacA localizes to mitochondria where it forms channels in the membrane , reducing mitochondrial transmembrane potential , causing mitochondrial dysfunction and cytochrome c release ( Galmiche et al . , 2000 ; Willhite et al . , 2003 ; Willhite and Blanke , 2004a ) . Therefore , we hypothesized that VacA may induce increased mitochondrial derived ROS and Parkin redistribution to trigger autophagy . Therefore we determined if VacA altered ROS production and Parkin distribution in gastric epithelial cells in vitro . RESULTS H . pylori ’s VacA toxin induces ROS production To determine if VacA increased ROS production , AGS cells were treated for 4 hours with inactive or activated pure toxin and ROS measured using CM - H 2 DCFDA , a compound that fluoresces when in contact with ROS , and assessed by FACS . As a positive control cells were incubated with H 2 O 2 ( 200µM , 40min ) . Activated VacA induced increased ROS production comparable to levels seen in cells treated with H 2 O 2 ( Figure4 - 1B ) . In marked contrast , ROS levels were not increased in cells treated with inactive VacA toxin and resembled control untreated cells ( Figure 4 - 1A , B ) . We next determined if antioxidants could reduce VacA - mediated ROS production . The antioxidants DPI , rotenone and α - tocopherol all failed to prevent ROS induction ( data not shown ) . However , in cells pre - treated with 5mM N - acetyl - cysteine ( NAC ) VacA - mediated ROS was prevented ( Figure 4 - 1A , B ) . Taken together , these results demonstrate that VacA induces the production of ROS , which can be inhibited using NAC treatment .

To determine if VacA induced ROS is responsible for VacA - mediated autophagy , we used immunofluorescence to detect the redistribution of cytosolic LC3I to autophagic , membrane - bound LC3II puncta . AGS cells were transfected with LC3 - GFP plasmid and treated with EBSS starvation conditions ( a potent inducer of autophagy ) , or inactive or activated VacA pure toxin for 4 hours in the presence or absence of NAC . As shown previously , starvation was sufficient to induce the formation of autophagosomes indicated by green puncta formation ( Figure 4 - 2A , arrowheads ) . Similarly active but not inactive VacA induced the formation of LC3 puncta ( Figure 4 - 2A ) . However , treatment with NAC prior to incubation with active VacA did not reduce the percent of autophagic cells ( Figure 4 - 2A , B ) . These results suggest that inhibition of VacA induced ROS does not alter VacA induced autophagy , indicating that ROS production and autophagy induction by VacA occur independently .

Mitochondrial damage can induce mitochondrial specific autophagy ( termed mitophagy ) , particularly if the mitochondrial membrane potential is altered ( Blanke , 2005 ; Kim et al . , 2007b ) . Therefore , due to VacA’s ability to alter the mitochondria , we next determined if VacA induced mitophagy . AGS cells transfected with LC3 - GFP and the mitochondria marker Mito - RFP which fluoresces in viable mitchondria were incubated with VacA pure toxin for 4h . Cells were then stained with HSP60 ( a mitochondrial marker staining the mitochondrial matrix ) antibody with Cy5 conjugation to ensure all mitochondria were labelled . Immunofluorescence was used to determine colocalization of the different markers . Under starvation conditions , LC3 - GFP puncta did not colocalize with mitochondrial markers as seen in the merged image , indicating that the autophagosomes were not associated with the mitochondria ( Figure 4 - 3 ) . Similarly , in cells treated with active purified VacA the majority of autophagosomes did not colocalize with mitochondrial markers ( Figure 4 - 3 ) . Furthermore , NAC pretreatment did not affect the degree of mitochondrial and LC3 colocalization ( Figure 4 - 3 ) . Therefore , VacA induced autophagy does not selectively target mitochondria , to induce mitophagy .

Experiment was performed 3 times with representative images from one experiment shown . 71 H . pylori ’s VacA toxin causes Parkin redistribution that is not dependent on VacA induced autophagy Although we did not demonstrate that VacA induced mitophagy , this process may be cell type specific . Therefore we next determined if VacA mediated effects on mitochondria may alter Parkin distribution . AGS cells were transfected with LC3 - RFP and Parkin - YFP plasmids and infected for 4h . Rotenone ( 50μM ) , which causes inhibition of the electron transport chain at complex II and thus mitochondrial instability , was used as a positive control for Parkin aggregation . Cells were assessed via spinning disc microscopy to determine if Parkin and LC3 aggregates colocalize . As expected , a diffuse cytosolic distribution of LC3 and Parkin was detected in control cells ( Figure 4 - 4A ) . Rotenone induced Parkin redistribution but no change in LC3 compared to control cells ( Figure 4 - 4A ) . Cells treated with inactive toxin resembled control cells , ( Figure 4 - 4A ) . In contrast , in cells incubated with pure toxin LC3 and Parkin were redistributed in aggregates ( Figure 4 - 4A , B ) . However significant colocalization of LC3 and Parkin aggregates was not detected . Furthermore , LC3 and Parkin aggregation was not always seen in tandem , as some cells contain only LC3 aggregation , while others have only Parkin redistribution ( Figure 4 - 4C ) . In addition , NAC treatment which reduced ROS failed to prevent pure toxin induced Parkin redistribution . These results indicate that VacA treatment can cause Parkin redistribution . However VacA’s ability to induce autophagy appears to be independent of Parkin aggregation and VacA induced ROS .

Cells were subsequently stained with HSP60 Cy5 and examined using spinning disc microscopy . Colocalization between Parkin aggregates and mitochondrial antibodies was not detected .

We have shown previously that H . pylori ’s VacA toxin is capable of inducing autophagy in gastric epithelial cells . VacA can affect mitochondria . The toxin localizes to the mitochondria where it forms channels in its membrane , disrupting mitochondrial membrane potential and inducing the release of cytochrome c . Since alterations in mitochondria can induce autophagy we determined if VacA’s mitochondrial effects induce the production of ROS , thereby inducing VacA induced autophagy . In our studies , autophagosomes induced by VacA toxin did not colocalize with mitochondria suggesting that VacA induced autophagy was not specifically targeting the mitochondria for degradation . However , due to VacA’s ability to interact with the mitochondria , we further investigated the role of ROS . The production of ROS has been previously linked with H . pylori infection . Increased reactive oxygen metabolites have been found in H . pylori positive patients , but not in H . pylori negative patients ( Davies et al . , 1994 ) . Additionally , H . pylori induces enhanced production of ROS in gastric cells , and enhances membrane damage ( Bagchi et al . , 1996 ) . H . pylori can also induce the recruitment and activation of monocytes and neutrophils that create ROS ( Mashimo et al . , 2006 ) . H . pylori induces ROS with increasing levels of DCF fluorescence as well showing increasing levels of MitoSOX Red fluorescence , an indicator of mitochondrial superoxide production ( Calvino - Fernandez et al . , 2008 ) . As well , an increase in ROS - mediated DNA oxidation is seen in the gastric mucosa upon H . pylori infection , and these levels are reduced upon H . pylori eradication ( Katsurahara et al . , 2009 ) . Therefore , ROS production in association with H . pylori infection is well established . Our studies are the first to demonstrate that VacA alone can induce ROS production . The origin of these ROS remains unknown . Lack of ROS inhibition by DPI , which specifically blocks NADPH oxidase , indicates that the NOX - 2 pathway is not responsible for ROS production in VacA treatment despite being implicated in other antibacterial autophagic processes ( Huang and Brumell , 2009 ) . We speculate that VacA interaction with mitochondria may be the source of ROS induction . However , further studies are required to define the exact source of ROS . 78 ROS production can induce the autophagic process , with ROS being specifically required to regulate Atg4 activity ( Scherz - Shouval et al . , 2007 ) , and superoxide being responsible for regulating autophagy ( Chen et al . , 2009 ) . However the ROS production in our studies does not seem to play a role in VacA induction of autophagy , as NAC ( a whole - cell antioxidant ) treatment , which reduces ROS did not inhibit VacA induced autophagy . Host cells may induce ROS to limit bacterial replication ( Mastroeni et al . , 2000 ) . VacA increases intracellular bacterial survival , ( Terebiznik et al . , 2006 ) therefore host cells may induce ROS production to limit VacA induced intracellular survival and reduce microbial burden . Since ROS production did not appear to be the cause of VacA induced autophagy , we next looked at the E3 - ligase Parkin to examine if VacA can induce Parkin aggregation . Parkin has recently been linked to autophagy in a mitochondrial specific manner ( Narendra et al . , 2008 ) . Our studies demonstrate that VacA can cause re - distribution of Parkin . These Parkin aggregates did not appear to colocalize with VacA ( data not shown ) or mitochondrial antibodies . The significance of VacA induced Parkin aggregation is not yet known . In summary , we demonstrate that VacA toxin induces ROS production in AGS cells . However these ROS do not mediate autophagy . Parkin aggregation is also seen with VacA incubation , and the implications of this are not yet known . Although the specific mechanisms by which H . pylori induces autophagy are still unknown , knowledge that VacA induces ROS could potentially provide an avenue by which host cells limit VacA bacterial survival . These studies provide the platform for future studies that may elucidate the specific mechanisms by which autophagy is induced , providing more insight into H . pylori ’s effects on host immune response . 79 Chapter 5 Discussion and Future Directions Affecting or altering the host immune response is crucial in the long term infection and survival of H . pylori . Alterations in innate immune signalling ultimately determine the outcome of the bacterial infection , orchestrating the response of secondary T - cells , and coordinating the adaptive immune response . Two key components of the innate immune response are the activation of DCs and the induction of autophagy . Both play crucial roles in detecting and responding to pathogenic bacteria infection and the manipulation of these responses by bacteria are crucial in their survival . In our studies , we determined that H . pylori alters the responses of both the autophagic pathway and the activation of DCs , providing possible mechanisms for immune subversion by the bacterium . In DCs , H . pylori activates STAT3 and induces maturation and activation of a unique phenotype of DCs , differing from that seen with IL - 6 treatment or induced by E . coli LPS . The cytokine profiles induced by H . pylori are skewed to IL - 10 induced immunoregulatory responses , likely preventing robust pro - inflammatory responses and allowing H . pylori to avoid elimination by the host innate immune response . STAT3 regulates the activity of IL - 10 , as STAT3 knock - out DCs are resistant to IL - 10 suppression of DC activation , allowing enhanced inflammatory cytokine secretion ( Melillo et al . , 2010b ) . Thus the increased IL - 10 and STAT3 signalling we detected may be crucial to the regulation of DCs , These developments may assist in producing STAT3 based therapies to prevent H . pylori long term colonization . Our studies also indicate the potential involvement of enhanced IL - 23 secretion in H . pylori infected DCs as discussed in chapter 3 . STAT3 signalling has been linked to the development of a Th17 response , inducing IL - 17 and IL - 23 expression ( Harris et al . , 2007 ; Yang et al . , 2007 ) . IL - 23 has been implicated in other chronic disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , Crohn’s disease and colitis as IL - 23 deficiency or blockade protects from Crohn’s disease as well as human IBD ( Abraham and Cho , 2009 ) . Similarly , the proposed initiation of an IL - 23 / Treg response may be a mechanism by which H . pylori promotes long term and chronic infection . Furthermore , it has been shown that STAT3 signalling within the tumour microenvironment induces IL - 23 , which was shown to be a procarcinogenic cytokine , while inhibiting 80 anticarcinogenic , IL - 12 , thereby shifting the balance of tumour immunity toward carcinogenesis ( Kortylewski et al . , 2009 ) . IL - 23 also has been linked to tumourigenesis and the development of cancer . It has also been demonstrated that IL - 23 has an important role in the production of IL - 17 producing CD8 + T - cells leading to the development of tumourigenesis and disease ( Ciric et al . , 2009 ) . As well , antibody - mediated blockade of the receptor for IL - 23 inhibits Bacteroides fragilis , a commensal colonic bacterium , STAT3 induced colitis , colonic hyperplasia and tumour formation ( Wu et al . , 2009 ) . The STAT3 pathway has been linked to oncogenesis , as STAT3 is persistently activated in many human cancers and transformed cell lines ( Bromberg et al . , 1999 ) . Indeed , STAT3 expression correlates with a poor prognosis in gastric cancer ( Kim et al . , 2009 ) . H . pylori ’s activation of STAT3 in DCs could promote oncogenesis . Recent evidence indicates that dendritic cells can integrate signals from the tumour microenvironment to modulate tumour immunity ( Lin et al . , 2010b ) . STAT3 hyperactivation has been observed in DCs infiltrating tumours and decreases their immunostimulatory capacity thereby facilitating tumour immune evasion ( Cheng et al . , 2003 ) . Indeed , specific targeted deletion of STAT3 in DCs in mice confirms the role for STAT3 as a negative regulator of DC function ( Melillo et al . , 2010a ) . Hyperactivation of STAT3 in DCs increases IL - 10 production , common in the tumour microenvironment and similar to the results we observed in H . pylori treated DCs ( Lin et al . , 2010a ) . Our findings suggest that in addition to epithelial STAT3 activation , STAT3 activation in DCs could also be involved in promotion of carcinogenesis during chronic H . pylori infection . Using a specific STAT3 inhibitor , S3I - 201 we observed a reversal of STAT3 induced DC effects in vitro . Previous studies demonstrate that inhibition of STAT3 with JSI - 124 can inhibit the growth of STAT3 hyperactivated cell lines in mice as well as reduce the tumour burden of melanoma cells ( Blaskovich et al . , 2003 ) . Therefore our studies set the stage for investigating the role of STAT3 as a promoter of a pro - tumour microenvironment due to DC alteration in vivo . Autophagy induction can function as an innate defence mechanism by killing intracellular microorganisms attempting to establish a replicative niche in the host cytoplasm ( Levine and Deretic , 2007 ) . However , previous studies have shown several pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes and Shigella flexneri are able to evade autophagy to promote intracellular survival ( Hussey et al . , 2009 ; Orvedahl and Levine , 2009 ) . Results from our lab suggest that 81 during acute exposure , VacA - induced autophagy reduces the effects of the toxin in host cells . The exact mechanisms by which VacA induces autophagy remain unknown and were the focus of chapter 4 . We did not identify VacA - induced mitophagy but did determine that VacA could also cause redistribution of Parkin , a protein which localizes to damaged mitochondria . Our studies also demonstrated that VacA induces ROS production , however VacA induced autophagy is not dependent on ROS production . The significance of VacA induced ROS is not yet known . Increased ROS levels are known to cause oxidative DNA damage , potentially leading to deregulation of tumour suppressing elements such as p53 , and enhancing tumourigenesis . Thus VacA induced ROS may contribute to H . pylori induced carcinogenesis . Manipulations of the innate immune response have been implicated in shifting the balance to a protumour type of immunity ( Diacovich and Gorvel , 2010 ) . Although H . pylori evades elimination by the host immune response , chronic inflammation is associated with infection . Chronic inflammation has been associated with increased tumour risk , is involved in polarizing immunity toward those effectors that facilitate tumour growth ( Ostrand - Rosenberg , 2008 ) . Thus alteration and manipulation of the innate immune response by H . pylori can not only result in successful immune evasion thereby promoting chronic infection and also promoting tumourigenesis . Overall , our results demonstrate new and novel mechanisms by which H . pylori may alter the host immune response to promote long term survival . By unravelling the various mechanisms by which H . pylori alters the innate immune response there will be a greater understanding into its colonization , chronic infection and disease outcomes , leading to the development of new preventative and treatment strategies . FUTURE DIRECTIONS The results of our studies investigating the effects of H . pylori infection on DCs have uncovered several future directions that need to be addressed . To further define the mechanism of STAT3 mediated DC activation , a more specific STAT3 inhibitor , SFI - 001 , has been developed , which binds the SH2 domains on STAT3 monomers . This new inhibitor can more definitively demonstrate if STAT3 is responsible for the DC phenotype we observe . 82 Due to the postulated involvement of IL - 23 , it would also be of interest to examine DC secretion for presence of IL - 23 . At the time of our studies , a mouse IL - 23 kit was not available to us , however examination of this cytokine would be a crucial next step . Another future consideration would look into the functional effect of H . pylori infected DCs on T - cells to definitively determine if these DCs would lead to the development of T - regulatory cells . H . pylori stimulated DCs could be incubated with T - cells to determine the effects on T - cell proliferation , cytokine secretion , and finally determining the overall T - cell polarization . It would also be of interest to determine if the DC cytokine secretion we observed would be sufficient to polarize T - cells to Treg cells . T - cells could be stimulated with DC supernatant secretion and assessed for functional changes . Mellilo and colleagues have recently developed a DC targeted STAT3 conditional knock - out ( CKO ) mouse to determine specific effects of STAT3 in DCs ( Melillo et al . , 2010c ) . Using these DCs , we could further define the role of STAT3 activation by H . pylori . To extend these studies to human subjects STAT3 activation in DCs could be confirmed via immunofluorescence in tissue sections of H . pylori infected stomachs . The purpose and importance of VacA induced ROS needs additional study as well . The role of ROS as a mechanism to limit intracellular bacterial survival could be assessed , using intracellular survival assays to determine if inhibiting ROS leads to increased bacterial survival . Other aspects of VacA induced ROS should also be examined , as the mechanism of ROS production is not yet known . The lack of ROS inhibition by DPI , suggests that ROS production is not dependant on the NOX / NADPH pathway . Use of other antioxidants could be used to characterize the ROS , as well as examination via RTPCR for upregulation of genes related to oxidative stress . The effects of VacA on endogenous Parkin needs further study . Little is known about the potential effects of Parkin in epithelial cells as most studies focus on neuronal cells . Additionally , although we did not see colocalization of VacA with Parkin at 4h , later timepoints should be assessed to confirm these findings . Additionally , to determine the relevance of Parkin aggregation siRNA to inhibit Parkin or essential autophagy genes would allow us to determine definitively if Parkin redistribution is linked to the autophagy pathway , or if autophagy is essential for Parkin redistribution . Finally , it would also be important to confirm these findings in tissue sections to determine if Parkin aggregation plays a role in H . pylori infected tissues . 83 References References Abraham , C . and Cho , J .
