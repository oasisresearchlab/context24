McCandless 1 Received : 11 July 2019 / Accepted : 13 April 2020 # The Canadian Public Health Association 2020 Abstract Objectives To examine the relation between prenatal urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations and preterm birth ( PTB ) . Methods The data were drawn from the Maternal - Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals ( MIREC ) Study , a pan - Canadian cohort of 1857 pregnant women enrolled between 2008 and 2011 . We quantified urinary concentrations of 7 phthalate metabolites that were detected in > 70 % of urine samples collected during the first trimester . Gestational age was obtained from either the last menstrual period or early ultrasound . We used Cox proportional hazard models to examine the associations of urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations , plus the molar sum of di - 2 - ethylhexyl phthalate metabolites ( ∑ DEHP ) , with time to delivery before 37 weeks of gestation . We also examined PTB by clinical presentation . PTBs presented with either spontaneous labour or premature rupture of the membrane were considered spontaneous PTB ( sPTB ) . Additionally , we used multiple linear regression to model changes in mean gestational age in relation to phthalate exposure . Results We found no evidence of an association between first trimester phthalate metabolite concentrations and PTB among the MIREC study participants . For example , each 2 - fold increase in any of the 7 phthalate concentrations or ∑ DEHP was associated with hazard ratios ( HRs ) for PTB ranging from 0 . 95 to 1 . 07 with 95 % confidence intervals including the null . An assessment of non - linear trends showed some evidence of non - monotonic dose - response relationships between phthalates and PTB . Furthermore , male infants exposed to MCPP showed higher sPTB risk compared with female infants . Conclusion Phthalate exposure during early pregnancy is not clearly associated with the risk of PTB among this Canadian population .

Produits chimiques dans l ’ environnement Introduction Preterm birth ( PTB ) is a public health priority . Complications of PTB are the largest contributor to infant mortality , respon - sible for more than two thirds of all perinatal deaths and three quarters of all serious neonatal morbidity ( Martin et al . 2018 ) . In the United States ( US ) , from 1981 to 2006 , PTB risk in - creased by 33 % . It peaked in 2006 with an average rate of 12 . 8 % and declined steadily until 2014 . Between 2014 and 2017 , PTB rate increased steadily from 9 . 5 % to 9 . 9 % ( Martin et al . 2018 ) . Meanwhile , in Canada , PTB rate increased by 20 % in the past two decades and peaked in 2008 with an average rate of 8 . 0 % . By 2013 , the average rate decreased minimally where it accounted for 7 . 8 % of live births ( Martin et al . 2018 ) . Many risk factors , including advanced maternal age , race , and low pre - pregnancy body - mass index ( BMI ) , have been implicated in PTB , but risk factors for most PTBs are unknown ( Institute of Medicine et al . 2007 ; Simhan et al . 2014 ) . There is a growing concern that environmental contam - inants may play a role in PTB . Phthalates , synthetic chemicals used in a wide variety of consumer and industrial products , have been linked to the risk of PTB ( Boss et al . 2018 ; Ferguson et al . 2014b ; Meeker et al . 2009 ) . Phthalates are plasticizers used in food packaging , vi - nyl flooring , and medical devices . They are also used as ex - cipients in time - release drugs , and as solvents to retain scents in personal care products . Human exposure to phthalates is widespread and the routes of exposure include ingestion , in - halation , dermal contacts , and in utero transfer from mother to fetus via the placenta ( Ferguson et al . 2013 ) . Phthalates may affect PTB via three possible mechanisms : endocrine disruption , oxidative stress , and inflammation . Phthalates are endocrine disruptors that can interfere with key en - dogenous hormones critical in maintaining uterine quies - cence during pregnancy ( Challis et al . 2000 ; McLean et al . 1995 ; Wadhwa et al . 2004 ) . Phthalate exposure may increase oxidative stress levels which can result in poor placentation or cause damage leading to premature rupture of the membranes ( PROM ) ( Longini et al . 2007 ; Meeker et al . 2009 ) . Finally , phthalate exposure may heighten systemic or intrauterine inflammatory responses , which could increase oxidative stress and induce a se - quence of events leading to premature parturition ( Challis et al . 2009 ; Ferguson and Chin 2017 ) . Studies of the impact of prenatal phthalate exposure on PTB or gestational age ( GA ) have produced inconsistent results according to a comprehensive review by Ferguson et al . ( 2013 ) and the 7 additional studies published since 2012 ( Figures S1 in the Supplementary Materials ) ( Bloom et al . 2019 ; Boss et al . 2018 ; Ferguson et al . 2014b ; Gao et al . 2019 ; Shoaff et al . 2016 ; Watkins et al . 2016 ; Weinberger et al . 2014 ) . The studies were mostly US - based and varied by sample size ( from fewer than 100 births up to 500 ) , timing of exposure , choice of measured phthalate metabolites , outcome assessment , and statistical methods . Therefore , this study aimed to further the knowledge , especially within a Canadian context , by ex - amining the associations between urinary phthalate me - tabolite concentrations measured during the first trimester of pregnancy and PTB in a large cohort of Canadian w o m e n i n t h e M at er na l - I n f a nt Re s ea r c h o n Environmental Chemicals ( MIREC ) Study . 334 Can J Public Health ( 2020 ) 111 : 333 – 341 Methods Study participants Data were drawn from the MIREC Study , a national - level cohort study of 1857 pregnant women recruited between 2008 and 2011 from ten Canadian cities . The goal of the MIREC Study was to obtain Canadian biomonitoring data on pregnant women and to examine associations between pre - natal exposure to environmental chemicals and pregnancy and child health outcomes ( Arbuckle et al . 2013 ) . Eligibility criteria and exclusions are described in Arbuckle et al . ( 2013 ) . For the present study , we included all women who had complete socio - demographic information , provided bio - logical samples during the first trimester of the pregnancy , and delivered singleton live births . Preterm birth and duration of gestation Gestational age ( GA ) at delivery was calculated based on last menstrual period ( LMP ) or first trimester ultrasound . If LMP and ultrasound date differed by less than or equal to seven days , the LMP date was used ; otherwise , the ultrasound date was used ( Kieler et al . 1993 ) . Births less than 37 completed gestational weeks were considered preterm . We also examined PTB by clinical presentation . We defined spontaneous PTB ( sPTB ) as either spontaneous preterm labour or with preterm PROM ( pPROM ) . All information was obtained from medical records . Prenatal phthalate exposure assessment We measured eleven phthalate metabolite concentrations in urine samples collected from MIREC participants during the first trimester of pregnancy . Biomarker analysis took place at the Toxicology Laboratory of the Institut national de santé publique du Québec using methods previously described ( Langlois et al . 2014 ) . We retained the seven phthalate metab - olites that were detected in at least 70 % of the samples ana - lyzed ( Lubin et al . 2004 ) including mono - 2 - ethylhexyl phthal - ate ( MEHP ) , mono - ( 2 - ethyl - 5 - hydroxyhexyl ) phthalate ( MEHHP ) , mono - ( 2 - ethyl - 5 - oxohexyl ) phthalate ( MEOHP ) , mono - ( 3 - carboxypropyl ) phthalate ( MCPP ) , mono - benzyl phthalate ( MBzP ) , mono - ethyl phthalate ( MEP ) , and mono - n - butyl phthalate ( MnBP ) . Measurements below the limit of detection ( LOD ) were replaced using the single imputation “ fill - in ” approach where the log2 - phthalate concentrations < LOD were randomly sampled from a truncated lognormal distribution with mean and standard deviation estimated from the observed data ( Lubin et al . 2004 ) . The “ fill - in ” approach for missing biomarkers yields unbiased regression coefficient estimates if the imputation distribution is correct , although standard errors may be biased . To account for individual - level variability in urinary hydra - tion levels , all phthalate metabolite concentrations were stan - dardized by specific gravity ( SG ) using the following formula : P c ¼ P SG median − 1 ð Þ = SG − 1 ð Þ ½ (cid:2) ; where P c represents the SG - standardized phthalate metabolite concentration ( μ g / L ) , P represents the measured urinary con - centration , SG median ( i . e . , 1 . 013 ) is the median SG of all sam - ples measured , and SG represents the SG of the individual sample ( Meeker et al . 2009 ) . Standardization by the formula was only applied when presenting the descriptive statistics on the metabolite concentrations . Otherwise , SG was included as a covariate in all regression models ( Barr et al . 2005 ) . Finally , we summed di - 2 - ethylhexyl phthalate ( DEHP ) me - tabolites ( i . e . , MEHHP , MEHP , and MEOHP ) by dividing each metabolite concentration by its molecular weight and then sum - ming them to calculate the molar sums of DEHP metabolites ( ∑ DEHP ) . The formula is given by ( Hauser et al . 2016 ) MEHP (cid:3) 1 = 278 : 34 ð Þ ½ (cid:2) þ MEHHP (cid:3) 1 = 294 : 34 ð Þ ½ (cid:2) þ MEOHP (cid:3) 1 = 292 : 33 ð Þ ½ (cid:2) Covariates We examined variables that may potentially confound the re - lationship between urinary phthalate metabolite concentra - tions and PTB . We created a directed acyclic graph ( Figure S2 ) to identify predictors of PTB and factors associ - ated with both phthalate exposure and PTB ( Hernan 2002 ) . The following covariates derived from the baseline question - naire were examined : maternal age ( under 25 , ≥ 25 to < 30 , ≥ 30 to < 35 , ≥ 35 to < 40 , and ≥ 40 ) , race ( white , non - white ) , education ( high school diploma or less , college or trade school diploma , undergraduate university degree , and graduate uni - versity degree ) , marital status ( married , same partner ≥ 1 year , single , and others ) , smoking status ( never , current , former , and quit during pregnancy ) , parity ( 0 , 1 , 2 , ≥ 3 ) , and pre - pregnancy BMI ( underweight , normal , overweight , and obese ) . The same set of covariates was used in all analyses . Analytical approach Participant characteristics were tabulated and geometric means ( GM ) and percentiles of the phthalate metabolite con - centrations were calculated . To reduce the effects of the right skewed distributions , the metabolite concentrations were log2 transformed before inclusion in the regression models . Log2 - transformation was specifically chosen for easy interpretation ( i . e . , a two - fold increase ) . Our primary analysis involved analyzing gestational age ( GA ) as a time - to - event outcome to examine the relationship 335 Can J Public Health ( 2020 ) 111 : 333 – 341 between urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations and PTB . We used Cox proportional hazards regression , adjusted for po - tential confounders , to examine the relationship of the 7 indi - vidual urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations plus ∑ DEHP with time to delivery before 37 weeks . We computed the hazard ratios ( HRs ) to compare the hazard of PTB relative to a two - fold increase in phthalate metabolite concentrations ( Yau Fu and Liu 2002 ) . If GA was less than 37 weeks , then GAwas taken as the time to event . Full - term births at 37 weeks or later were treated as censored observations . The analysis assumed that the effects of the exposure upon survival are con - stant over time for GA < 37 weeks , and we tested the propor - tional hazards assumption using a test of the scaled Schoenfeld residuals ( Fox 2002 ) . Prior studies have examined GA as a time - to - event outcome in the analysis of PTB with no censoring of births at 37 weeks ( e . g . , Mitchell et al . 2016 ) . However , this approach assumes proportional hazards throughout the entire range of GA ( e . g . , using a parametric proportional hazards model ) unless time - dependent covariates are included . We also examined the risk of sPTB . In this case , sPTB was the event , whereas indicated PTBs , PTBs with missing clinical presentation , and full - term births were censored observations . To check for non - linear trends , we repeated the Cox proportion - al hazards regression analysis with phthalate metabolite expo - sure concentrations considered in quartiles . Additionally , we conducted stratified analysis to examine the potential modify - ing effects of infant sex on the relationship between phthalate metabolite concentrations and both PTB and sPTB . Our secondary analysis examined all GAs as a continuous outcome variable in relation to phthalate metabolite concen - trations using multiple linear regression adjusted for con - founders . The beta coefficient describes the change in mean GA , measured in weeks , associated with a 2 - fold increase in urinary phthalate metabolite concentration . We used residual plots to check for violations of assumptions . All analyses were conducted using R version 3 . 6 . 0 ( 2019 - 04 - 26 ) . Ethics approval This research was approved by the ethics review boards from Health Canada , Sainte - Justine Research Centre , and Simon Fraser University . All study participants provided informed consent . Results Descriptive statistics A total of 1857 MIREC participants were included in the analysis ( Table 1 ) . The women were generally white ( 81 . 7 % ) , ≥ 30 years of age ( 69 . 6 % ) with at least an undergraduate degree ( 62 . 3 % ) , either married or in a stable relationship ( 95 . 3 % ) , had never smoked ( 61 . 3 % ) , and had normal BMI ( 60 . 5 % ) . Characteristics that were predictive of lower GA included being non - white , advanced maternal age , underweight or obese , having lower educational attainment , and increased parity . The missing observations for all socio - demographic variables were less than 1 % except for pre - pregnancy BMI with 138 ( 7 . 4 % ) observations missing . Of the participants , 127 ( 6 . 8 % ) were PTB and 86 ( 67 . 7 % ) of these were sPTB . There were 77 sPTB events after 297 ( 16 . 0 % ) MIREC participants were deleted from the analysis due to missing information on socio - demographic character - istics , chemical concentrations , and clinical presentation . There is some evidence that a number of risk factors such as maternal age , marital status , maternal educational attainment , parity , and pre - pregnancy BMI ( Institute of Medicine et al . 2007 ; Simhan et al . 2014 ) may be associated with PTB and sPTB , although caution is warranted in the interpretation due to imprecise CIs ( Table S1 ) . Primary analysis of Cox proportional hazards regression and PTB In the Cox proportional hazards regression analyses ( Table 3 ) , a 2 - fold increase in urinary phthalate metabolite concentra - tions was associated with unadjusted HRs for PTB that ranged from as low as 0 . 92 to as high as 1 . 07 . The HRs changed minimally and remained close to 1 when comparing adjusted with unadjusted models . For instance , a two - fold increase in ∑ DEHP resulted in an HR of 0 . 98 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 83 , 1 . 14 ) in the unadjusted model versus 0 . 99 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 83 , 1 . 16 ) in the adjusted model . We also estimated the HRs for the probability of sPTB that were associated with a 2 - fold change in phthalate metabolite concentrations ( Table 3 ) . The unadjusted models had HRs for sPTB ranging from 0 . 98 to 1 . 12 , whereas the adjusted HRs ranged from 0 . 98 to 1 . 10 . For both PTB and sPTB , no depar - tures from proportional hazards in relation to log2 - transformed phthalate metabolite concentrations were detect - ed with Schoenfeld residual - based tests . The assessment of non - linear trends in the relationship be - tween phthalate metabolite concentrations and PTB showed non - monotonic associations with wide 95 % CIs ( Table S2 and Figure S3 ) . The adjusted HRs of PTB in the second quartile ( Q2 ) of MBP , MEHHP , and ∑ DEHP were higher compared with the first quartile ( Q1 ) and had significant HRs ranging from 2 . 0 to 2 . 5 for PTB . For MCPP , the adjusted HRs of PTB for all quartiles were at least twice as high compared with Q1 with HRs ranging from 2 . 00 to 2 . 72 . When the quartiles were examined in relation to sPTB risk , some of the trends became stronger and some HRs associated with Q2 versus Q1 increased . 336 Can J Public Health ( 2020 ) 111 : 333 – 341 Tables S3 and S4 show that a 2 - fold increase in MCPP con - centration was associated with adjusted HRs of 1 . 19 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 00 , 1 . 41 ) and 0 . 85 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 65 , 1 . 13 ) for male and female infants , respectively , with a product interaction p value of 0 . 57 . Secondary analysis of linear regression and GA The associations between a two - fold increase in phthalate me - tabolite concentrations and the change in the mean GA in weeks are summarized in Table 4 . All phthalate metabolites and ∑ DEHP were associated with small changes in the mean GA . A doubling of phthalate metabolite concentrations was associated with changes in GA ranging from – 0 . 03 to 0 . 01 weeks and the adjusted estimates differed minimally . For example , for ∑ DEHP , the shift in mean GA was – 0 . 03 weeks ( 95 % CI : − 0 . 09 , 0 . 04 ) and the adjusted effect decreased slight - ly to – 0 . 04 weeks ( 95 % CI : − 0 . 10 , 0 . 03 ) . The multiple regres - sion analysis assumptions were checked and met .

The HRs for PTB ranged from 0 . 95 to 1 . 07 with 95 % confidence intervals ( CIs ) ranging from 0 . 81 to 1 . 21 for a doubling of urinary phthal - ate metabolite concentrations . In a relatively recent study , when asked about the minimal clinically meaningful effect sizes , Canadian obstetricians reported that a minimum of one week increase in GAwas required before they would consider chang - ing their current treatment methods to prevent PTB ( Ross et al . 2012 ) . Small relative effect sizes and an exposure shift of < 1 day in GA are arguably not clinically meaningful ( Olivier et al . 2017 ; Ross et al . 2012 ) . Consequently , the 95 % CIs in Tables 3 and 4 rule out important differences in the association between phthalate exposure and PTB . However , the HRs in Table 3 are scale dependent , and we would obtain larger effect estimates using other log transformations of the metabolite con - centrations ( e . g . , log10 ) . Furthermore , small effects may have important significance when we consider the entire populations ( Bellinger 2007 ; Rose 1981 ) . Nonetheless , Table S2 showed some evidence of a non - monotonic dose - response relationship between phthalate me - tabolite concentrations and PTB . When the analysis was lim - ited to modelling the hazards of sPTB , some of the trends became stronger . However , due to the small sample size of each quartile , the effect estimates were imprecise and caution is warranted in the interpretation of results . In our analysis of effect modification , we found that infant sex modified the relationship between MCPP and sPTB ( p value = 0 . 57 ) . In the literature , among studies that modeled associations of phthalate exposure with PTB stratified by infant sex , incon - sistent results were reported ( Shoaff et al . 2016 ; Watkins et al . 2016 ; Weinberger et al . 2014 ) . Watkins et al . ( 2016 ) found that first trimester phthalate metabolite concentrations , which were generally lower than that of MIREC ’ s ( Table 2 ) , were associated with decreases in mean GA of – 0 . 75 to – 2 . 18 days . Other studies also reported reductions in GA or increased odds of PTB in relation to phthalate metabolite concentrations ( Boss et al . 2018 ; Ferguson et al . 2014b ; Gao et al . 2019 ; Meeker et al . 2009 ; Whyatt et al . 2009 ) . Ferguson et al . ( 2014b ) found that a ln - unit increase in MEHP or ∑ DEHP was associated with in - creased odds of PTB while a ln - unit increase in MEHP , MEOHP , DEHP , MBP , or MCPP was associated with in - creased odds of sPTB ( Ferguson et al . 2014b ) . Whyatt et al . ( 2009 ) observed among ethnic women in America a decrease of up to − 0 . 18 weeks ( 95 % CI : − 0 . 32 , − 0 . 03 ) in GA per log - unit increase in DEHP or its metabolites . Meanwhile , Meeker et al . ( 2009 ) , in a small nested case - control study in Mexico , found increased odds of PTB with third trimester MBP and MCPP . Furthermore , Gao et al . ( 2019 ) reported increased odds of PTB with increasing phthalate metabolite concentra - tions and Boss et al . ( 2018 ) , using survival analysis , reported an increase in probability for PTB in women with higher MBzP , MBP , or MCPP concentrations compared with those with lower concentrations . Our results are contrary to prior studies where increasing phthalate metabolite concentrations during pregnancy were associated with small increases in GA . For example , Wolff et al . ( 2008 ) found that third trimester phthalate metabolite concentrations were associated with increasing GA . For in - stance , a ln - unit increase in MEHP was associated with a 0 . 15 - week ( 95 % CI : 0 . 02 , 0 . 29 ) increase in GA . Adibi et al . ( 2009 ) also reported an association between a ln - unit increase in DEHP metabolites and a 0 . 16 to 0 . 19 week increase in GA . Recently , Shoaff et al . ( 2016 ) reported that MCPP was asso - ciated with increases in GA . Differences in study design , statistical methodology , and exposure assessment such as the timing of the urinary phthal - ate metabolite measurements and the differences in exposure levels could account for the discrepancies between our find - ings and those of previous studies . Women in the MIREC Study had lower phthalate metabolite concentrations during the first trimester compared with the levels previously report - ed such as those in the nested case - control study ( n = 130 cases ; 352 controls ) of Ferguson et al . ( 2014b ) . Nonetheless , the 75th percentile of phthalate levels in the MIREC Study were equal to or greater than the geometric mean ( GM ) from earlier studies ( Adibi et al . 2009 ; Ferguson et al . 2014b ; Whyatt et al . 2009 ) . For example , for MBP , which has been associated with PTB in Ferguson et al . ( 2014b ) , the 75th per - centile concentration was 20 . 8 μ g / L in MIREC versus the GM of 16 . 7 μ g / L in Ferguson et al . ( 2014b ) . This suggests that , although study methodology may differ , at least 464 MIREC participants ( 25 % × 1857 participants ) had phthalate metabo - lite concentrations greater than the GM of Ferguson et al . ( 2014b ) where decrements in GA and PTB were previously observed . Despite the overlapping exposure concentrations in our study versus that of Ferguson et al . ( 2014b ) , no associa - tions were observed in the MIREC cohort . This study has several limitations . First , we only had first trimester spot urine phthalate metabolite measurements and had assumed that the measurements reasonably represent the exposure during the critical window of organ development in the first trimester . Phthalates , however , are non - persistent chemicals that metabolize quickly and most of the measured urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations , except for MEP and MBzP , had low reported intraclass correlation throughout pregnancy ( Fisher et al . 2015 ) . Therefore , exposure misclas - sification may exist and repeated urine measurements may better classify gestational exposure . Furthermore , timing of exposure measurements may also be important in the etiology of PTB ( Ferguson et al . 2014a ) . 338 Can J Public Health ( 2020 ) 111 : 333 – 341 Second , although Cox proportional hazards regression accounted for the effects of time and confounders , it did not account for co - pollutant confounding and interactions among phthalate metabolites or other chemicals the women were ex - posed to . Our linear regression analysis also ignored the effect of combined exposure to multiple phthalate metabolites on GA . Although we calculated ∑ DEHP , it did not fully charac - terize the combined effect of multiple phthalate metabolites . Instead , we could consider machine learning methods such as the Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression ( Bobb et al . 2015 ) , which can incorporate several phthalate metabolites into the same model . Third , linear regression may not be suitable for examining the association between phthalate exposure and GA , which may not be linear and showed non - monotonic trends in risk of PTB when examined by quartiles ( Table S2 ) . However , the drawbacks of categorizing continuous predictors are well known , and , in par - ticular , the choice of cut points is somewhat arbitrary and manip - ulable ( Harrell and Jr . 2015 ) . Furthermore , instead of checking for non - linear trends by categorizing phthalate metabolite concentra - tions into quartiles , splines could be used which permit hypothe - sis testing for nonlinearity ( Steenland and Deddens 2004 ) . A further limitation of our analysis is that missing values may bias the effect estimates and the MIREC Study may not Table 2 Distributions of first trimester specific gravity standardized urinary phthalate metabolite concentrations among MIREC study participants ( n = 1857 ) in Canada , 2008 – 2011 , including geometric means from Canadian Health Measures Survey 2009 – 2011 and Watkins et al .

If a 2 - fold increase in phthalate metabolite concentration ( e . g . , MEHP ) multiplies the risk of PTB by 1 . 5 ( estimated from Figure S1 ) , then , when comparing two independent samples with the frequency of PTB among the Canadian population at 8 % ( Martin et al . 2018 ) , we require 69 PTBs per group ( 138 in total ) to detect a statistically significant difference in proportions with β = 0 . 2 and α = 0 . 05 ( Rosner 2015 ) . This indicates low power because our analysis included only 115 PTBs , and additionally , the true relative risks may be less than 1 . 5 . Nonetheless , compared with prior studies , the MIREC Study is one of the largest studies available to examine phthalate exposure in relation to GA . MIREC , with its large sample size and a large number of PTB and sPTB events , enables us to obtain , in our primary analysis , more precise estimates of effects with relatively narrow 95 % CIs . Results in Table S1 show that we are able to observe the effects of established risk factors for PTB ( Institute of Medicine et al . 2007 ; Simhan et al . 2014 ) , which demonstrates that MIREC is able to measure unbiased estimators of population parameters . Therefore , regardless of the amount of power , the data in Tables 3 and 4 provide unbiased estimates of the relationships in the data and statistical signifi - cance should not be the sole criteria for evaluating quantitative research ( Amrhein et al . 2019 ) . In conclusion , our main analysis indicated no evidence of associations between first trimester maternal urinary phthalate exposure and PTB in a large prospective cohort of Canadian pregnant women . However , we found some evidence of non - monotonic dose - response relationships between MCPP quartiles and both PTB and sPTB . We also found limited evidence of increased sPTB risk in male infants exposed to MCPP , although the interaction effect was not statistically significant . Nevertheless , the current scientific evidence of the effects of phthalate exposure on PTB remains inconsistent . Further studies with multiple exposure measurements during the first trimester may reduce within - individual variability and improve the validity of the results .
