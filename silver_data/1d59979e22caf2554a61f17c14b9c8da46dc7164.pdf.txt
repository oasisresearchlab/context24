It is activated by Ca2 + and inhibited by polyphosphoinositides ( PPI ) . We have pre - viously shown that PPI inhibit actin filament severing by the amino - terminal half of gelsolin and hypothe - sized that this is mediated through inhibition of actin filament side binding ( by domains 11 - 111 of gelsolin ) , a requisite first step in severing . In this paper , we report that the subsequent step in severing , which is mediated by an actin monomer binding site located in domain I of gelsolin , is also regulated by PPI . We used deletional mutagenesis and a synthetic peptide to locate the se - quence required for high affinity PPI binding in do - main I . Our results show that the PPI - binding sequence has a basic charge distribution that is also present in the PPI - regulated actin filament side binding domain , and the two gelsolin PPI - binding sites have similar PPI - binding affinities . In addition , a similar motif is present in several other PPI - binding proteins , includ - ing a highly conserved region in the phospholipase C family . We propose that the sequences identified in gelsolin may represent a consensus for PPI binding in a variety of proteins . There is increasing evidence that membrane polyphospho - inositides ( PPI ) ’ , which are precursors for intracellular second messengers , may also have direct regulatory functions . PIP and PIPz modulate the activity of a number of actin regulatory proteins ( 1 - 7 ) . Among these , the highly specific interactions of PPI with the gelsolin family of proteins ( 2 , 4 , 8 , 9 ) and profilin ( 1 , 10 ) have been most well characterized . Unlike the majority of lipid binding actin regulatory proteins ( 7 ) , gelsolin and profilin bound preferentially to PPI , have much reduced affinity for phosphatidylinositol , and are not inhibited by phosphatidylserine , - ethanolamine , or - choline ( 1 , 2 , 11 ) . PPI inhibit gelsolin and profilin binding to actin , and these pro - teins may in turn modulate PIP , metabolism by sequestering / releasing PIPp ( 10 , 11 ) . Following agonist stimulation , gelsolin ( 12 ) and profilin ( 13 ) translocate toward the plasma mem - brane and can mediate agonist - induced responses at the mem - HL29113 ( H . L . Y . ) and AR38910 ( P . A . J . ) . The costs of publication * This work was supported by National Institutes of Health Grants of this article were defrayed in part by the payment of page charges .

The abbreviations used are : PPI , polyphosphoinositides ; PIP * , phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ; SDS , sodium dodecyl sulfate ; PAGE , polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ; PC , phosphatidylcholine . brane - cytoskeletal interface . Both proteins bind multiple PPI cooperatively ( 14 , 15 ) to form high affinity complexes . Al - though binding is likely to involve electrostatic interactions , the specificity for PPI and not other charged molecules ( 1 , 2 , 10 ) suggests that binding requires a particular geometry for the distribution of the phosphoinositide head groups relative to that of basic residues on the proteins . The PPI - binding site ( s ) of gelsolin is located in the amino - terminal half of gelsolin that severs actin filaments in a PPI - regulated manner ( 9 , 16 - 18 ) . This half contains three semiconserved repeating domains ( 23 ) that appear to act cooperatively to cause sever - ing ( 16 - 22 ) ; gelsolin first attaches laterally to actin filaments through an actin - binding site located within its domains II - I11 ( ( human plasma gelsolin ( GS ) , residues 150 - 406 ) ) and then breaks the actin - actin bond via another actin - binding site located in domain I ( GS1 - 149 ; this will be referred to as GS149 ) ( Fig . 5A ) . We found that PPI prevented domains II - I11 binding to actin filaments and therefore hypothesized that PPI inhibit severing through the side binding domain ( 21 ) . This was supported by the findings that a truncated gelsolin ( GS160 ) that contains domain I and 10 amino acids from domain I1 severed actin filaments in a PPI - regulated manner ( 23 ) and that synthetic peptides derived from the amino - terminal residues of domain I1 of gelsolin and villin , a related protein ( 24 ) , bound PPI vesicles and micelles ( 25 ) . These peptides were more potent than several other unrelated basic peptides with more negatively charged residues , suggesting that in addition to charge , specific aspects of the primary and secondary structure of the gelsolin / villin domain I1 peptides are important for their interaction with the acidic head groups of PPIs . In this paper , we report that domain I of gelsolin is also inhibited by PPI . Its PPI - binding site is distinct from the actin - binding site . PPI binding is localized to between resi - dues 135 - 149 by deletional mutagenesis and competition with a synthetic peptide . The existence of multiple PPI - binding sites , as well as actin - binding sites , allows stringent and differential regulation of gelsolin activity in response to changes in PPI concentrations . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Gelsolin Truncation and Expression Constructs Generation of Truncated Gelsolin Expression Constructs - pLc - IIFXGS , a human plasma gelsolin expression vector ( kindly provided by Drs . M . Way and A . Weeds ( 19 ) ) was linearized at the Hind111 site , blunted , and ligated with BamHI linkers . The insert was released by BamHI digestion and subcloned into M13 mp18 . Termination codons were inserted at specific sites by oligonucleotide - directed mutagenesis ( Amersham version 2 system ) . The cDNA constructs were sequenced to confirm the mutation . The cDNA was cloned into the BamHI site of pet3a , the T7 RNA polymerase - directed expression vector of Studier et al . ( 26 ) . We switched from pLcII to pet vector because the latter gave superior expression . The resultant proteins 14616 Gelsolin / Actin / Polyphosphoinositide - binding Motif 14617 contained a fusion peptide ( MASMTGGQQMGRGSIEGRA ) at their amino terminus . A gelsolin cDNA encoding domains 11 - 111 ( GS150 - 406 ) was generated by restriction enzyme digestion and site - directed mutagenesis . ' Expression and Purification of Truncated Gelsolin - BL21 ( DE3 ) pLysS cells transfected with expression constructs were grown in LB medium containing 100 - 200 pg / ml ampicillin at 37 " C to an AmlOnm of 0 . 6 and induced by 0 . 4 mM isopropyl - 1 - thio - a - galactopyranoside as described previously ( 22 ) . Gelsolin polypeptides were obtained by solubilizing inclusion bodies with 8 M urea ( no detergents ) and purified by sequential anion and cation exchange chromatography ( 22 ) . Protein concentration was determined by the method of Rrad - ford ( 27 ) and protein purity was assessed by electrophoresis on 5 - 20 % acrylamide gradient gels in the presence of SDS . Functional Characterization of Gekolin Polypeptides Actin Monomer Binding - 5 . 1 p ~ pyrene - iodoacetamide - labeled ac - tin ( 28 ) was polymerized for 16 h at room temperature in a solution containing 0 . 15 M KCI , 2 mM MgCl , , 0 . 2 mM CaCI , , 10 mM Tris - HCI , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 5 mM ATP , and 0 . 5 mM d - mercaptoethanol in the presence of increasing amounts of GS149 or GS134 . GS149 prevented actin monomers from polymerizing , resulting in a decrease in pyrene - actin fluorescence intensity , as compared with actin control ( 20 , 22 ) . To study the effect of PIP ? on actin monomer binding , 2 . 4 p ~ GS149 or 2 . 8 p ~ GS1 . 74 was incubated with PIP , before addition of pyrene actin . PIP , ( Sigma ) micelles were prepared by dissolving PIP ? in water to a final concentration of 1 mg / ml and sonicated for 30 sec at maximum power ( model W185 ; Heat Systems Ultrasonics , Inc . , Far - mingdale , NY ) as described ( 14 ) . Gel Filtration Assa - y for PIP , Binding - The assay is similar to that described for studying PIP , binding of profilin ( 11 , 15 ) and CapZ ( 29 ) . It is based on the fact that PIP , micelles are large ( 90 kDa ) , as compared wit . h the gelsolin polypeptides ( 15 and 28 kDa ) , and poly - peptide / PIP , complexes will elute earlier than the unbound polypep - tide . Gelsolin polypeptides were incubated with PIP , micelles for 5 min at room temperature , and 100 pl of the mixture was chromato - graphed at room temperature on a Superose 12 HR 10 / 30 column ( fast protein liquid chromatography system , Pharmacia LKR Bio - technology Inc . ) equilibrated with a buffer containing 5 mM Tris - HCI , pH 7 . 5 , 75 mM KCI , and 0 . 1 mM NaN : , . PIP , was not included in the elution buffer . The elution was at 0 . . 5 ml / min , and 0 . 5 - ml fractions were collected . The elution profile was monitored by ab - sorbance at 280 nm . 300 pl of selected fractions were dried down in a SpeedVac and analyzed by SDS - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis . The amount of protein bound to PIP , was determined from the decrease in the protein absorbance peak , taking into account the contribution of contaminating proteins in the starting material . Rescue of Gelsolin Seuering Actiuity by Competition for PIPp - The basis of this assay was described in detail elsewhere ( 25 ) . Actin filament severing by gelsolin was measured by a fluorescence assay using pyrene - iodoacetamide - labeled actin ( 2 ) . F - actin was diluted to below 0 . 3 pM into solutions containing 0 . 05 pM gelsolin with or without PIP , / PC vesicles . PIP , inhibits actin severing . Proteins / peptides that bind PIP , will compete with gelsolin for PIP , , restoring severing ( 25 ) . Control experiments showed that none of the proteins / peptides severed actin filaments in the absence of gelsolin . Lipid vesicles of approximately 100 - nm diameter containing PIP , and PC at a 1 : 10 molar ratio were formed by sonication as described ( 25 ) . Gelsolin was prepared from human plasma ( 16 ) . Synthetic I ' eptide - P1 , a peptide encompassing GS135 - 149 ( CKSGLKYKKGGVASGF , amino - terminal cysteine added ) was synthesized by standard solid phase methods and purified by CIS high performance liquid chromatography using an acetonitrile gradient in 0 . 150 trifluoroacetic acid . Its concentration was determined by amino acid analysis . Circular Dichroism - CD spectra of GS149 and GS134 in the pres - ence or absence of PIP , micelles were measured using an Aviv model GODS spectrometer at 25 " C in 1 - mm pathlength cells . Spectra were scanned at 1 - nm intervals for 3 sec , and three scans were averaged . The proteins were dialyzed against 5 mM Tris - HCI , pH 7 . 5 , centri - iilged , and filtered before assay . Protein concentrations were deter - mined by amino acid analysis . ' H . Q . Sun , P . A . Janmey , H . L . Yin , manuscript in preparation . RESULTS Gelsolin Domain I Is Inhibited by PIP2 While a Carboxyl - terminal Truncated Mutant Is Not - Fig . 1A shows the SDS - polyacrylamide gel recombinant gelsolin domain I ( GS1 - 149 , referred to as GS149 ; lane 3 ) and a further truncated protein GS134 ( GS1 - 134 ; lane 2 ) . As shown previously ( 18 , 20 , 22 , 23 ) , GS149 inhibited actin polymerization by binding actin monomers stoichiometrically , so maximal inhibition was ob - served at a 1 : 1 mutant / actin molar ratio ( Fig . 1R ) . The presence of a 17 - amino acid fusion peptide at the amino terminus of gelsolin domain I did not interfere with its actin binding activity . GS134 was equally effective , confirming pre - vious reports that gelsolin domain I is functional after trun - cation to residue 126 ( 20 , 23 , 30 ) . Fig . 1C shows that PIP ? inhibited GS149 binding to actin , and half - maximal inhibition of 2 . 4 pM GS149 was observed at 12 pM PIP2 . No inhibition was observed with 100 p ~ phosphatidylcholine or phosphati - dylserine ( data not shown ) , suggesting that the effect of PIP2 was specific , as has been shown previously for gelsolin ( 2 , 14 ) A 1 2 - 3 - 6 . 00 0 . 50 1 00 GSI / Actin PIP2 ( uM ) FIG . 1 .

Lane 1 , standards of 45 , 31 , 21 , and 14 kDa . R , effect of GS149 and GS134 on the extent of actin polymerization . Actin polymerization was determined by the change in fluorescence of pyrene - iodoacetamide - labeled actin . Increasing concentrations of gelsolin polypeptides were added to 5 . 1 pM pyrene actin in a solution containing 0 . 15 M KCI , 2 mM MgCI , , 0 . 2 mM CaCl ? , 10 mM Tris - HCI , pH 7 . 5 , 0 . 5 mM ATP , and 0 . 5 mM b - mercaptoethanol , and the pyrene actin fluorescence was measured after 16 h at room temperature . 0 % inhibition indicated that the final level of fluorescence was identical with that of actin in the absence of gelsolin . The percent inhibition was expressed as a function of the molar ratio of gelsolin polypeptide to actin . Each value was the average of duplicate determinations , and results from several experiments were pooled . C , effect of PIP , on interactions with actin . Increasing concentrations of micellar PIP ? were added to solutions containing 5 . 1 pM pyrene - actin and 2 . 4 pM GS149 or 2 . 8 p ~ GS134 and incubated for 16 h . In the absence of PIP , , ( X149 and GS134 reduced actin polymerization by half . This was defined as 100 % actin binding on the y axis . Polymerization in the presence of PIP ? was expressed as percent of this value . Closed circles , GS149 ; squares , GS134 . 14618 Gelsolin / Actin / Polyphosphoinositide - binding Motif and its homolog , gCap39 ( 4 ) . The dose response is similar to that required for inhibition of severing ( 2 , 21 ) and actin filament side binding ( 21 ) , suggesting that PIP , regulation of gelsolin severing may be mediated through the domain I site as well . In contrast , GS134 was minimally inhibited by 12 p ~ PIP , . Therefore , the deleted residues 135 - 149 ( KSGLKYKKG - GVASGF ) are required for optimal PIP , regulation . Loss of regulation was unlikely to be due to global denaturation , since GS134 inhibited actin polymerization as well as GS149 . This was supported by the finding by others that an even shorter fragment ( GS126 ) binds actin monomer ( 20 , 30 ) . Gel Filtration Analysis of Binding to PIP , - The abilities of GS149 and GS134 to bind PIP , micelles were compared by gel filtration analyses . This method had been used to dem - onstrate high affinity PIP , binding by profilin ( 11 , 15 ) and CapZ ( 29 ) . Fig . 2A , left panel shows that in the absence of PIP2 , GS149 eluted with a V , ( elution volume ) of 13 . 9 ml , and the peak was asymmetric . Addition of PIP2 changed the protein elution profile . At 35 p ~ PIP , , the peak height was reduced , and the original peak was resolved from a slower migrating peak with V , of 14 . 7 ml . At 212 p M PIP2 , the largest peak eluted at V , of 11 . 3 ml , the original V , 13 . 9 ml peak disappeared while the V , 14 . 7 ml peak remained unchanged . SDS - polyacrylamide gel analysis ( Fig . 2B ) shows that after gel filtration , the GS149 fractions contained GS149 and two smaller bands . These bands were most likely GS149 degra - dation products ; freshly prepared GS149 always contained variable amounts of lower molecular weight bands ( Figs . lA and 6A ) , which became more prominent on storage . It is clear from Fig . 2B that PIP , shifted the elution of GS149 but did not alter the elution of the smaller fragments . This suggested that GS149 bound PIP , , whereas the smaller fragments did not . The lack of protein trailing behind the GS149 - micelle complexes was consistent with high PIP , binding affinity , further supporting the conclusion based on efficient inhibition of function by PIP , ( Fig . IC ) . The amount of GS149 bound to PIP , was calculated from the decrease in the original GS149 absorbance peak and plotted against PIP , concentration in Fig . 2C . It increased linearly with PIP , concentration until all of the protein was complexed ( open circle at 140 p ~ PIP , ) . No difference in the binding of 39 and 25 p ~ GS149 was observed , as long as saturation was not reached . The slope of the plot gave a ratio of 1 GS149 to 4 PIP , , which is similar to the binding stoichi - ometry reported for human platelet profilin ( 139 amino acids ; binds 5 PIP , ( 15 ) ) . A similar curve was also obtained with GS150 - 406 , the actin filament side binding domains 11 - 111 of gelsolin ( GS150 - 406 ) . Although this fragment has been pre - viously shown to be inhibited by PPI ( X ) , our result presented here is the first direct measurement of its binding to PIP2 and establishes that the two PPI - binding domains of gelsolin bound PIP , with comparably high affinity . In contrast , no GS134 binding was detected below 53 PM PIPy ( Fig . 2 A ) . At 212 pM PIP , , a faster migrating protein peak ( V , 11 . 3 ml ) appeared , suggesting that some GS134 became associated with PIP , , although to a much lesser extent than GS149 . The GS134 preparation contained a contaminant ( V , of 12 . 6 ml in Fig . 2 A ) , which did not bind PIP , . Fig . 2C shows that 7 PM GS134 bound to 140 p ~ PIP , , whereas equivalent binding of GS149 was observed at 5 times lower PIP2 concentration . Thus , deletion of residues 135 - 149 de - creased PIP , binding affinity and reduced PIP , inhibition of actin binding , establishing that these residues are critically important for the high affinity interaction of gelsolin domain I with PIP , . They are , however , not required for actin mon - K GS134 C 2a 96 o ? / I 0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 PIP2 ( uM ) FIG . 2 .

GS149 and GS134 were incubated with 90 pM PIP , , and 300 pI of each column fraction were dried down in a SpeedVac and analyzed by SDS - PAGE . Although the starting materials were relatively pure ( Fig . L4 and Fig . 6A ) , the column fractions contained more degradation products , probably because they were stored at 4 " C for several days before processing for SDS - PAGE . GS134 was incu - bated with 136 p ~ PIP , , and every other fraction was analyzed by SDS - PAGE .

PIP , Induces a Conformational Change in GS149 but Not GSl34 - Fig . 3 shows the circular dichroism profiles of GS149 in the absence and presence of PIP , . Computer curve fitting indicated that in the absence of PIP , , GS149 contained about 55 % @ - sheets , 35 % random coil , and 10 % a - helix . In the presence of PIP2 , the profile was consistent with 25 % random coil , 65 % @ - sheet , and 10 % a - helix . In contrast , PIP , did not induce significant conformational change in GS134 , confirm - ing that the truncated polypeptide did not bind PIP , . In the absence of PIP , , GS134 had a different conformation than GS149 . Surprisingly , GS134 had a similar @ - sheet and random coil content as GS149 complexed with PIP , .

Nonetheless , since the former binds actin whereas the latter does not , it is not possible to conclude at present that the conformational change in GS149 after PIP , binding ac - counts for inhibition of actin binding . Domain I Synthetic Peptide Interferes with PIP , Binding - We tested the ability of a synthetic peptide ( PI ) containing the deleted sequence to compete with gelsolin polypeptides for PIP2 . Fig . 4A shows that PI inhibited GS149 binding to PIP , micelles in the gel filtration assay . 50 % inhibition of binding was observed at a PI peptide / GS149 molar ratio of 0 . 48 , suggesting that PI bound PIP , with an affinity and stoichiometry comparable with that of the parent GS149 . This was confirmed in a functional assay that is based on the ability of PIP , to prevent gelsolin from severing actin fila - ments and competing peptides to rescue gelsolin from PIP , inhibition ( 14 , 25 ) ( Fig . 4B ) . PI that had no severing activity restored severing by gelsolin in the presence of PIP2 / PC vesicles as effectively as GS149 , suggesting that PI and GS149 100 80 60 40 20 0 0 . 0 1 . o 2 . 0 Peptide / GS149 120 I I [ Peptide ] / [ PIP2 ] FIG . 4 . Synthetic peptide competes with gelsolin for PIP2 . A , PI competes with GS149 binding to PIP , , as determined by gel filtration . Mixtures containing 32 p ~ GS149 and increasing amounts of PI ( a synthetic gelsolin peptide , residues 135 - 149 ) were gel - filtered in the presence of 110 pM micellar PIP , . In the absence of PI , 83 % of total GS149 was complexed with PIP , , and this was defined as 100 % PIP2 binding . The appearance of additional free GS149 in the pres - ence of PI is defined as a decrease in PIP , binding by GS149 . B , PI and GS149 competed with gelsolin for PIP , , restoring actin filament severing by gelsolin . The assay was described in Refs . 14 and 25 . Increasing amounts of PI , P , , GS149 , or pentalysine were mixed with 101 PC / PIP2 vesicles at a concentration of 30 p ~ total PIP , and added to 0 . 05 p ~ gelsolin . The peptide / PIP , ratio was calculated assuming that 50 % of the PIP , was on the external face of the bilayer and therefore accessible to the peptide . Severing activity by gelsolin was measured by following the decrease in pyrene fluorescence after dilution of pyrene F - actin to 0 . 3 p ~ . In the absence of competing peptides , 30 p ~ PIP , inhibited severing by 90 % . None of the compet - ing molecules sever actin filaments . Closed circles , GS149 ; ? pen tri - angles , PI ; closed triangles , p , ; closed squares , lysine pentamers . The latter two curves were taken from Fig . 5 of Ref . 25 . bound PIP , with comparably high affinities . The severing recovery curves for PI and GS149 were similar to that shown previously for a domain I1 amino - terminal peptide P , ( GS150 - 169 , KHVVPNEVVVQRLFQVKGRR ( 25 ) ) , indicating that the newly identified domain I site bound PPI with as high affinity as domain 11 . We have shown previously by dynamic light scattering that P2 did not aggregate the PIP , / PC mixed vesicles , suggesting that it prevented PIP , from inhibiting gelsolin by binding to PIP2 / PC vesicles and not nonspecifi - cally by aggregating them . This was supported by the finding 14620 Gelsolin / Actin / Polyphosphoinositide - binding Motif that pentalysine , which causes aggregation of acidic lipids , was nonetheless much less effective and did not completely restore severing activity even at very high concentrations ( 25 ) . Comparison of PI and P , sequences shows that although they have little overall homology , each has a high concentra - tion of basic residues ( Fig . 5A ) . To determine if all of the basic amino acids in the region defined by PI are important for PPI binding , GS149 mutants in which a single lysine ( K ) was substituted with alanine ( A ) were generated by site - directed mutagenesis . Fig . 6A shows an SDS - polyacrylamide gel of GS149 and two mutants , GS149 ( A " " ) ( the mutated residue is designated in parentheses ) and GS149 ( A ' " ? . The mutants inhibited actin polymerization and were regulated by PIP , to a similar extent as the wild type GS149 ( Fig . 6B ) . Therefore , the replacement of a single lysine with alanine had little effect on the ability of this domain to bind actin or PIP , . That these mutants bound PIP , was confirmed by gel filtra - tion ( data not shown ) . DISCUSSION In this paper , we identified a new polyphosphoinositide - binding site on gelsolin . We showed that gelsolin domain I ( residues 1 - 149 ) bound PIP , and its interaction with actin was inhibited by PIP , at molar ratios similar to that required to inhibit actin filament severing by gelsolin . Circular dichro - ism studies showed that PIP , binding reduced the random coil content of gelsolin domain I and increased the proportion of @ - sheet . Carboxyl - terminal truncation studies showed that residues 135 - 149 were important for GS149 interaction with PIP , because GS134 that is missing this sequence was no longer PIP , - sensitive and did not bind PIP , .

A , the structure of the gelsolin amino - terminal half ( human plasma gelsolin residues 1 - 406 ) , which contains three semiconserved repeating domains . It severs actin filaments , and sev - ering requires the cooperative interaction between an actin filament side binding site ( located in GSII - 111 ) and another actin monomer binding site located in GSI . In this paper , we demonstrated that Pi , which is at the carhoxyl terminus of GSI , bound PIP2 . The contiguous sequence P2 also hound PIP2 ( 25 ) , suggesting that gelsolin has at least two PIP2 - binding sites .

GS149 to PIP , and prevented PIP , from inhibiting actin filament severing by gelsolin more effectively than pentaly - sine . These results strongly suggest that PI contains the PIP , - binding site of GS149 . Gelsolin domain I contains an actin - binding site that is necessary for severing actin - actin bonds after gelsolin at - taches laterally to actin filaments via domains 11 - 111 . The interactions of domain I with actin have been characterized extensively , and residues important for actin binding have been identified by deletional and site - directed mutagenesis ( 17 - 20 , 22 , 23 , 30 - 32 ) . This is , however , the first report that actin binding by domain I is regulated by PPI . Our results show that domain I bound PPI as well as domains 11 - 111 , which we have previously shown to be inhibited by PIP , ( 21 ) . Therefore , it is likely that PPI inhibit both actin - binding steps in the severing process . The existence of multiple PPI - binding sites , as well as multiple actin - binding sites in gelso - lin , may explain why severing is particularly sensitive to PPI inhibition . It may also explain why actin filament end - capping and nucleation by gelsolin , which require only one of the two amino - terminal PPI - regulated domains , are also inhibited by PPI but to a lesser extent ( 2 ) . The region important for PPI binding in domain I was located to within the carboxyl - terminal 15 residues of domain I . Deletion of this sequence resulted in a substantial loss of PPI binding and regulation of actin binding , whereas a syn - thetic peptide containing this sequence competed effectively with domain I and gelsolin for PIP , . The PPI - binding site is distinct from the actin - binding site , because the carboxyl - Gelsolin / Actin / Polyphosphoinositide - binding Motif 14621 terminal - truncated domain I polypeptide bound actin as well as full - length domain I . Likewise , we showed recently that a synthetic peptide ( P2 ) from the amino - terminus of domain I1 ( GS150 - 169 ) competed effectively with gelsolin polypeptides for PIP2 , suggesting that it also contains a PPI - binding site ( 25 ) . This sequence is contiguous with the putative domain I PPI - binding site identified here . Secondary structure analyses according to Chou - Fasman and Gamier - Osguthorpe - Robson routines ( MAX - VECTOR program ) predict that the sequence spanning PI and P2 contains mostly random coils , which will allow the basic residues in this region to have the flexibility to conform to the acidic head groups in a PPI cluster . PPI binding may induce a conformational change in the PPI - binding domain and in the rest of the molecule as well to inhibit actin binding and severing . Circular dichroism studies with GS149 suggest that the conformation change in domain I involves a transition from random coil to P - sheet . In addi - tion , there is preliminary evidence that Pz , which has a random coil conformation in solution , adopts a predominantly a - helical conformation on binding to PIP2 ( 33 ) . Inhibition of actin binding may result from an induced change in the conformation of the actin - binding sites or indirectly through changes in other parts of the molecule to limit access to actin and / or cooperative interactions between different actin - bind - ing domains . Each of the putative PPI - binding sites on gelsolin contains a stretch of basic residues spaced almost identically : KXXXKXKK in PI and KXXXXKXRR in Pz ( Fig . 5B ) . Site - directed mutagenesis studies of gelsolin domain I showed that replacement of 2 of the lysines individually with alanine did not affect PPI binding , suggesting that these lysines are not essential for interaction with PPI , providing that the other residues are still present . This is not surprising because PPI binding is likely to be mediated by multiple charge - charge interactions as well as hydrogen bonding ( 14 ) , so neutraliza - tion of a single charge may not significantly affect binding . Additional experiments will be required to determine the effects of replacing other lysines singly and in combination and of deleting the Pz sequence in domain I1 to assess its importance for PPI binding directly . Furthermore , although our results suggest that the region spanning domains I and I1 is important for PPI regulation , it does not rule out that other sites on gelsolin may also be involved . These sites may account for the residual PPI binding and regulation of GS134 . Although we have not yet identified the residues in the PI and P2 motifs that are required for high affinity PPI binding , it is interesting to note that this motif is found in two other members of the gelsolin family , villin ( 34 ) and gCap39 ( 4 ) , and a number of unrelated PPI - regulated actin - binding pro - teins ( Fig . 5 , B and C ) . Among the gelsolin family , gelsolin is the only member with two putative PIPz - binding sites , whereas villin and gCap39 have one in their domains 11 . Severin does not have the spacing of the basic motif even though it is inhibited by PIPz ( 3 ) . It will be important to compare the PPI binding affinity and specificity of the gel - solin family of proteins to sort out the functional significance of having a different number of negatively charged residues and different primary structures for the binding sites . There are indications that villin is less sensitive to PPI than gelsolin ( 8 ) . Subtle differences in PPI regulation among these proteins would not be surprising , since considerable differences in their Ca2 + regulation have already been demonstrated ( 4 , 8 , 22 ) . Human profilin ( 35 ) has a modified motif , with a 6 - amino acid spacing between the first 2 basic residues and substitution of Lys with His . Since His is partly charged at neutral pH , human profilin may have lower PIPz binding affinity than gelsolin . Acanthamoeba profilin 11 , which binds PIP2 but with at least 10 - fold lower affinity than human profilin ( 15 ) , does not have the putative motif ( 35 ) . Cofilin has a similar motif in residues 13 - 22 . Although an unrelated peptide derived from cofilin 104 - 115 was recently shown to bind PPI and actin ( 36 ) , it remains possible that cofilin residues 13 - 22 contain another PPI - binding site . The PIPz - binding motif is not restricted to actin regulatory proteins . Several inositol - spe - cific phospholipase C isozymes ( 26 ) have a similar motif ( Fig . 5C ) at the extreme carboxyl terminus of a conserved domain , referred to as the " X box " ( 37 ) . The existence of a common motif among a large variety of PPI - binding proteins is con - sistent with its importance for high affinity polyphosphoino - sitide - specific binding . REFERENCES 2 .
