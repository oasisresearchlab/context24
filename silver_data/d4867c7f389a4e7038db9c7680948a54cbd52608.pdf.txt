1 SARS - COV - 2 TRANSMISSION IN PRIMARY SCHOOL CHILDREN RAG 10 / 11 / 2020 – validated by RMG 12 / 11 / 2020 QUESTION As widespread community transmission is occurring again throughout Europe and especially in Belgium , non - pharmaceutical interventions are reinforced . However , certain measures might be impossible for children to follow or even unnecessary and harmful . Not only does the role of children < 12y in transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 remain currently unclear , their developmental and psychological needs are different from those of adults . Finally , COVID - 19 disease in children is generally accepted to be a predominantly mild disease , hence concerns are more about their role in fueling community transmission than about their individual safety , which means a careful harm / benefit evaluation should be made . Currently , exceptions are made for children < 12y regarding social distancing rules , gatherings , definition of ‘close contact’ and mask - wearing in schools . Now , 2 months after reopening of schools , amidst dramatically high incidence rates in the Belgian population and with more and more emphasis being placed on the possibility of airborne transmission , the RAG is asked to evaluate whether children in primary school should wear a face mask , as has been recommended in some other countries . Additionally , the question is asked whether the definition of high - risk contact in children in primary school should be the same as for children in secondary school . CONTENTS 1 .

Recommendation  The RAG does NOT recommend the use of face masks for children in primary school .  The risk of transmission needs to be reduced by taking other risk - reducing measures . These have been previously defined in the protocols with color coding . The color code that is used should adequately reflect the level of transmission in the community . Hence in case of intense virus circulation in the community , schools should switch to code red , regardless of the situation within the school walls .  Priority is given to compulsory education . Extracurricular activities ( youth movements , sports , art academies , hobbies… ) should comply with rules that are at least as strict as the rules at school . This is important to limit potential transmission of the virus but also to avoid confusion and poor compliance with the rules .  In code red , teachers in primary schools should wear face masks , even when keeping 1 , 5m distance . Masks should cover mouth and nose and fit closely at the sides . Masks with a transparent part can be used to allow students to still see the lips of the teacher , which is especially important when learning to read or learning a new language , but face shields should NOT be used .  As already defined in the current protocols , teachers in primary school should wear a mask when unable to keep distance from other adults and when in closed shared spaces . ‘Mask - breaks’ can be taken outdoors when keeping a distance of min . 1 , 5m , indoors in a private space or indoors when working quietly in a well - ventilated space and keeping a distance of min . 1 , 5m .  The current definition of high - risk contact in children is maintained . o This means all children of the same class group are considered low - risk contacts if a child is the index case in primary school . Low - risk contacts can continue to go to school but should limit their contacts . This means extracurricular activities ( sports , hobbies , art academy… ) are not allowed for 14 days after the last low - risk contact . Priority is given to compulsory education since it is both important for the development of the child and allows parents to continue their own activities . Children who have been identified as either high or low risk contacts should not be looked after by the grandparents . o If case the index case is an adult ( teacher or other ) children are considered low - risk contacts , unless there was a continuous exposure of > 15 minutes at < 1 , 5m ( which should be avoided ) . An exposure of > 15’ at < 1 , 5m is considered a high - risk contact even if the teacher was wearing a face mask . o In case there is suspicion of a cluster , stricter measures can be taken . 3 2 . Elements of discussion  The detrimental effects of prolonged school closures on children’s wellbeing , social and intellectual development and potential long - term consequences have been clearly shown . It is therefore of paramount importance to keep schools open , including when high levels of virus circulation warrant strong mitigation measures in the rest of society .  As the risk of school outbreaks is linked to the level of community transmission , more emphasis should be placed on risk - reducing behavior / measures in the general population .  Compulsory mask - wearing for students and staff alike might theoretically contribute to the possibility of keeping schools open in a safe way .  Other countries have taken a more strict approach on wearing of masks in children , seemingly without difficulties , although benefit is equally unclear .  We need to be prepared for an increase in case numbers again , especially since there exists a risk of re - introduction of the virus from abroad .  The reduction in case numbers started before the effect of the school holidays could be seen .  Other risk - reducing measures ( e . g . smaller , fixed groups , social distancing , ventilation ) should be envisaged first . Color codes had been defined for this , but have been poorly used .  Once masks have been imposed , parents and teachers might be anxious if the obligation would later on be relaxed again ( e . g . at lower levels of virus circulation ) .  Being less able to see facial expressions of fellow pupils and teachers might adversely affect pupil’s wellbeing and motivation to learn .  Children with learning difficulties or for which the teaching language is not their first language might be disproportionally affected by mask wearing as it reduces interpretation of facial expression . 3 . Belgian test data on infections in children 3 . 1 . OVERALL CASE NUMBERS Figure 1 shows the relative contributions of children in the different age groups to the total number of Belgian cases since the summer holidays . Children in primary school age make up 3 , 9 % of all positive cases since September 1 st versus 8 , 1 % for children in secondary school age . Figure 1 : Number of confirmed cases over time since start of the summer , by age group . 4 3 . 2 . TEST - POSITIVITY RATES Differences in test - strategies ( e . g . less testing in children , since they present more often with no or mild symptoms , less testing high - risk contacts ) have often been cited as reason for the lower number of cases in children . However , not only the total case numbers are lower in the younger age groups , also the test - positivity rate is lower in the youngest age group ( Figure 2 ) . Fig . 2 : Evolution of test - positivity rate by age group , from beginning of summer Figure 3 : total number of positive and negative tests and test - positivity rate in children of primary school age ( 6 - 12 years ) and secondary school age ( 13 - 18 years ) , since start summer holidays .

Data from contact tracing in schools ( preliminary data ) 4 . 1 . FOR FRENCH - SPEAKING EDUCATION ( DATA COLLECTED BY ONE ) Analyses are based on data from French - speaking education from September 1 st until 18 - 10 - 2020 ( change in test - strategy on 21 / 10 , school holidays starting 2 / 11 ) . More analyses are ongoing . Despite roughly equal numbers of pupils in primary and secondary education , case numbers are much lower in primary school than in secondary school , especially when comparing with second and third grade . Cases in staff also represent an important part of all cases that were notified in schools . Figure 5 : Number of cases reported in schools in FWB by level of education of case and week Note : - not all possible cases are tested in children 0 - 5y - a stricter definition of close contacts is applied in children < 12y 6 On 25 / 10 / 2020 , the cumulative incidence over the past 14 days in the data collected by ONE was 647 / 100 , 000 students in primary school and 1 , 838 / 100 , 000 students in secondary school . At that time , the 14d cumulative incidence for the general population was 1 , 770 / 100 , 000 for Wallonia and Brussel . The majority of index cases in primary school ( 61 % ) is tested because of a high - risk exposure outside of school . In secondary schools , 54 % of index cases ( defined as the first unrelated case in a school group ) are identified because of symptoms compatible with COVID - 19 , as opposed to 33 % in children in primary school and 68 % in staff . Secondary cases are defined as two cases for which transmission likely occurred at school . These data need to be interpreted with caution , as it is not always clear where transmission occurred , especially at the end of October when case numbers both at school and in the broader society were very high . Whilst absolute case numbers are lower in primary schools , the proportion of cases that is a secondary case ( defined as a case where transmission most likely occurred within the school context ) is comparable between staff , pupils in primary and pupils in secondary school ( Figure 6 ) . Figure 6 : number and proportion of total infections that are secondary infections , by age group 7 4 . 2 . FOR FLEMISH EDUCATION ( DATA COLLECTED BY CLB ) Analyses are based on data from September 1 st – October 25 th . More analyses are ongoing . Similar to the total number of cases in Flanders compared to Wallonia / Brussels , cases in Flemish schools rose less steeply and slightly later than in French - speaking education , but we observe the same trend of significantly higher case numbers in the older age groups . Figure 7 : number of cases reported in Flemish schools , per age group and week Data on secondary cases is missing for 42 % of total cases , which importantly limits the interpretation of the numbers . For those with available data , for only 6 % ( 270 / 4733 cases ) of total index cases at least one secondary case was reported , across all age groups . For only 3 . 2 % of index cases in primary school at least one onwards infection is reported , versus 6 . 9 % of index cases in secondary school . We need however to bear in mind that rules regarding ( testing of ) high - risk contacts are different in these two groups ( Table 1 ) .

International Scientific literature An excellent rapid review of the topic “What is the specific role of daycares and schools in COVID - 19 transmission ? ” was performed by the Canadian Collaborative Centre for Methods and Tools and updated 22th of October ( 1 ) . They conclude : 5 . 1 . SUSCEPTIBILITY OF CHILDREN TO SARS - COV - 2 Global case numbers in children are low . According to data from the ECDC , on 5 / 11 / 2020 children between 5 - 14 year represented only 4 , 4 % of all confirmed infections with SARS - CoV - 2 in the EU / UK and almost all were mild cases . In the US , children ( according to state defined as < 17 - 19y ) make up 23 % of the population but currently represent only 11 , 1 % of all confirmed infections ( 2 ) . In countries where widespread community testing ( either PCR or serology ) has been implemented , children were less likely to test positive than adults ( 3 – 7 ) . However , these results might be biased if children had less exposure to the virus , e . g . because school closures were in place . Yet , even after a known exposure , data from contact tracing studies indicates that children are less likely to get infected than adults after exposure within the household ( 8 – 12 ) . Mathematical modelling concluded that children are about half as likely to get infected as adults ( 8 ) , a conclusion that was supported by a meta - analysis of contact tracing data by Viner et al ( 12 ) . Another more recent meta - analysis by Koh et al . pooled data from 14 contact tracing studies and , likewise , found adults more likely to become infected after exposure within the household than children ( < 18y ) , with a RR of 1 , 71 [ 1 . 35 - 2 . 17 ] , although there was considerable heterogeneity among the included studies . These effects seem greater for younger children ( either < 5y or < 10y ) compared to older children ( 13 ) . Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this relative resistance , from immune imprinting by other viruses ( 14 ) to distribution , maturation , and functioning of viral receptors ( 15 ) . Based on the published reports to date from both prior to COVID - 19 lockdown and following re - opening , the risk of transmission from children to children and children to adults in primary school and daycare settings appears low , particularly when infection control measures are in place . The certainty of the evidence is low ( GRADE ) , and findings may change as new data become available . 9 Source : Koh et al . ( 16 ) Upper part : adults , lower part : children 5 . 2 . ONWARDS TRANSMISSION FROM CHILDREN Transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 from children , even neonates , is plausible as shown by successful viral cultures of SARS - CoV - 2 from approximately half of twenty - three RT - PCR positive symptomatic children ( 17 ) . In addition , a study of 3 , 712 COVID - 19 patients by the group of Christian Drosten in Germany reported viral loads ( estimated by real - time RT - PCR threshold cycle values ) to be similar in children and adults ( 18 ) . A smaller study from the US in 49 hospitalized children did not detect any differences in viral load according to age group ( 19 ) whereas a research letter analyzing a total of 145 SARS - CoV - 2 patients with mild to moderate symptoms , found a higher viral load ( lower CT - values ) in children < 5 years old compared to older children and adults ( 20 ) . However , the real - life significance of these findings is unknown . In a literature review including 31 articles on household transmission , children were found to be the index case for household clusters in only 10 % ( 21 ) . Most of these studies were from Asia , but a Swiss study found similar results ( 8 % children as index cases in the household ) ( 22 ) . Again , these data need to be interpreted with caution , as the likelihood of exposure for children ( and hence introducing the virus into the household ) might be different than for adults when strict lockdown measures are in place ( 23 ) . In contrast , a more recent study from the US showed a higher potential for onwards transmission for younger children . Among 14 households where the index case was < 18 years old , secondary infection rate was 53 % [ 31 - 74 ] for children < 12 years as opposed to 38 % [ 23 - 56 % ] for children between 12 - 17 years old ( 24 ) . A frequent concern is that symptoms in children are often absent or go unnoticed so they can unknowingly contribute to further spread . However , a distinction should be made between pre - symptomatic transmission ( before the onset of symptoms ) and transmission from truly asymptomatic individuals . Two large meta - analyses found that truly asymptomatic cases were three times less likely 10 to transmit the virus to their household contacts than symptomatic cases ( 16 , 25 ) . A study from South Korea including 91 children found 22 % of SARS - CoV - 2 + children to remain asymptomatic throughout the course of the disease ( 26 ) , which seems no different than the overall estimate of 20 - 30 % truly asymptomatic cases ( regardless of age ) which was found by Buitrago et al . in a meta - analysis including 94 studies ( 25 ) . It seems however important to pay close attention to possible symptoms in children , as in the South Korean data symptoms were not noticed before diagnosis for 70 % of children , despite the children being quarantined after high - risk contact or travel from abroad ( 26 ) . Onwards transmission from children ( < 12y ) in daycare towards their parents was shown in Utah . In three day care centres , the virus was introduced by a staff member and passed on to a total of 12 children ( 1 child age 10 months , 11 others 6 - 10y old ) . In turn , these children transmitted the virus further to 12 / 46 non - facility contacts ( 27 ) . An outbreak in a nursery was also reported from Poland , where the virus was introduced by an infected worker and several co - workers , children and parents of children became infected ( 28 ) . Reassuringly though , a large study from the US looked at the risk of COVID - 19 infection and being a child care provider ( for children < 6y old ) . Data was gathered on a total of 57 , 335 child care providers , of which 427 were reported COVID - 19 cases . After correcting for background transmission rates and other demographic variables and potential confounders , no association was found between exposure to child care and COVID - 19 infection ( 29 ) . Of note is that most child care programs did have risk - reduction strategies in place like smaller groups and frequent handwashing and disinfection , but only 35 % of staff was required to wear a mask and only 11 % of facilities required mask wearing in children > 2y old . For children in primary school age , Fontanet and colleagues studied the seroprevalence of students and their household members in the region of Oise , where SARS - CoV - 2 was introduced early on in the epidemic , before school closures . Although the attack rate in primary school children was relatively low and the retrospective design makes it impossible to establish with certainty who infected who in the household , children did seem to be able to pass on the infection to their household members : the infection attack rate was 61 % in parents of infected pupils as compared to 6 . 9 % in parents of non - infected pupils ( 30 ) . Child - to - adult transmission within households cannot be compared to child - to - adult transmission within schools , as is shown by data from Sweden . Primary schools in Sweden remained open , but infection amongst teachers was not higher than in other professions ( 31 ) . Finally , during a large outbreak in a secondary school in Israel , 153 infected students and 25 infected staff members passed on the infection to relatives and friends , to amount to a total of 260 infected individuals ( including staff and students ) linked to the outbreak ( 32 ) . 5 . 3 . TRANSMISSION IN SCHOOL SETTINGS / YOUTH GATHERINGS Contact tracing and cluster investigations in schools before lockdown done in Ireland ( 33 ) , France ( 34 ) and New South Wales ( 35 ) reported very limited onwards transmission . A comparison between Finland , where primary schools closed , and Sweden , where primary schools remained open , did not show any measurable impact of the school closure on the number of laboratory - confirmed cases in children ( 31 ) . Beginning of August , ECDC published a risk assessment on COVID - 19 in children and the role of school settings in COVID - 19 transmission and concluded that “Investigations of cases identified in school settings suggest that child to child transmission in schools is uncommon and not the primary cause of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in children whose onset of infection coincides with the period during which they are attending school , particularly in preschools and primary schools . ” ( 36 ) Secondary schools seem at higher risk for outbreaks than primary schools : despite introduction of the virus in both a high school and a primary school in the French region of Oise , the infection attack rate was estimated at 8 . 8 % in primary school students compared to 38 . 3 % in the high school students ( 30 , 37 ) . That high schools present a higher risk of transmission is supported by the report of a large outbreak in a high school in Israel ( 32 ) . In the school in Israel , several risk factors for transmission were reported : classes were crowded ( 35 – 38 students per class ) , distancing among students and between 11 students and teachers was not possible , an exemption of mask use was made during the heat wave and there was continuous use of air - conditioning . Cluster investigations in Germany showed that school outbreaks occurred in primary as well as secondary schools , despite low incidence . They found some evidence that transmission did occur within a school and case numbers were higher in older age groups ( 38 ) . This is in line with findings from the UK , where 30 school outbreaks before the summer holidays were analyzed ( 39 ) . The authors conclude that “overall , infections and outbreaks were uncommon across all educational settings . ” The majority of outbreaks was linked to staff ( staff - to - staff n = 15 , staff - to - student n = 7 vs . student - to - staff n = 6 and student - to - student n = 2 ) . The risk of outbreaks was linked to the level of community transmission and outbreaks were more common in secondary schools . Finally , Macartney and colleagues reported data from Australian educational settings where 25 schools / facilities had children ( n = 12 ) or adults ( n = 15 ) attend while infectious , with 1448 contacts monitored . Secondary transmission occurred in only four settings , but one outbreak involved transmission to six adults and seven children . Risk of transmission was much higher when a member of staff was the index case ( SAR 15 / 669 = 2 % ) than when a child was the index case ( SAR 3 / 752 = 0 . 4 % ) . Moreover , despite only 10 % of the school attendees being staff , primary COVID - cases were staff members in 56 % of educational settings ( 40 ) . Source : Kampe et al ( 38 ) Risk of transmission seems also dependent on the setting and can be ( much ) higher during youth gatherings / overnight camps . During an overnight youth camp in Georgia with 590 young participants ( aged 6 to 21 years ) and 7 staff members ( 22 + ) , high attack rates were noted in all age groups , including those 6 to 10 years old , after a teenage staff member was confirmed with COVID - 19 during the camp . Out of 344 people tested , 76 % had a positive result . Of note is that there were indoor activities organized without extra ventilation of the rooms , there was a lot of loud singing , shouting and 12 cheering and given the increasing incidence of COVID - 19 in Georgia in June and July , some cases might have resulted from transmission occurring before or after camp attendance ( 29 ) . 5 . 4 . EFFECTIVENESS OF MASK USE IN CHILDREN The effectiveness of mask use is generally accepted for adults . Younger children might however not be able to correctly use the mask . The WHO recommendation on use of masks in children ( 41 ) discusses the ( limited ) available evidence of use of masks in children : “ Evidence on the benefits and harms of children wearing masks to mitigate transmission of COVID - 19 and other coronaviruses is limited . However , some studies have evaluated the effectiveness of mask use in children for influenza and other respiratory viruses 30 - 34 . A study of mask wearing during seasonal influenza outbreaks in Japan noted that the use of masks was more effective in higher school grades ( 9 - 12 year old children in grades 4 - 6 ) than lower grades ( 6 - 9 year old children , in grades 1 - 3 ) 34 . One study , conducted under laboratory conditions and using non - betacoronaviruses , suggested that children between five and 11 years old were significantly less protected by mask wearing compared to adults , possibly related to inferior fit of the mask 35 . Other studies found evidence of some protective effect for influenza for both source control 30 and protection in children 34 , although overall compliance with consistent mask wearing , especially among children under the age of 15 , was poor . Some studies , including studies conducted in the context of influenza and air pollution , found the use and acceptability of mask wearing to be highly variable among children , ranging from very low to acceptable levels and decreasing over time while wearing masks 30 , 31 , 33 , 36 - 38 . One study was carried out among primary school children during COVID - 19 and reported 51 . 6 % compliance 31 . Several studies found that factors such as warmth , irritation , breathing difficulties , discomfort , distraction , low social acceptability and poor mask fit were reported by children when using masks 30 , 33 , 36 , 37 . So far , the effectiveness and impact of masks for children during play and physical activity have not been studied ; however , a study in adults found that N95 respirator and surgical masks reduced cardiopulmonary capacity during heavy exertion 39 . ” 13 6 . International recommendations on masks in children 6 . 1 . WHO ( 41 ) WHO and UNICEF advise that the decision to use masks for children aged 6 - 11 should be based on a risk - based approach . This approach should take into consideration :  intensity of transmission in the area where the child is and updated data / available evidence on the risk of infection and transmission in this age group ;  social and cultural environment such as beliefs , customs , behaviour or social norms that influence the community and population’s social interactions , especially with and among children ;  the child’s capacity to comply with the appropriate use of masks and availability of appropriate adult supervision ;  potential impact of mask wearing on learning and psychosocial development ; and  additional specific considerations and adaptions for specific settings such as households with elderly relatives , schools , during sport activities or for children with disabilities or with underlying diseases . 6 . 2 . ECDC “Within the community the use of face masks is recommended in indoor settings when it is not possible to maintain physical distancing . However , in school settings , implementing this measure is challenging , as it is known that children have a lower tolerance to wearing masks for extended periods of time , and may fail to use the masks properly . In primary schools , the use of face masks is recommended for teachers and other adults when physical distancing cannot be guaranteed , although it is not recommended for the students . In secondary schools , the use of face masks is recommended for both students and adults . The use of masks should be seen as a complementary measure , rather than a single measure to prevent transmission within schools . Physical distancing , safe coughing etiquette , hand hygiene , and staying at home when ill are all still important measures for reducing infection , irrespective of whether masks are being used within schools . ” 6 . 3 . CDC Appropriate and consistent use of masks may be challenging for some students , teachers , and staff , including :  Younger students , such as those in early elementary schoo  Students , teachers , and staff with severe asthma or other breathing difficulties 14 6 . 4 .
