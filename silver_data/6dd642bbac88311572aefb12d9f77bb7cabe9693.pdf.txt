Although regulation of phosphatidylinositol ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) - trisphosphate 25 [ PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ] signaling via PTEN has been well established in model organisms and mammals , 26 it remains elusive in the parasitic protist E . histolytica , which heavily relies on PtdIns phosphate ( s ) - 27 dependent membrane traffic , migration , and phago - and trogocytosis for its pathogenesis . In this 28 study , we characterized the major PTEN from E . histolytica , EhPTEN1 , which shows the highest 29 expression at the transcript level in the trophozoite stage among 6 possible PTENs , to understand 30 the significance of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 signaling in this parasite . Live imaging of GFP - EhPTEN1 31 expressing amebic trophozoites showed localization mainly in the cytosol with a higher 32 concentration at pseudopods and the extending edge of the phago - and trogocytic cups . 33 Furthermore , quantitative analysis of phago - and trogocytosis using a confocal image cytometer 34 showed that overexpression of EhPTEN1 caused reduction in trogo - and phagocytosis while 35 transcriptional gene silencing of EhPTEN1 gene caused opposite phenotypes . These data suggest 36 that EhPTEN1 has an inhibitory role in these biological processes . Conversely , EhPTEN1 acts as 37 a positive regulator for fluid - phase and receptor - mediated endocytosis in E . histolytica 38 trophozoites . Moreover , we showed that EhPTEN1 was required for optimal growth and migration 39 of this parasite . Finally , the phosphatase activity of EhPTEN1 towards PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 was 40 demonstrated , suggesting that the biological roles of EhPTEN1 are likely linked to its catalytic 41 function . Taken together , these results indicate that EhPTEN1 differentially regulates multiple 42 cellular activities essential for proliferation and pathogenesis of the organism , via PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 43 signaling . Elucidation of biological roles of PTEN and PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 signaling at the molecular 44 3 levels promotes our understanding of the pathogenesis of this parasite and potentially leads to the 45 design of novel therapeutics against amebiasis . 46 47 Author summary 48 Entamoeba histolytica is an intestinal protozoan parasite that causes amoebic dysentery and liver 49 abscesses in humans . It has been well understood how the amoeba ' s ability to ingests and destroy 50 human cells and invade tissues contributes to disease symptoms such as bloody diarrhea . The 51 underlying mechanisms for such activities , called pathogenicity , include trafficking ( transport ) and 52 secretion of cytolytic proteins , migration ( ameboid movement ) , and ingestion and destruction of 53 human cells , heavily rely on the signal transduction system via metabolism ( synthesis and 54 decomposition ) of phosphoinositides ( phosphatidylinositols containing 0 - 5 phosphates ) , and 55 downstream regulation of cytoskeleton ( dynamic network of interlinking protein filaments , such 56 as actin , in the cytoplasm ) . In this study , we characterized one enzyme called EhPTEN1 , which 57 degrades and inactivate PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . We have shown that EhPTEN1 is involved in migration , 58 internalization of soluble and solid materials ( endocytosis , trogo - , and phagocytosis ) . EhPTEN1 59 apparently regulates cell migration , endocytosis , trogo - , phagocytosis , and proliferation in a 60 complex fashion . Our findings help in the elucidation of the physiological significance of PTEN 61 and cellular events regulated via phosphoinositides in this enteric parasite and other pathogenic 62 parasites , and potentially lead to the development of new control measures against parasitic 63 diseases . 64 65 Introduction 66 4 Phosphatidylinositol phosphates ( PIPs ) are membrane phospholipids that play pivotal roles in a 67 variety of biological processes such as cytoskeletal reorganization , vesicular trafficking , 68 endocytosis , signal transduction , ion channel activation , and cell migration [ 1 , 2 ] . There are seven 69 different species of PIPs in mammalian cells including three phosphatidylinositol monophosphate , 70 three phosphatidylinositol biphosphate , and one phosphatidylinositol triphosphate [ 2 ] . PIPs 71 kinases and phosphatases regulate the cellular function of PIPs through reversible phosphorylation 72 and de - phosphorylation [ 3 ] . PTEN ( phosphatase and tensin homologue ) is a lipid phosphatase that 73 dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) - trisphosphate [ PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ] to 74 phosphatidylinositol ( 4 , 5 ) - bisphosphate [ PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] , thus depleting cellular signaling 75 processes downstream of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 [ 4 ] . PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 acts as a secondary messenger which 76 activates the proto - oncogenic PI3K – AKT signaling pathway [ 5 ] . PTEN plays a crucial role in cell 77 proliferation through its cytoplasmic phosphatase activity against the PI3K – AKT cascade [ 6 ] . Also , 78 PTEN regulates cell polarity and migration via the establishment of a PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - 79 PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 gradient [ 7 , 8 ] . Many human cancers are associated to PTEN mutations , including 80 endometrial tumors , glioblastoma , prostate carcinoma , melanoma , and hereditary cancer 81 predisposition syndromes , such as Cowden disease [ 9 , 10 ] . Furthermore , PTEN can modulate 82 immune responses by regulating Fc  receptor - mediated phagocytosis [ 11 , 12 ] . 83 Human amebiasis is caused by the infection of the enteric protozoan parasite Entamoeba 84 histolytica . World Health Organization estimates 50 million people throughout the world suffers 85 from amebic infections , resulting in around 100 , 000 deaths annually [ 13 ] . Infection by E . 86 histolytica usually occurs via ingestion of fecally contaminated food or water with the infective 87 cyst of this parasite [ 14 ] . Destruction of intestinal epithelial tissue by amoebic trophozoites causes 88 colitis and amoebic dysentery while in some patients trophozoites can infect extraintestinal organs 89 5 where they form abscesses [ 15 ] . It is known that the virulence mechanisms of E . histolytica are 90 sustained by actin - associated processes such as migration , adhesion , and trogo - / phagocytosis as 91 well as vesicular traffic involved in the secretion of proteases [ 16 - 19 ] . A sufficient set of PI - kinases 92 and phosphatases to generate 7 species of phosphoinositides appear to be conserved in E . 93 histolytica [ 20 ] . AGC kinases have recently been identified as PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ‐binding proteins 94 and shown to be involved in trogocytosis and phagocytosis in E . histolytica [ 21 ] . Physiological 95 significance of PtdIns ( 3 ) P - and PtdIns ( 4 ) P - binding proteins including FYVE domain - containing 96 proteins was shown [ 22 ] . In addition , the distinct roles of PtdIns ( 3 ) P - binding sorting nexins 97 ( SNXs ) in trogocytosis have been demonstrated in E . histolytica [ 23 ] . Among them , 98 PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 - mediated signaling is assumed to have a pivotal role in E . histolytica virulence . 99 Although physiological roles of PTEN have been well established in higher eukaryotes , the role 100 of PTEN in E . histolytica in pathogenesis remains elusive . 101 In the present study , we characterized the biological roles of EhPTEN1 , which shows the 102 highest expression at the transcript level in the trophozoite stage among six putative PTENs 103 encoded by the genome . We have shown that EhPTEN1 is enzymatically active against 104 PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and is required for optimal growth of E . histolytica cells . We have also found that 105 EhPTEN1 is involved in the regulation of different modes of endocytosis , namely fluid - phase 106 endocytosis , receptor - mediated endocytosis , phago - , trogocytosis , and cell migration . 107 108 Results 109 Identification and features of PTEN genes in E . histolytica 110 A genome - wide survey of PTEN in the genome of E . histolytica HM - 1 : IMSS reference strain 111 ( AmoebaDB , http : / / amoebadb . org ) by BLASTP analysis using human PTEN ( P60484 ) as a query , 112 6 revealed that E . histolytica possesses 6 possible PTEN or PTEN - like proteins that contain PTEN 113 phosphatase domain , and show different domain configurations ( Fig 1A ) [ 20 ] . We tentatively 114 designated them firstly in an ascending order of the number of recognizable domains and secondly 115 in a descending order of the overall length ( EhPTEN1 , EHI _ 197010 ; EhPTEN2 , EHI _ 098450 ; 116 EhPTEN3 , EHI _ 131070 ; EhPTEN4 , EHI _ 054460 ; EhPTEN5 , EHI _ 041900 ; EhPTEN6 , 117 EHI _ 010360 ) . Our previous transcriptome data [ 24 - 26 ] verified that one protein ( EhPTEN1 , 118 EHI _ 197010 ) is highly expressed in the trophozoite stage in both E . histolytica HM - 1 : IMSS cl6 119 and G3 strains , while the 5 other PTENs are expressed at relatively low levels ( Fig 1B ) . EhPTEN1 120 shows 39 % mutual identity to human PTEN at the amino acid level ( S1 Table ) . Multiple sequence 121 alignment by ClustalW program ( http : / / clustalw . ddbj . nig . ac . jp ) shows that the key catalytic 122 residues in the phosphatase domain ( H - C - K / R - A - G - K - G - R ) needed for lipid and protein 123 phosphatase activity [ 4 , 27 ] are well conserved in EhPTEN1 ( Fig 1C ) . In addition , the 124 PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding motif ( K / R - x4 - K / R - x - K / R - K / R - R , PDM domain ) , which is predicted to 125 regulate the recruitment of protein to the plasma membrane , located at the amino terminus , is also 126 conserved in EhPTEN1 [ 6 , 28 ] . The cytosolic localization signal ( D - G - F - x - L - D - L , CLS ) , where 127 mutation of phenylalanine was shown to induce nuclear localization [ 29 ] , as well as threonine and 128 isoleucine responsible for TI loop formation in an extension of the active site pocket are also 129 conserved ( Fig 1C ) [ 27 ] . EhPTEN1 also possesses C2 domain which has an affinity for membrane 130 phospholipids and helps PTEN to be recruited to the cell membrane [ 27 ] . InterPro domain search 131 annotates the region of a . a . 550 - 680 of EhPTEN1 as a domain of unknown function ( DUF457 ) . 132 The two PEST sequences , rich in proline , glutamic acid , serine , and threonine , at the C terminus 133 of human PTEN , are not conserved in EhPTEN1 . Although PEST sequences are known to enhance 134 proteolytic sensitivity , the regulation of EhPTEN1 functions may differ from the human PTEN 135 7 [ 30 ] . EhPTEN1 also lacks PDZ - binding motif ( T / S - x - V ) located at the C - terminal end in human 136 PTEN and facilitates the protein - protein interactions [ 6 , 31 ] . The ~ 400 a . a . carboxyl - terminal 137 extension which is absent in human ortholog and rich in charged amino acids could be involved in 138 regulating its protein - protein interactions . 139 Cellular localization and dynamics of EhPTEN1 in the motile E . histolytica trophozoite 140 To examine the cellular localization of EhPTEN1 in trophozoites , we established a transformant 141 line expressing EhPTEN1 with the GFP - tag at the amino terminus ( GFP - EhPTEN1 ) . The 142 expression of GFP - EhPTEN1 or GFP ( control ) in transformant trophozoites was verified by 143 immunoblot analysis using anti - GFP antibody . A single band corresponding to non - truncated GFP 144 fusion protein with an expected molecular mass of GFP - EhPTEN1 ( 90 kDa plus 26 kDa for the 145 GFP tag ) was observed in the GFP - EhPTEN1 - expressing transformant ( Fig 2A ) . Live imaging 146 analysis revealed that GFP - EhPTEN1 was localized throughout the cytosol ( Fig 2B and S1 Movie ) . 147 The line intensity plots across the GFP - PTEN1 overexpressing trophozoites further demonstrated 148 the enrichment of GFP - PTEN1 along the extended pseudopod of the motile trophozoite ( Fig 2B ) 149 ( Two additional images are also show in S1A and S1B Fig ) . The normalized average fluorescence 150 intensities at the leading regions of pseudopods were nearly 1 . 5 - fold higher in GFP - EhPTEN1 151 overexpressing trophozoites compared to mock transformants ( Fig 2C ) . Furthermore , the intensity 152 line plot of GFP - expressing control strain showed no accumulation of GFP signal on pseudopods 153 ( S2 Fig and S2 Movie ) . These findings confirm the enrichment of GFP - EhPTEN1 in the 154 pseudopod - like protrusive structures . Similarly , immunofluorescence imaging of HA - EhPTEN1 155 overexpressing trophozoites using anti - HA antibody revealed that HA - EhPTEN1 was localized in 156 the cytoplasm in steady - state , and enriched in pseudopods ( S3B and S3C Fig ) . The migration 157 ( motility ) of the GFP - EhPTEN1 overexpressing trophozoites using the montage of time - lapse 158 8 imaging was 0 . 54±0 . 09 µm / sec ( mean±S . D . ) , which was significantly greater than that of control 159 GFP expressing transformants ( 0 . 27±0 . 08 µm / sec ) ( Fig 2D ) . We also investigated the effect of 160 repression of EhPTEN1 gene expression and found that EhPTEN1 gene silencing reduced 161 migration ( see below ) . 162 Localization of EhPTEN1 during trogocytosis and phagocytosis 163 The fact that EhPTEN1 was previously identified as a PtdIns ( 3 ) P - binding effector and suggested 164 to be involved in the phagosome biogenesis [ 23 ] , prompted further characterization of the role of 165 EhPTEN1 in host cell internalization . To examine the role of EhPTEN1 in ingestion of mammalian 166 cells , we first examined trogocytosis ( i . e . , nibbling or chewing of a part of a live cell ) of Chinese 167 hamster ovary ( CHO ) cells by GFP - EhPTEN1 and GFP expressing transformant lines . We co - 168 cultured trophozoites of the two transformant lines with live CHO cells that had been stained with 169 CellTracker Orange . Time - lapse imaging of trogocytosis of CHO cells by the amoebae ( Fig 3A 170 and S3 Movie ) revealed that GFP - EhPTEN1 was accumulated in the region that covers , but not 171 always in close proximity to , the tunnel - like structure , which is the extended neck ( or tube ) - like 172 structure connecting the enclosed ( or being enclosed ) trogosome and the remaining portion of the 173 target cell that is partially ingested ( Fig 3A - 3D ) . Upon completion of closure of the trogosome , 174 GFP - EhPTEN1 appeared to be dissociated from the region around the trogosome and the tunnel - 175 like structure ( Fig 3A - 3E ) . The quantification of the fluorescence intensity in a cross section of the 176 cell confirmed the dynamism of GFP - EhPETN1 during trogocytosis ( Figs 3B - 3E ) . In contrast , at 177 the very early phase of trogocytosis , GFP - EhPTEN1 was not concentrated on the newly formed 178 trogocytic cup . 179 The dynamics of GFP - EhPTEN1 in a course of phagocytosis ( i . e . , internalization with a 180 single bite , not multiple bites ) of dead CHO cells was also examined . The live imaging of GFP - 181 9 EhPTEN1 expressing trophozoites co - cultured with pre - killed CHO cells ( Fig 4 and S4 Movie ) 182 showed an enrichment of GFP - EhPTEN1 at the tip of the leading edge of the phagocytic cup during 183 the internalization of dead host cells until phagosome closure ( Fig 4A and 4B ) . Soon after closure 184 of the phagosome , GFP - EhPTEN1 was concentrated on the closing side of the phagosome ( Fig 185 4A - 4C ) , and rapidly disappeared soon after ( Fig 4D ) . The fluorescence intensity line plot of a cross 186 section ( as indicated by arrows ) of the cell also reinforced the observation ( Figs 4A - 4D ) . As control , 187 GFP - expressing mock strain showed no observable concentration of GFP signal in a course of 188 CHO ingestion ( S5 Movie and S4 Fig ) . 189 Effect of overexpression of EhPTEN1 on trogocytosis and phagocytosis 190 The dynamism of GFP - EhPTEN1 , as revealed by live imaging , suggests that EhPTEN1 plays a 191 role in the early to middle stages of trogo - and phagocytosis . We examined the effect of GFP - 192 EhPTEN1 overexpression on the efficiency ( i . e . , speed and volume of internalization of prey ) of 193 trogocytosis and phagocytosis . GFP - EhPTEN1 expressing and mock transformant strains were 194 incubated with either live or pre - killed CHO cells that had been stained with CellTracker Orange 195 to allow trogocytosis or phagocytosis , respectively . Internalization of CHO cells by the amoebae 196 was measured by CQ1 confocal quantitative image cytometer ( Figs 5 and 6 ) . Three parameters 197 were measured and compared between GFP - EhPTEN1 expressing and mock transformant strains : 198 the number of CHO - containing trogosomes or phagosomes per ameba ( Figs 5A and 6A ) , the 199 volume of all CHO - containing trogosomes or phagosomes per ameba ( Figs 5B and 6B ) , and the 200 percentage of the amebae that ingested CHOs ( Figs 5C and 6C ) . GFP - EhPTEN1 overexpression 201 caused statistically significant reduction in all three parameters in both trogocytosis and 202 phagocytosis . 203 Gene silencing of EhPTEN1 enhances trogocytosis and phagocytosis in E . histolytica 204 10 Conversely , we attempted to verify if repression of EhPTEN1 gene expression by antisense small 205 RNA - mediated transcriptional gene silencing [ 32 ] causes reverse phenotypes : enhancement of 206 trogocytosis and phagocytosis . The silencing of the EhPTEN1 gene expression was confirmed by 207 RT - PCR and the level of silencing was estimated to be approximately 77 . 0±9 . 2 % compared to the 208 mock control ( G3 transfected with the empty psAP2 - Gunma vector ) ( Fig 7A and 7B ) . Non - specific 209 off - target gene silencing of other EhPTEN genes ( EhPTEN2 - 6 ) was ruled out , except for EhPTEN2 , 210 which showed a slight reduction in EhPTN1 gene silenced strain , validating gene - specific silencing 211 ( S5 Fig ) . The RNA pol II transcript level was also unaffected . EhPTEN1 gene silenced and mock 212 transformants were cultivated with live or dead CHO cells and images were captured every 10 min 213 for 1 hr . As expected , EhPTEN1 gene silenced strain showed an enhancement of trogocytosis and 214 phagocytosis ( Fig 8 ) . All three parameters to evaluate trogocytosis and phagocytosis , as above , 215 i . e . , the number of CHO - containing trogosomes or phagosomes per ameba ( Figs 8A and 8B ) , the 216 volume of all CHO - containing trogosomes or phagosomes per ameba ( Figs 8C and 8D ) , and the 217 percentage of the amebae that ingested CHOs ( Figs 8E and 8F ) was significantly increased in 218 EhPTEN1gene silenced strain compared to the mock control stain . For instance , the volume of 219 trogosomes and phagosomes increased by around 1 . 4 fold for trogocytosis and 2 fold for 220 phagocytosis , respectively , in EhPTEN1gene silenced strain at later time points of coincubation 221 ( at 40 - 60 mins ) . Together with the results of EhPTEN1 overexpression , shown above , these data 222 indicate that EhPTEN1 serves as a negative regulator of trogocytosis and phagocytosis . 223 EhPTEN1 is a positive regulator for the fluid - phase and receptor - mediated endocytosis in E . 224 histolytica 225 To investigate the role of EhPTEN1 in pinocytosis of the fluid - phase marker and receptor - 226 mediated endocytosis , we examined the internalization of RITC dextran and transferrin . 227 11 Pinocytosis was analyzed by measuring , on a fluorometer , the fluorescence intensity of fluid - phase 228 marker , RITC dextran , which was internalized after incubation of amoebic transformants with 229 RITC dextran at 35  C for up to 1 hr . Overexpression of GFP - EhPTEN1 cause approximately 30 % 230 increase in pinocytosis in comparison to mock control ( 53±5 . 3 or 28±13 % at time 30 or 60 min , 231 respectively ; p < 0 . 05 , Fig 9A ) . Conversely , EhPTEN1 gene silenced strain showed an 232 approximately 30 % decrease in pinocytosis at 30 - 60 min , as compared to mock control cells 233 ( 30±8 . 2 or 25±5 . 1 % decrease at time 30 or 60 min , respectively , p < 0 . 05 , Fig 9B ) . 234 We next examined internalization of transferrin conjugated with AlexaFluor 568 by CQ1 235 image cytometer . Transferrin is presumed to be internalized via receptor - mediated endocytosis . 236 The volume of endosomes that contained transferin - AlexaFluor 568 increased by 30 - 50 % in GFP - 237 EhPTEN1 overexpressing trophozoites compared to mock control at all time points up to 1 hr 238 ( p < 0 . 05 , Fig 10A ) . Conversely , transferrin endocytosis decreased by 30 - 40 % in EhPTEN1 gene 239 silenced strain compared to the mock strain at 40 - 60 mins ( p < 0 . 05 , Fig 10B ) . These data indicate 240 that EhPTEN1 positively regulates pinocytosis of the fluid - phase maker and receptor - mediated 241 endocytosis in E . histolytica . 242 EhPTEN1 is essential for optimum growth and migration of E . histolytica 243 The biological role of EhPTEN1 in trogo - , phagocytosis , and endocytosis was clearly 244 demonstrated as above . To investigate other physiological roles of EhPTEN1 in E . histolytica , the 245 growth kinetic was monitored in EhPTEN1 gene silenced and control strains . EhPTEN1 gene 246 silencing caused significant growth defect : the population doubling time of EhPTEN1 gene 247 silenced and control strains was 28 . 1±0 . 41 and 19 . 1±0 . 52 hr , respectively ( P < 0 . 05 ; Fig 7C ) . We 248 next examined the migration of the trophozoites of EhPTEN1 gene silenced and control strains 249 12 using time lapse imaging by CQ1 . The velocity of motility was > 60 % reduced in EhPTEN1 gene 250 silenced strain ( 0 . 16±0 . 07 µm / min ) compared to the mock control ( 0 . 44±0 . 08 µm / min ) ( Fig 7D ) . 251 Demonstration of phosphatase activity and substrate specificity of EhPTEN1 252 To see if EhPTEN1 possesses lipid phosphatase activity , bacterial recombinant EhPTEN1 with the 253 histidine tag at the amino terminus was produced using the pCOLD I E . coli expression system . 254 SDS - PAGE analysis followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining showed that the purified 255 recombinant EhPTEN1 was apparently homogenous with the predicted molecular mass of 96 kDa 256 including the histidine tag ( S6A Fig ) . Immunoblot analysis of the purified recombinant protein 257 using His - Tag antibody confirmed the absence of truncation ( S6B Fig ) . We first examined the 258 enzymatic activities of recombinant EhPTEN1 using a variety of phosphoinositides ( PIs ) as 259 substrates . EhPTEN1 revealed reasonable activity in a broad pH range with maximum activity 260 obtained at pH 6 . 0 when the reaction was performed with 50 µM PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 at 37°C for 40 261 min ( S6C Fig ) . We then determined the substrate specificity of EhPTEN1 , using a panel of di - C8 262 PIs . EhPTEN1 showed highest activity with PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 with the apparent specific activity of 263 8 . 18±0 . 78 nmol / min / mg ( Fig 11 ) . EhPTEN1 also catalyzed dephosphorylation of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 264 and PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 with 6 or 3 fold lower specific activities , respectively , compared to that toward 265 PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 . The activities against PI monophosphates and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 were relatively low . 266 All these characteristics are similar to those of human PTEN [ 33 , 34 ] . A comparison of kinetic 267 parameters of EhPTEN1 reveals a higher affinity towards PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( Km = 92 . 5 ± 4 . 72 µM ) 268 as compared to PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 ( 292 ± 18 . 8 µM ) and PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 ( 161 ± 20 . 1 ) demonstrating that 269 in vitro is as well the preferred substrate ( Table 1 , S8 Fig ) . 270 271 Table 1 . Kinetic parameters of EhPTEN1 . 272 13 Substrate Km ( µM ) Vmax ( nmoles min - 1 mg - 1 ) Kcat ( min - 1 ) 273 PI ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 292 ± 18 . 8 6 . 02 ± 1 . 11 0 . 11 ± 0 . 02 274 PI ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 161 ± 20 . 1 8 . 40 ± 0 . 42 0 . 15 ± 0 . 01 275 PI ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 92 . 5 ± 4 . 72 16 . 9 ± 1 . 83 0 . 31 ± 0 . 03 276 Assay was performed as described in Materials and methods in the presence of MOPS , EhPTEN1 , 277 and PtdInsPs . Reaction was conducted at 37ºC at pH 6 . 0 . Mean ± SEM of duplicates are shown . 278 279 Demonstration of phospholipid binding of EhPTEN1 280 The lipid overlay assay using amebic lysates from GFP - EhPTEN1 expressing and mock 281 transformants showed that EhPTEN1 preferentially bound to PtdIns ( 3 ) P , PtdIns ( 4 ) P , PtdIns ( 5 ) P , 282 and , to a lesser extent , PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 , and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( S7 Fig ) . Furthermore , recombinant His - 283 tagged EhPTEN1 also revealed a similar binding affinity toward a panel of PIs on the membrane , 284 which is similar to the data given for recombinant human PTEN [ 35 ] . 285 286 Discussion 287 PTEN regulates fundamental roles in higher eukaryotes including cell survival , metabolic changes , 288 cell polarity , and migration [ 9 ] . In this study , we have characterized the pivotal functions of 289 EhPTEN1 in migration , endocytosis , and cellular proliferation in E . histolytica . Confocal live 290 imaging demonstrated the involvement of EhPTEN1 in the initial and intermediate stages of 291 trogocytosis and phagocytosis . In trogocytosis of a live mammalian cell , EhPTEN1 was enriched 292 in the region where the trogocytic tunnel was newly formed . Similarly , EhPTEN1 was 293 accumulated on the cell periphery close to the leading edge of the phagocytic cup during the 294 internalization of a dead host cell . The recruitment of EhPTEN1 was transient as it gradually 295 14 became dissociated from the region after the completion of ingestion . These results are in line with 296 the previous study that showed PTEN was associated with forming IgG conjugated zymosan 297 containing phagosomes but disappeared once particle ingestion was completed [ 36 ] . The 298 biochemical analysis showed that GFP - EhPTEN1 overexpression caused a reduction in 299 trogocytosis and phagocytosis . In good agreement with these results , knockdown of EhPTEN1 300 caused remarkable enhancement in phagocytosis of dead CHO cells while trogocytosis toward live 301 CHO cells was slightly increased . These results match those observed in earlier studies where 302 PTEN deficient macrophages displayed enhanced phagocytic ability both in vitro and in vivo , 303 while overexpression of PTEN significantly inhibited phagocytosis in macrophages [ 12 , 37 - 39 ] . It 304 was previously demonstrated that PTEN down - regulates phagocytosis through dephosphorylation 305 of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 , which subsequently affects the downstream events such as the activation of 306 Rac through the pleckstrin homology domain - containing guanine - nucleotide exchange factor , 307 Vav1 [ 12 ] . The depletion of PTEN in macrophage resulted in elevated PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 levels , 308 leading to activation of Vav1 and subsequent activation of Rac1 GTPase , the latter of which 309 induces F - actin polymerization , which in turn enhances the engulfment of targeted cells [ 40 ] . 310 Furthermore , it has been shown that PTEN negatively regulates Fc  receptor - mediated 311 phagocytosis by repressing the conversion of Rac - bound GDP to GTP downstream [ 11 ] . While 312 PIPs - mediated signaling and downstream effector in E . histolytica is not yet well understood , it 313 has been recently reported that two AGC kinases from E . histolytica have the ability to bind 314 PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 and are involved in a panel of endocytic events including trogo - , phago - , and 315 pinocytosis [ 21 ] . In addition , it has also been shown that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is localized on the plasma 316 membrane whereas PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 is localized on the phagocytic cup and the extended 317 pseudopodia in E . histolytica trophozoites [ 41 , 42 ] . These observations suggest that the control of 318 15 PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 synthesis and decomposition are important for the regulation of endocytic events 319 in E . histolytica . We have clearly demonstrated phosphatase activity and preferred substrate 320 specificity toward PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 of EhPTEN1 . Hence , it is highly conceivable that EhPTEN1 321 can regulate the local concentrations of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 at the target sites during 322 trogo - and phagocytic processes . It seems conceivable that EhPTEN1 negatively regulates trogo - 323 and phagocytosis by reducing the local PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 concentration , leading to the suppression 324 of actin - dependent cytoskeletal reorganization needed for trogo - and phagocytosis . Indeed , the 325 concentration of EhPTEN1 is swiftly reduced on and close to trogo - and phagocytic cups ( not - yet - 326 enclosed ) and trogosomes and phagosomes ( enclosed ) soon after the completion of ingestion . 327 We have shown that EhPTEN1 is involved in receptor - mediated endocytosis and 328 macropinocytosis of the fluid - phase marker in an opposite fashion as in trogo - and phagocytosis . 329 GFP - EhPTEN1 overexpression enhanced transferrin uptake while EhPTEN1 gene silencing 330 decreased it . It was shown that at least two concentration - dependent mechanisms for transferrin 331 endocytosis exist in E . histolytica [ 43 ] : Receptor - mediated endocytosis active at low transferrin 332 concentrations [ 44 ] and receptor - independent internalization at high transferrin concentrations 333 [ 45 ] . As previously demonstrated , receptor - mediated endocytosis of transferrin in E . histolytica is 334 indeed clathrin - mediated [ clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) ] [ 46 ] , and receptor - mediated 335 endocytosis is in general clathrin - mediated and actin independent [ 47 ] . Unlike trogo - and 336 phagocytosis , CME is also distinct in that it depends on PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and does not require 337 PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 [ 47 , 48 ] . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binds and recruits several proteins associated with CME 338 formation thus depleting cells of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 prevents transferrin receptor endocytosis [ 1 , 47 - 49 ] . 339 Taken together , EhPTEN1 possibly facilitates the transferrin internalization through augmentation 340 of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis . Furthermore , EhPTEN1 showed similar phenotypes toward pinocytosis 341 16 of the fluid - phase marker . As stated above , transferrin , when present at high concentrations , is 342 internalized by receptor independent fashion in E . histolytica [ 45 ] . Thus , it is consistent with our 343 observation that E . histolytica internalization of the fluid - phase marker and transferrin by actin - 344 dependent macropinocytosis ( S7 and S8 Movies ) , also as previously shown [ 50 ] . We also 345 previously showed that EhAGCK2 , which preferentially binds PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 over PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , 346 is involved in pinocytosis of the fluid - phase marker [ 21 ] , supporting the actin - dependence of 347 macropinocytosis . However , it was shown that the local production of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in the early 348 stages of macropinocytosis is essential for the formation of ruffles and is partly responsible for the 349 remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton [ 51 ] . Although phagocytosis and macropinocytosis both 350 construct a cup in an actin - dependent manner , phagocytosis is a receptor - guided zipper - like model 351 that conforms to particle geometry while macropinocytosis is self - organized with little or no 352 guidance from receptors and can form in the absence of particles [ 52 ] . Moreover , a number of 353 previous studies have shown that macropinocytosis and phagocytosis are distinct . For instance , 354 RacC or Rap1 overexpressing cells or profilin - null cells displayed a higher phagocytosis rate but 355 macropinocytosis was significantly reduced [ 53 - 55 ] . It has been reported previously that deletion 356 of PTEN in Dictyostelium discoideum caused a reduction in fluid uptake [ 56 ] . Nevertheless , the 357 lipid rafts in the plasma membrane of E . histolytica is highly enriched with PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 [ 42 ] and 358 disruption of lipid rafts with cholesterol - binding agents significantly inhibited fluid - phase 359 pinocytosis of E . histolytica [ 57 ] . Altogether , we assume that EhPTEN1 accelerates transient 360 synthesis of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 on the plasma membrane which in turn facilitates the formation of actin - 361 associated macropinocytic cup . This study has provide the first observation that PTEN is 362 differentially involved in multiple actin - related cytoskeletal activities . 363 17 We have shown that repression of gene expression of EhPTEN1 caused significant growth 364 defect . This phenotype can be possibly explained by reduced ability in nutrient uptake . 365 Furthermore , it was previously demonstrated that the growth defect in E . histolytica in low iron 366 medium was rescued by the addition of iron - loaded holo - transferrin , and that holo - transferrin was 367 recognized by an amoebic transferrin receptor and endocytosed via clathrin - coated vesicles [ 44 , 58 ] . 368 These data , taken together , underscore the importance of endocytosis of transferrin for the 369 proliferation of amoebae . Macropinocytosis was previsouly identified as a mechanism by which 370 malignant cells satisfy their unique metabolic needs and hence support cancer progression [ 59 ] . In 371 the amoebae , macropinocytosis is the primary and widely used method for feeding [ 60 ] . On the 372 other hand , the downstream signaling molecules that correspond to mammalian PTEN and are 373 related to cellular proliferation , such as B cell lymphoma 2 associated agonist of cell death ( BAD ) 374 and cyclin - dependent kinase inhibitor p27 [ 5 , 8 ] , have not yet been identified in E . histolytica . 375 Instead , E . histolytica possesses two genes encoding TOR - like proteins by biocomputational 376 approach [ 61 ] . These data may suggest that regulation of amoebic growth by PTEN is distinct in 377 E . histolytica . On the other hand , it was previously shown that loss of PTEN significantly lowered 378 growth in D . discoideum , possibly attributable to mislocalization of myosin II during cytokinesis 379 [ 62 , 63 ] . Similarly , myosin II mutants caused reduction in growth and multinucleation in E . 380 histolytica [ 64 ] . These observations likely support the premise that EhPTEN1 regulates amoebic 381 cell proliferation by regulation of cytokinesis and / or nutrient uptake by macropinocytosis . 382 Furthermore , the requirement of EhPTEN1 for optimum proliferation indicates that E . histolytica 383 apparently does not possess compensatory mechanisms for the PIPs dysregulation caused by the 384 loss of EhPTEN1 , and thus have posed it as rational drug target . 385 18 We have shown that EhPTEN1 , in two forms of tagged / fusion proteins , GFP - EhPTEN1 386 and HA - EhPTEN1 , enhances cell migration while repression of EhPTEN1 gene expression causes 387 inhibition of motility . These observations agree well with the fact that EhPTEN1 was transiently 388 concentrated in newly formed pseudopods . The GFP - EhPTEN1 distribution in E . histolytica is 389 similar to the localization of mammalian PTEN , which predominantly shows cytosolic localization 390 and mediates conversion of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 through dynamic interaction with the 391 inner face of the plasma membrane [ 65 , 66 ] . It was also shown that in D . discoideum the 392 localization of PTEN changed in response to the chemoattractant stimulation via increase in 393 extracellular cAMP . In resting cells , PTEN is uniformly associated with the plasma membrane , 394 but upon chemoattractant stimulation , PTEN transiently dissociates from the membrane and 395 diffuses into the cytosol with accumulation at the rear of the chemotaxis cells [ 67 ] . These data 396 suggest that EhPTEN1 is involved in pseudopods formation and motility . In D . discoideum , PTEN 397 was also implicated in cell migration as a positive regulator of motility , because an ameba strain 398 lacking PTEN showed a reduction in migration speed and defect in chemotactic efficiency due to 399 disruption of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 / PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentration gradient throughout the cell [ 68 - 70 ] . In 400 contrast , in mammalian cell types including B cells , glioma cells , and fibroblasts , PTEN was 401 shown to inhibit migration [ 71 , 8 ] . The behavioral analysis of D . discoideum showed that loss of 402 PTEN caused a reduction in cell motility due to their inability to repress the formation of lateral 403 pseudopodia that misdirect them , compared with wild - type cells , which produce only one large 404 pseudopod at a time [ 68 , 69 ] . In addition , loss of PTEN also resulted in dysregulation of myosin II 405 assembly at the cell cortex , where PTEN prevents the formation of lateral pseudopodia and 406 promotes cell body contraction and posterior retraction in D . discoideum [ 68 , 72 ] . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , 407 produced by PTEN , can recruit and activate a wide variety of actin regulatory proteins at the 408 19 plasma membrane , thereby controlling motility [ 1 , 48 ] . For example , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 activates N - 409 WASP directly or indirectly through interaction with IQGAP1 which result in promoting actin 410 polymerization by activation of N - WASP – Arp2 / 3 complex [ 1 , 48 , 73 ] . Among them , myosin II and 411 Arp2 / 3 complex are conserved in E . histolytica , where myosin II plays a critical role in movement 412 [ 64 , 74 ] and Arp2 / 3 complex is involved in actin nucleation [ 75 ] . Thus , it is conceivable that 413 EhPTEN1 mediates signaling for pseudopod formation and migration through regulation of 414 PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 metabolism . 415 In conclusion , we have shown the biological significance of EhPTEN1 in different forms 416 of endocytosis including trogocytosis , phagocytosis , pinocytosis , and clathrin - mediated 417 endocytosis . We have also demonstrated the essentiality of EhPTEN1 in pseudopod formation , 418 motility , and optimal growth of E . histolytica . Taken together , these findings emphasize the 419 importance of EhPTEN1 in modulating a plethora of functions in E . histolytica . Exploring PTEN 420 functions in E . histolytica will hopefully increase our knowledge on the regulation of cellular 421 processes related to actin remodeling through the PIPs signaling pathway . Also , it will inform the 422 rational design of novel therapies against eukaryotic pathogens . 423 424 Materials and methods 425 Identification and comparison of PTEN sequences 426 Amino acid sequences of PTEN from E . histolytica and other organisms were gained from 427 AmoebaDB ( http : / / amoebadb . org / amoeba / ) and NCBI ( https : / / www . ncbi . nlm . nih . gov ) 428 respectively , and aligned using CLUSTAL W program ( http : / / clustalw . ddbj . nig . ac . jp / ) to examine 429 the domain configuration and the key residues for phosphatase activity [ 76 ] . 430 Organisms , cultivation , and reagents 431 20 Trophozoites of E . histolytica clonal strains HM - 1 : IMSS cl6 and G3 strain were cultured 432 axenically in 6 ml screw - capped Pyrex glass tubes in Diamond’s BI - S - 33 ( BIS ) medium at 35 . 5°C 433 as described previously [ 77 - 79 ] . CHO cells were grown at 37°C in F12 medium ( Invitrogen - Gibco , 434 New York , U . S .

The PCR - 450 amplified fragments were digested with XmaI and XhoI and cloned into pEhEx - HA and pEhEx - 451 GFP vectors [ 21 , 22 ] that had been predigested with XmaI and XhoI , to produce pEhExHA - 452 EhPTEN1 and pEhExGFP - EhPTEN1 . For antisense small RNA - mediated transcriptional 453 silencing of EhPTEN1 gene , a 420 bp fragment of the protein coding region of EhPTEN1 gene , 454 21 corresponding to the amino terminus of the protein , was amplified by PCR from cDNA with sense 455 and antisense oligonucleotides containing StuI and SacI restriction sites ( S2 Table ) . The amplified 456 product was digested with StuI and SacI and ligated into the compatible sites of the double digested 457 psAP2 - Gunma plasmid [ 80 ] to synthesize a gene silencing plasmid designated as psAP2 - 458 EhPTEN1 . Two plasmids , pEhExHA - EhPTEN1 and pEhExGFP - EhPTEN1 , were introduced into 459 the trophozoites of E . histolytica HM - 1 : IMSS cl6 strain , whereas psAP2 - EhPTEN1 was 460 introduced into G3 strain by lipofection as described previously [ 81 ] . Transformants were initially 461 selected in the presence of 1 μg / ml G418 until the drug concentration was gradually increased to 462 10 μg / ml for the EhPTEN1 gene silenced stain and 20 μg / ml for the GFP - and HA - EhPTEN1 463 overexpressing stains . Finally , all transformants were maintained at 10 or 20 μg / ml G418 in BIS 464 medium . 465 Reverse transcriptase PCR 466 Reverse transcriptase PCR was performed to check mRNA levels of EhPTEN1 in EhPTEN1 gene 467 silenced and control strains . Total RNA was extracted from trophozoites of EhPTEN1 gene 468 silenced and control strains that were cultivated in the logarithmic phase using TRIZOL reagent 469 ( Life Technologies , California , USA ) . Approximately one µg of DNase treated total RNA was 470 used for cDNA synthesis using Superscript III First - Strand Synthesis System ( Thermo Fisher 471 Scientific , Massachusetts , USA ) with reverse transcriptase and oligo ( dT ) primer according to the 472 manufacture’s protocol . Ex Taq PCR system was used to amplify DNA from the cDNA template 473 using the primer pairs listed in S2 Table . The PCR conditions were as follow : initial denaturation 474 at 98  C for 10 sec ; then 25 cycles at 98  C for 10 sec , 55  C for 30 sec , and 72  C for 20 sec ; and a 475 final extension at 72  C for 7 min . The PCR products obtained were resolved by agarose gel 476 electrophoresis . 477 22 Immunoblot analysis 478 Trophozoites of amoeba transformants expressing HA - EhPTEN1 or GFP - EhPTEN1 grown in the 479 exponential growth phase were harvested and washed three times with phosphate buffer saline 480 ( PBS ) . After resuspension in lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % Triton - 481 X 100 , 0 . 5 mg / ml E - 64 , and protease inhibitor ) , the trophozoites were kept on ice for 30 min , 482 followed by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min . Approximately 20 µg of the total cell lysates were 483 separated on 10 % SDS - PAGE and subsequently electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes . 484 The membranes were incubated in 5 % non - fat dried milk in Tris - Buffered Saline and Tween - 20 485 ( TBST ; 50 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , and 0 . 05 % Tween - 20 ) for 1 hr at room 486 temperature to block non - specific protein . The blots were reacted with one of the following 487 primary antibodies diluted as indicated : anti - HA 16B12 monoclonal mouse antibody at a dilution 488 of 1 : 1 , 000 , anti - GFP mouse monoclonal antibody ( 1 : 100 ) , and anti - CS1 rabbit polyclonal antisera 489 [ 82 ] ( 1 : 1 , 000 ) at 4  C overnight . The membranes were washed with TBST and further reacted with 490 horseradish peroxidase - conjugated ( HRP ) anti - mouse or anti - rabbit IgG antisera ( 1 : 10 , 000 ) at 491 room temperature for 1 hr . After washings with TBST , the specific proteins were visualized with 492 a chemiluminescence HRP Substrate system ( Millipore , Massachusetts , USA ) using LAS 4000 493 ( Fujifilm Life Science , Cambridge , USA ) according to the manufacture’s protocol . 494 Live cell imaging 495 Approximately 5×10 5 trophozoites of the transformant strain expressing GFP - EhPTEN1 were 496 cultured on a 35 mm ( in diameter ) collagen - coated glass - bottom dish ( MatTek Corporation , 497 Massachusetts , USA ) in 3 ml of BIS medium under anaerobic conditions . CHO cells were stained 498 with BIS medium containing 10 µM CellTracker Orange for 40 min followed by washing three 499 times with PBS . Approximately 2×10 4 prestained CHO cells 200  l BIS were gently overlayed to 500 23 trophozoites grown on the glass - bottom dish as prepared above . The central part of the dish was 501 then carefully covered with a 1 cm square coverslip and the edge of the coverslip on the slide glass 502 was sealed with nail polish . Live imaging was performed , images were captured on Zeiss LSM780 503 confocal microscope , and analyzed by ZEN software ( Carl - Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) . 504 Indirect immunofluorescence assay ( IFA ) 505 Approximately 5×10 3 trophozoites in 50  l BIS were transferred to an 8 mm round well on a slide 506 glass ( Matsunami Glass Ind , Osaka , Japan ) . After 30 min incubation in an anaerobic chamber at 507 35 . 5°C , 5×10 4 CHO cells that had been pre - stained with 10  M CellTracker Blue in 50  l BIS 508 were added to the well and the mixture was incubated for 15 min . After removing the medium , 509 cells were fixed with PBS containing 3 . 7 % paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min , 510 and subsequently permeabilized with PBS containing 0 . 2 % Triton 100 - X and 1 % bovine serum 511 albumin ( BSA ) for 10 min each at room temperature . The cells were then reacted with anti - HA 512 mouse monoclonal antibody ( 1 : 1000 ) for 1 hr at room temperature . Then the sample was reacted 513 with Alexa Flouor - 488 conjugated anti - mouse IgG ( 1 : 1000 ) antibody ( Thermo Fisher , 514 Massachusetts , USA ) . The images were then captured using LSM 780 confocal microscope and 515 analyzed by ZEN software ( Carl - Zeiss , Oberkochen , Germany ) . 516 Trogocytosis and phagocytosis assay using CQ1 517 Trophozoites of E . histolytica were incubated in BIS containing 10 µM CellTracker Blue ( Thermo 518 Fisher ) at 35 . 5°C for 1 hr . After staining , ameba trophozoites were washed 3 times with PBS and 519 resuspended in OPTI - MEM medium ( Thermo Fisher , Massachusetts , USA ) containing 15 % adult 520 bovine serum ( Sigma Aldrich ) . Approximately 2×10 4 ameba trophozoites were seeded into a well 521 on a 96 - well glass bottom plate ( IWAKI , Shizuoka , Japan ) and incubated in anaerobic chamber 522 for 40 min . After incubation , about 1×10 5 live or heat killed CHO cells that have been stained with 523 24 10 µM CellTracker Orange were added to the well containing amebae . The images were taken on 524 a Confocal Quantitative image cytometer CQ1 ( Yokogawa Electric Corporation , Tokyo , Japan ) 525 using 20× objective every 10 min for 1 hr . The images were analyzed using CellPathfinder 526 software ( Yokogawa Electric Corporation , Tokyo , Japan ) according to the manufacture’s protocol . 527 The multiple parameters were measured to evaluate the efficiency of trogocytosis and 528 phagocytosis : the average number of internalized CHO cells per amoeba , the combined volume of 529 internalized CHO cells per amoeba , and the percentage of amebic trophozoites that ingested the 530 target cells in the whole population . 531 Measurement of fluid - phase and receptor - mediated endocytosis 532 Approximately 2 . 5×10 5 amebic transformants were incubated in BIS medium containing 2 mg / ml 533 fluorescent fluid - phase marker RITC dextran at 35°C for indicated time points . The cells were 534 collected , washed three times with PBS , and resuspended in 250 µl of lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris - 535 HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 150 mM NaCl , and 0 . 1 % Triton - X 100 ) . Fluorescence intensity was measured using 536 a plate reader ( SpectraMax Paradigm Multi - Mode , Molecular Devices , California , USA ) at an 537 excitation wavelength of 570 nm and an emission wavelength of 610 nm . 538 Approximately 2×10 4 amebic transformants were incubated in BIS containing 20 μM 539 CellTracker Blue ( Thermo Fisher ) at 35 . 5°C for 1 hr . After staining , approximately 10 4 amebic 540 transformants resuspended in 100 µl of BIS medium were transferred to a well on a 96 - well 541 glass - bottom plate . After incubation at 35 . 5°C in an anaerobic chamber for 40 min , 0 . 5 mg / ml of 542 transferrin conjugate with Alexa Fluor 568 was added to the well and images were acquired by 543 CQ1 and analyzed as above . 544 Migration ( motility ) assay 545 25 Amoebic trophozoites grown in the logarithmic growth phase were harvested and labelled with 20 546 µM CellTracker Green for 1 hr at 35 . 5°C . After washing 3 times with PBS , cells were transferred 547 to a well on a 96 - well glass - bottom plate and time lapse images were captured on CQ1 . The 548 motility of the cells was measured using CellPathfinder software . 549 Quantitative real - time ( qRT ) PCR 550 The relative levels of mRNA of EhPTEN1 gene and RNA polymerase II gene , as an internal 551 standard , were measured by qRT - PCR . PCR reaction was prepared using Fast SYBR Master Mix 552 ( Applied Biosystems , California , USA ) with 100 ng cDNA and a primer set shown in S1 Table . 553 PCR was conducted using the StepOne Plus Real - Time PCR system ( Applied Biosystems , 554 California , USA ) with the following cycling conditions : an initial step of denaturation at 95  C for 555 20 sec , followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95  C for 3 sec , annealing and extension at 60  C 556 for 30 sec . The mRNA expression level of EhPTEN1 gene in the transformants was expressed as 557 relative to that in the control transfected with psAP2 . 558 Growth assay of E . histolytica trophozoites 559 Approximately 10 4 trophozoites of E . histolytica G3 strain transformed with psAP2 - EhPTEN1 and 560 psAP2 ( control ) , grown in the logarithmic phase , were inoculated into 6 ml of fresh BI - S - 33 561 medium containing 10 μg / mL G418 , and the parasites were counted every 24 hr on a 562 hemocytometer . 563 Production of EhPTEN1 recombinant protein 564 To construct the plasmid for the production of recombinant EhPTEN1 containing a histidine - tag 565 at the amino terminus , the full - length protein coding sequence of EhPTEN1 gene was amplified 566 by PCR using oligonucleotide primers listed in S2 Table . PCR was performed with PrimeSTAR 567 Max DNA polymerase ( Takara Bio Inc , Shiga , Japan ) with the following parameters : initial 568 26 incubation at 95°C for 1 min ; followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 98°C for 10 sec ; annealing 569 at 55°C for 5 sec ; and elongation at 72°C for 15 sec ; and a final extension at 72°C for 30 sec . The 570 PCR fragment was digested with Bam HI and Sal I and ligated into Bam HI and Sal I double digested 571 pCOLD - 1 vector ( Takara Bio Inc , Shiga , Japan ) to produce pCOLD1 - EhPTEN1 plasmid . The 572 pCOLD - 1 - EhPTEN1 was introduced into E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) cells by heat shock at 42°C for 45 573 sec . E . coli BL21 ( DE3 ) strain harboring pCOLD - 1 - EhPTEN1 was grown at 37°C in 50 ml of LB 574 medium ( BD Difco , New Jersey , USA ) in the presence of 100 µg / ml ampicillin . The overnight 575 culture was used to inoculate 500 ml of fresh medium , and the culture was further continued at 576 37°C with shaking at 220 rpm for approximately 2 hr . When A 600 absorbance reached 0 . 6 , then 577 1mM of isopropyl β - D - thio galactopyranoside ( IPTG ) was added , and cultivation was continued 578 for another 24 hr at 15°C . The E . coli cells from the induced culture were harvested by 579 centrifugation at 75 , 000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C . The cell pellet was washed three times with PBS , 580 re - suspended in 30 ml of the lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris – HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 300 mM NaCl , and 0 . 1 % 581 Triton X - 100 ) containing 100 µg / ml lysozyme , and 1 mM phenylmethyl sulfonyl ﬂuoride ( PMSF ) , 582 and incubated at room temperature for 30 min . After incubation , the mixture was sonicated on ice 583 and centrifuged at 13 , 000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C . The supernatant was mixed with 1 ml of 50 % 584 Ni 2 + - NTA His - bind resin ( Qiagen , Hilden , Germany ) , incubated for 1 hr at 4°C with mild rotatory 585 shaking . The resin that recombinant His - EhPTEN1 bound was washed in a disposal column three 586 times with 5 ml of lysis buffer containing 10 - 30 mM of imidazole .
