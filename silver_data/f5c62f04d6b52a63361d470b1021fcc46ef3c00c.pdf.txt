Seventy - four residents and 53 members of staff were included in the present study . The staff underwent nasopharyngeal swab tests for SARS - CoV - 2 , and both the staff and residents underwent serological tests to detect IgG antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 . The results of all of the tests were negative . Conversely , 94 % of residents and 38 % members of the staff were tested positive to the nasopharyngeal swab tests during the second COVID - 19 pandemic wave ( data collected from November 1 to November 30 , 2020 ) . Our experience suggests that , in the presence of a life - threatening pandemic such as SARS - CoV - 2 infection , the prompt use of restrictive procedures can prevent the spread and progression of disease in assisted living facilities in the short term but may fail in the long term , especially when the prevalence of the COVID - 19 greatly increased outside the facility enhancing the risk of import the disease from outside . SARS - CoV - 2 vaccination of residents and staff members would contribute to control / limit the prevalence and the spread of the virus . Key words : COVID - 19 ; SARS - CoV - 2 ; assisted living facilities - 3 - HIGHLIGHTS  Long - term care residents are particularly vulnerable to COVID - 19 and account for nearly half of the worldwide total number of deaths recorded during the pandemic .

INTRODUCTION On February 14 2020 , three colleagues met for lunch in a restaurant on “that branch of Lake Como” in Lombardy : two were infectious disease physicians and the third was the health director of the Cesare e Emilio Prandoni Onlu s , an assisted living facility located in the lakeside village of Torno , in the province of Como . Much of their discussion concerned the latest news about coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ( SARS - CoV - 2 ) which , although it was still confined to China at the time , could possibly spread to Italy and would then require strategies to contain it . In the following week , on February 20 , the first Italian case of SARS - CoV - 2 infection was recorded in the small Lombard town of Codogno , and proved to be the harbinger of the outbreak that would severely hit Italy ( and particularly Lombardy ) in the following months . Remembering his lunchtime discussion of the previous week , and worried about the evidence emerging from China that indicated the efficient person - to - person transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in family homes and hospitals , and more severe clinical pictures in older patients 1 , the director of Cesare e Emilio Prandoni Onlus took the precautionary decision to close access to visitors ( including family members ) and suppliers on February 23 . This paper describes the clinical outcomes of the residents during the first closure , and the results of facility - wide SARS - CoV - 2 testing carried out in June 2020 before the facility partially reopened and compared it with the second SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic wave started in Northern Italy from the end of October 2020 . 2 . METHODS During the first closure of the Prandoni assisted living facility , which lasted from February 23 up to June 22 , 2020 , a ) the residents were not allowed to receive visitors and could only leave the facility for non - deferrable medical reasons ; b ) suppliers and couriers were not allowed to enter , and deliveries were made outside the facility under the strict control of the staff ; c ) staff members were constantly urged to use personal protective equipment ( PPE ) such as gloves and surgical masks - 5 - when assisting the residents and in their everyday lives at home ( staff members were allowed to sleep in their homes ) , and to respect always correct hand hygiene . The management of assisted living facility had identified members within its staff with the task of overseeing the correct application of the restrictive rules ( no control on the correct use of PPE was of course available while staff members were with their families at home ) . The same stringent rules were reapplied also during the second COVID - 19 pandemic wave started in Northern Italy from the end of October 2020 . During the summer , instead , residents were allowed to receive a visit from one family member ( both with PPE ) for 30 minutes once a week under staff control preferably in the gardens of the facility . In June 2020 , dedicated questionnaires , completed by the attending physician , were used to collect detailed information concerning the residents’ main demographic features , co - morbidities , clinical symptoms and / or hospital admissions during the first closure . The staff questionnaire also covered their role in the assisted living facility , the specific training received concerning the use of PPE , and their potential contacts or involvement with patient / family members with diagnosed or suspected SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Some basic information about the building housing the assisted living facility was also collected . During June 2020 , the staff members underwent nasopharyngeal swab testing for SARS - CoV - 2 , and both the residents and staff underwent serological testing to detect antibodies against SARS - CoV - 2 . The first assay identifies the virus by multiplex real - time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( RT - PCR ) targeting three virus genes ( E , RNA - dependent RNA polymerase and N ) ; the second assay is based on the detection of SARS - CoV - 2 specific IgG in serum or plasma . We decided not to perform nasopharyngeal swab to asymptomatic elderly patients to limit their discomfort . The clinical outcomes of the residents during the first closure was compared with the second SARS - CoV - 2 pandemic wave observed in Italy from November 1 , 2020 . The overall population frequency data were stratified by gender and are expressed as absolute numbers and percentages ; the other measures are expressed as mean values ± standard deviation . - 6 - The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Cesare e Emilio Prandoni Onlus . 3 . RESULTS The Cesare e Emilio Prandoni Onlus assisted living facility consists of 62 rooms : 46 single and 16 double rooms . During the first observational period ( 23 February – 22 June 2020 ) , there were 82 residents and 53 members of staff ( two of the members of staff did not complete the questionnaire ) . None of the eight deaths recorded during the study period were due to infectious diseases ( the number of deaths recorded during the same period of 2018 and 2019 was respectively 10 and 9 ) . Accordingly , data on 74 residents and 51 staff members were considered in the final analyses . The large majority of the residents included in the study were females and significantly older than the males ( 91±5 vs 86±5 years ; p < 0 . 01 ) . All residents were Caucasians . Three of the 74 residents left the facility to go to hospital because of femur fracture , epistaxis , and severe anemia , respectively . Ninety - one percent of the residents had at least one co - morbidity the most frequent of which were arterial hypertension , ischemic cardiomyopathy , cerebrovascular diseases and dementia . None of the residents was positive for SARS - CoV - 2 IgG in June 2020 . The main characteristics of the residents are shown in Table 1 . Most of the staff members were females : their mean age of 47±9 years was not different from that of their male colleagues ( Table 2 ) . Fifty percent of the staff had received specific training in the use of PPE during the previous year , and 84 % declared they had good or excellent knowledge of the use of PPE . None of the 51 staff members who completed the questionnaire declared that they had been involved in the care of subjects with suspected or confirmed SARS - CoV - 2 infection , but one declared contact with COVID - 19 patients in the previous three months . None of the staff members ( including the two who did not complete the questionnaire ) was positive for SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR or for SARS - CoV - 2 IgG serology ( all of the tests were carried out in June 2020 ) . No members of the staff families become sick with COVID - 19 during the first observational period . To the best of our knowledge , no cases of COVID - 19 were recorded in the village of Torno ( 1144 citizens ) during - 7 - the first COVID - 19 pandemic wave . During the same observational period , 4093 people out of 599 , 204 inhabitants ( 0 . 68 % ) of the province of Como were tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 infection . In autumn 2020 , a second COVID - 19 pandemic wave was observed in Northern Italy . From November , 1 to November 30 , 2020 , 68 out of 72 ( 94 % ) of residents and 20 ( 39 % ) members of the staff were tested positive to the nasopharyngeal swab test . Thirteen residents ( 4 males , mean age 86±2 years ; 9 females , mean age 93±5 years , p = 0 . 015 ) died because of the SARS - CoV - 2 infection . Of the remaining residents , 25 were asymptomatic and 30 have had a wide range of symptoms ( some patients had more than 1 symptom ) , specifically : fever ( 17 ) , shortness of breath ( 16 ) , fatigue ( 8 ) , cough ( 8 ) , headache ( 3 ) , runny nose ( 1 ) . Sixteen out of 30 residents required oxygen treatment , none required mechanical ventilation . Five patients lost their independence in activities of daily living after SARS - CoV - 2 infection . During the same observational period , 6 . 8 % of citizens of Torno and 3 . 8 % of citizen from the province of Como were tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 infection . At the last available follow - up ( 24 December 2020 ) all residents and members of the staff were tested negative for SARS - CoV - 2 RT - PCR . 4 . DISCUSSION Long - term care residents are particularly vulnerable to COVID - 19 and account for nearly half of the worldwide total number of deaths recorded during the pandemic . 2 - 9 This is due to the frailty of this population ( long - term elderly residents are at the highest risk of lethal infections because of their age and the high frequency of co - morbidities ) and the fact that the closed environment in which they live can favor the spread of infection . A number of outbreaks of COVID - 19 have been recorded among residents and staff in assisted living communities for older adults , 6 , 10 , 11 and McMichael et al . have shown that , once SARS - CoV - 2 infection has entered a long - term care facility , it can lead to high attack rates among residents , staff members and visitors . 12 This situation - 8 - is further aggravated by recent findings suggesting that screening based on symptoms may fail to identify cases of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in 50 % of long - term care residents . 13 Consequently , unrecognized asymptomatic and pre - symptomatic infections may contribute to the perpetuation of viral transmission . Taken together , these findings indicate that , in the context of rapidly escalating fatal outbreaks of COVID - 19 , it is critical that long - term care facilities implement active measures to prevent the entry of SARS - CoV - 2 . In addition to the identification ( and exclusion ) of symptomatic staff members , the recently released Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) recommendations include restricting visitors except in compassionate care situations , preventing non - essential personnel from entering the building , and strengthening infection prevention and control guidance and adherence , including social distancing . 14 Roxby et al . have recently shown that adherence to strict hygiene and social distancing strategies leads to a low prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 detection among residents and staff in senior independent / assisted living communities . 11 Isolation policies are more controversial and still a matter of discussion . 15 It has been suggested that residents should not be isolated from their loved ones for a long time not only in order to support their social well - being and avoid loneliness , but also because friends and family members often help to provide essential care for residents . 15 Unfortunately , the questionnaire did not specifically address the issue of psycho - physical well - being of residents . This is for sure an important limitation of the present study . Our experience with the Cesare e Emilio Prandoni Onlus suggests that the rigorous application of isolation procedures ( that is to close access to visitors including family members ) , the strict use of PPE by staff members when working and in their everyday life , and correct hand hygiene can effectively prevent a population at high risk of mortality ( residents in northern Italy with a mean age of 90 years and highly frequent co - morbidities ) from becoming infected with SARS - CoV - 2 in the short - term . Indeed , SARS - CoV - 2 antibody testing , done three months after the widespread diffusion of COVID - 19 in Italy , was negative in 100 % of the residents . Remarkably , the mortality - 9 - rate during the study period was totally superimposable with that observed in the previous two years ; and none of staff members developed COVID - 19 . According to the results of our survey , 50 % and 84 % of the staff members said , respectively , they had attended a training course on the use of PPE and have a good / excellent knowledge on these procedures . This apparent discrepancy may be related to the lack of provision of objective criteria to score the knowledge of PPE . On the other hands , overall these data could be read as reassuring on the high quality of expertise of the staff members . The picture was completely different during the second COVID - 19 pandemic wave observed in autumn 2020 . Despite the assisted living facility has maintained the same procedures containment systems applied successfully during the first pandemic wave , as well as fortnightly control of the molecular swab for SARS - CoV - 2 for staff members and residents due to the increase of people tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 in the province of Como and in the city of Torno , the structure was heavily affected by an COVID - 19 outbreak . Indeed , 39 % of staff members and 94 % of residents resulted positive to the molecular swab tests . The outbreak is likely to be caused by a healthcare worker who was most likely infected by her children ( then tested positive ) and who was in charge of washing the patients during the asymptomatic phase of the disease ( she subsequently developed fever and cough ) . Accordingly , we hypothesized that the difference with the first pandemic wave was related , at least in part , to the non - closure of the schools in autumn 2020 , which allowed the spread of the virus in families of staff members . The role of children in the transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 infection is still a matter of active debate , with data showing that such risk is low but not absent . 16 - 19 Similarly , preliminary evidence is also available showing that schools re - opening can favor the spread of SARS - CoV - 2 infection . 20 - 23 Indeed , in Italy the schools closed in March 2020 and did not re - open until September 2020 . Finally , the difficulty in keeping the PPEs inside their homes when in contact with close family members should also be considered . Ideally the use of PPE in daily life should be implemented not - 10 - only by health care workers but also by all family members . This is , however , a very difficult task to be accomplished in real life , especially in the long term . During the second COVID - 19 pandemic wave , we observed a 5 - fold increase in the proportion of citizen of the province of Como tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 infection ( from 0 . 7 to 3 . 8 % ) . Accordingly , the possibility that the higher prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection outside the facility could have impacted significantly on the prevalence of the disease in the facility cannot be ruled out . Indeed , Gorges and Konetza have recently shown that the strongest predictor of COVID - 19 cases and outbreaks in nursing homes is per capita cases in the county . 24 In the same study the Authors documented that higher nurse aide hours and total nursing hours contained the cases and deaths . Evidence is also available showing that adherence to infection prevention and control ( IPC ) restrictive measures decreases over time . 25 , 26 Unfortunately , no information was available on the adherence of the staff members ( and their families ) to the IPC rules during the second COVID - 19 pandemic wave . Hence , we cannot exclude that the different outcome between the two pandemic waves was related , at least in part , to suboptimal adherence to IPC . 5 . CONCLUSIONS Our experience suggests that the prompt application of restrictive procedures can eventually prevent the spread and progression of disease in assisted living facilities even in the presence of life - threatening pandemic SARS - CoV - 2 infection in the short - term , but may fail in the long term , especially when the prevalence of the COVID - 19 greatly increased outside the facility enhancing the risk of import the disease from outside . Vaccination is important to control outbreaks and spread of SARS CoV2 , but use of PPE and social distances remain important . Vaccination is not a guarantee but will contribute to control / limit the prevalence and spread of the virus . 27 . - 11 - Credit authorship contribution statement Mario Tagliabue : Conceptualization , formal analysis , review and editing Anna Lisa Ridolfo : Conceptualization , review and editing Paolo Pina : Conceptualization , review and editing Giuseppe Rizzolo : Conceptualization , review and editing Sonia Belbusti : Conceptualization , review and editing Spinello Antinori : Conceptualization , review and editing Martina Beltrami : formal analysis and review Dario Cattaneo : Conceptualization , formal analysis , writing first draft Cristina Gervasoni : Conceptualization , formal analysis , writing first draft Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest in relation to this article - 12 - REFERENCES 1 .
