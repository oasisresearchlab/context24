V . 2007 Abstract Talin is a large dimeric 270 kDa adapter protein which binds the cytoplasmic face of a subset of integrin b - subunits and couples them to the actin cytoskeleton . Here we report the near complete 15 N , 13 C and 1 H chemical shift assignments for the C - terminal actin - binding domain . Keywords Talin (cid:1) Integrin (cid:1) Actin (cid:1) Cell – matrix adhesion (cid:1) Actin binding domain Biological context Cellular interactions with the extracellular matrix are mod - ulated via dynamic protein complexes associated with the cytoplasmic face of the integrin family of cell adhesion molecules . Talin is one of a number of cytoskeletal proteins including a - actinin , ﬁlamin , tensin and ILK implicated in linking members of the integrin family of ab - heterodimeric cell adhesion molecules to F - actin ( see Critchley 2000 for review ) . It is large ( 2541 amino acids ) elongated ( 50 – 60 nm ) protein composed of a globular head ( residues 1 – 400 ) con - taining a FERM domain linked to a ﬂexible rod ( residues 482 – 2541 ) by a short linker sequence . The FERM F3 sub - domain contains a binding site for the b - integrin cytoplasmic domain , and recent structural studies have provided a detailed understanding of how F3 recognises both the NP 9 Y motif and membrane proximal sequences within the b - integrin cytodomain ( Wegener et al . 2007 ) . The talin rod is made up of a series of amphipathic helical bundles , a number of which contain binding sites for the cytoskeletal protein vinculin which is thought to stabilise focal adhe - sions , possibly by cross - linking talin to F - actin . The C - terminal region of talin ( residues 2300 – 2541 ) contains the major binding site for F - actin ( Hemmings et al . 1996 ) that is homologous to that in the yeast protein Slap2 and the Hun - tingtin interacting protein HIP1 , and the related protein Hip1R . This highly conserved domain has been referred to as an I / LWEQ motif ( McCann and Craig 1997 ) or more recently the THATCH ( talin - Hip1 / R / Sla2p actin tethering C - terminal homology ) core domain ( Brett et al . 2006 ) . Methods and experiments Multiple polypeptides corresponding to different C - terminal fragments of talin were made and expressed in E . coli BL21 Star ( DE3 ) cultured in M9 minimal media , using 15 N - ammonium chloride . The recombinant His - tagged protein was puriﬁed by nickel - afﬁnity chromatography and eluted by an imidazole gradient . The His - tag was removed by cleavage with TEV protease prior to further puriﬁcation by anion - exchange chromatography . NMR samples of [ 15 N , 13 C ] - labeled C - terminal actin - binding domain were prepared at 1 mM in 20 mM sodium phosphate , 50 mM NaCl , 2 mM DTT , pH 6 . 0 and 10 % v / v D 2 O . Comparison of the NMR spectra of the different C - terminal fragments of talin that contain the actin binding domain led to identiﬁcation of a minimal region ( residues 2300 – 2482 ) that incorporates the complete domain . Extension of the sequence at the N - or C - terminus added unstructured regions to the protein , while truncation B . T . Goult (cid:1) A . R . Gingras (cid:1) N . Bate (cid:1) G . C . K .

NMR and CD anal - ysis demonstrated exceptionally high thermal stability of the domain with the melting temperature of * 90 (cid:2) C . This construct was then expressed and puriﬁed as before , but in M9 ( minimal media , using 15 N - ammonium chloride and 13 C - glucose . NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker AVANCE DRX 600 spectrometer and an AVANCE DRX 800 equipped with CryoProbes . Due to the high thermal stability of the domain it was possible to use elevated temperatures and the experiments described here were all performed at 45 (cid:2) C . Proton chemical shifts were referenced to external DSS . The 15 N and 13 C chemical shifts were referenced indirectly using recommended gyromagnetic ratios ( Wishart et al . 1995 ) . Spectra were processed with TopSpin ( Bruker ) and analysed using CCPN Analysis ( Vranken et al . 2005 ) . 3D HNCO , HN ( CA ) CO , HNCA , HN ( CO ) CA , HNCACB and HN ( CO ) CACB experiments were used for the sequential assignment of the backbone NH , N , CO , C a and C b resonances . Side chain assignments were obtained using 3D HBHA ( CO ) NH , HBHANH , H ( C ) CH - TOCSY and ( H ) CCH - TOCSY experiments . Aromatic side chain assignments were obtained using 13 C - resolved 3D NOESY - HSQC . Resonance assignment reported here and secondary structure analysis show that the actin - binding domain is composed of ﬁve helices of 22 – 33 residues long ( regions T2302 – Q2325 , F2341 – Q2373 , A2383 – Q2416 , S2420 – V2444 and E2451 – K2476 ) some which are connected by long unstructured loops . Extent of assignments and data deposition Backbone HN , N , CO , C a and C b resonances have been completely assigned . Assignments for non - exchangeable protonated side - chain groups are essentially complete ( 99 . 9 % ) with the exception of serine 2427 where the side chain could not be assigned due to signal overlap . The assigned [ 1 H , 15 N ] - HSQC spectrum is shown in Fig . 1 . Resonance assignments have been submitted in the BioMagResBank ( http : / / www . bmrb . wisc . edu / ) with the accession number 15411 . The assignments of the actin binding domain of talin reported here complement depos - ited resonance assignments for other talin domains : VBS2 domain from the talin rod ( residues 755 – 889 , accession number 6582 ) , a spacer domain from the talin rod ( residues 1655 – 1822 , accession number 15457 ) , and F3 subdomain of the talin head ( residues 304 – 405 , accession numbers 7061 and 7150 ) .
