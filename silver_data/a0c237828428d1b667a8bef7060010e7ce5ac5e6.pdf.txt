The low - cost submersible devices must not disturb surface use of waterways while producing between 20 and 100 watts of power for river currents between 1 and 3 m / s . These hydro - kinetic power systems must be tested in a full range of water flow velocities . Local river testing does not readily provide a wide range of flow velocities and commercially available water tunnels are infeasible for this application , starting at $ 14 , 000 for a model with a maximum flow velocity of 0 . 3 m / s and a 70 in 2 test cross - section , much less than the 400 in 2 test cross - section needed . This paper describes the conversion of a pre - existing 24 foot diameter 4 foot deep above - ground pool into a variable flow - rate “water tunnel” facility using $ 500 of additional equipment . Steady state flow rates of 0 . 89 m / s are achieved using an 80 pound thrust ( rated ) trolling motor powered by a pulse - width - modulated motor controller drawing approximately 970 W of electrical power . Calculations indicate that approximately 400 pounds of rated thrust will be required to reach our goal of 2 . 0 m / s flow rates near the outer edge of our pool river simulator . 1 Introduction and Motivation 1 . 1 Global Service Learning Many engineering schools involve students in global service - learning projects 1 , 2 , 3 . The importance of integrating both global impacts and social impacts into the engineering curriculum is acknowledged by the ABET criteria 4 , and human need is a clear priority of the engineering profession , as indicated in the NSPE creed * , 5 . The majority of North American engineering students , however , are not familiar with the contexts in which vast needs exist , such as those among the physically disabled or among the estimated 4 billion people living on less than $ 2 a day ( purchasing power parity ) 6 . Integration of hydro - kinetic energy projects into senior design and thermodynamics courses exposes students to the growing field of renewable energy , as well as supports the emphasis LeTourneau University places on global service due to the potential of small - scale hydro - kinetic technologies for use in remote areas . 1 . 2 The Need for a 100W Hydro - Kinetic Generator Electric power is a major quality of life enabler through technologies such as lighting , communications , and digital electronics . From a global perspective , many remote areas have either unreliable electrical power or no power at all 7 . HCJB Global , an international humanitarian organization , requested a student team to design , prototype , and test a system to provide ~ 2 . 4kW - hr / day ( before storage ) of electrical power to remote areas , from a river with no dams or other significant elevation change . Creating a remote power module with minimal site * “As a Professional Engineer , I dedicate my professional knowledge and skill to the advancement and betterment of human welfare …” works ( e . g . no dams ) could empower HCJB Global to fulfill their humanitarian objectives in several capacities in remote areas . Figure 1 shows a 100W hydro - kinetic device which harnesses the kinetic energy of flowing water , commercially available for ~ $ 1200 . Such technologies appear promising in certain remote contexts unfriendly to fossil fuel generators ( due to fuel cost and maintenance ) , solar photovoltaic ( due to low sunlight or trees ) , and potential - energy hydro ( if dams and diversions are problematic , for example . ) A low - power hydro - kinetic technology that is easily transported and installed is attractive for a number of the remote locations where HCJB global works . The feasibility is extremely sensitive to the available river velocity since power density ( V 3 / 2 kW / m ^ 2 ) is proportional to the cube of river velocity . Figure 1 : Sample 100W Hydro - kinetic Electricity Generator ( Ampair UW100 * ) 1 . 3 Hydro - Kinetic Testing Alternatives and the Need for a Low - Cost “Water - Tunnel” Feasibility evaluation of a low - power hydro - kinetic technology requires data for power produced in various river velocities . Several testing options considered were not pursued due to feasibility concerns : ( 1 ) a swimmer’s treadmill ( continuously flowing swimming pool ) had too small of a flowing cross - section , ( 2 ) the cooling water outlet from a local power plant may have been too difficult to access due to post - 9 / 11 security concerns and too turbulent , ( 3 ) inducing flow with an outboard motor in a large oval - shaped ditch of water was deemed to require too much land and power , and ( 4 ) a cursory search indicated commercially available water tunnels start at $ 14 , 000 for a model with a maximum flow velocity of 0 . 3 m / s and a 70 in 2 test cross - section , much slower and smaller than the 400 in 2 test cross - section needed . Testing options which were used by students include pulling the hydro - kinetic device from a boat ( in which the wake is a challenge ) , anchoring in a natural river as in Figure 2 ( which offers no speed control but provided some good data from 0 . 7 - 0 . 9m / s ) , and pulling from land ( which is limited to short tests but allows speed control ) . Testing anchored in a river provided the most realistic and long - term testing ( including debris and flood stages ) with the disadvantages of no control over flow speed and difficulty with site access and setup . Pulling from land proved conducive to rapidly testing multiple configurations across a variety of water speeds . * http : / / www . boost - energy . com / ampair / products _ product5 . asp The river simulator is under development in hopes of obtaining a variable - speed velocity with long run time in a highly accessible and controlled environment . Figure 2 : River Testing 2 Prototype River Simulator and Sensor Systems A hydro - kinetic testing setup requires relative velocity between water and the test device , and a calibrated velocity sensor . The prototype river simulator reported here is based on a 24 foot diameter , 4 - foot deep above - ground swimming pool . Similar pools are available new for $ 1 , 000 - $ 2 , 000 . The entire body of water is caused to rotate using a Minn Kota 24V trolling motor assembly ( Figure 3 ) rated at 80 pounds of thrust that was donated to the project by East Texas Sonar of Longview , Texas . Figure 3 : 24V Trolling Motor 2 . 2 Electrical Power Systems Power to the trolling motor was supplied by a Mean Well SE - 1000 - 24 regulated power supply rated at 24V and 41 . 7A and powered by 110V AC grid power . For some of the tests , the power supply was connected directly to the trolling motor . In these cases , the trolling motor drew more than 50 amps of current from the power supply , exceeding its rating , causing shutdown on a thermal overload . Additional tests were run using a Kelly KDS36100 pulse width modulated motor controller , powered by the Mean Well described above . The motor controller is rated at 24 - 36V up to 100 amps . The final electrical system used is shown in Figure 4 . An electrical schematic is shown in Figure 5 ( in which the “battery” shown is replaced with the Mean Well supplied with 110V grid power . ) It was observed that the power supply would shut down due to thermal overload after approximately one hour when run between 40 and 50 amps . The system may be able to run longer if less power is drawn from the supply . Figure 4 : Trolling Motor and Kelly Power System Figure 5 : Schematic for Trolling Motor Power System ( the “battery” shown is replaced with the Mean Well power supply , supplied with 110V grid power ) 2 . 3 Vortex Suppression A 55 gallon barrel was placed in the center of the pool in hopes of reducing the potentially damaging ( energy - draining ) effects of vortex formation . Figure 6 shows the method for centering the barrel – not a trivial assignment on a cold December day . Figure 6 : 24ft Pool and Vortex Suppression Barrel Being Centered 2 . 4 Velocity Sensor Positioning System A sensor positioning system was designed to achieve both rigidity and accurate radial and vertical positioning as shown in Figure 7 . 2 . 5 Velocity Sensors Three types of velocity sensors were used to characterize the river simulator : a floating ball ( $ 1 ) , an educational - grade Vernier sensor ( $ 129 + $ 61 ) and a professional - grade Swoffer ( $ 316 ) coupled with a custom - built logging circuit . Cost can be a major obstacle to student projects , so all three sensors are described here . 2 . 5 . 1 Timing a Floating Ball Timing a floating ball circling the pool was used to estimate surface velocity both before velocity sensors were available on site and as a reality check later . This turned out to be important when electronic velocity measurements appeared to be twice the value of the ball , and the erroneous factor of 2 was quickly discovered . The floating ball also offered the benefit of illustrating surface particle path . With the pool running at top speed the ball test took 21 - 22 seconds to make one circumference of the pool at approximately ( 2 + / - 1 ) foot from the outer edge of the pool . This gives a velocity estimate of 0 . 9 + / - 0 . 1 m / s . Figure 7 : Velocity Sensor Positioning System ( Radial and Vertical ) 2 . 5 . 2 Vernier 8 Velocity Sensor The Vernier “Flow Rate Sensor 8 ” lists for $ 129 and requires either a $ 61 dollar electronic link to a computer or a $ 329 stand - alone data logger . This sensor uses a magnet rotated by a propeller to trigger a reed switch , and converts these pulses to a measurable voltage proportional to water velocity . The authors had difficulty obtaining repeatable results with this sensor , and it had the added disadvantage of having no method for recalibration . The authors have had good experience with Vernier sensors in the past , but at this time would not conclusively recommend this particular flow rate sensor for scientific work . The Vernier manual states the sensor is intended for educational purposes only , and not research . 2 . 5 . 3 Swoffer 9 Velocity Sensor Our testing used a professional - grade $ 316 Swoffer 9 sensor ( Figure 8 ) which gates a beam of infrared light through a bundle of fiber optics back to a photo - transistor . This high - quality rotor is normally part of a larger bundle including a data logger , which was outside of the project budget ( $ 1 , 600 to $ 2 , 800 ) . Instead , a student - built counter which displayed the number of pulses in binary ( Figure 9 ) allowed use of the rotor along with a stopwatch at the expense of some data logging inconvenience . Figure 10 shows the Swoffer in action – made possible by a partially submerged transparent pie dish which gave a glass - bottom - boat effect by overcoming surface ripples . This visibility enhancing trick made it much easier to spot and remove the occasional leaf attached to the sensor . Figure 8 : Swoffer Velocity Sensor Rotor * Figure 9 : Custom Built Low - Cost Reader for the Swoffer Velocity Sensor Figure 10 : Swoffer Velocity Sensor in Action ( Underneath a Semi - submersed Pie Dish for Visibility ) * http : / / www . swoffer . com / img / rotor % 20parts . jpg 2 . 5 . 4 Swoffer Velocity Sensor Calibration The custom circuit ( Figure 9 ) displays the cumulative pulses produced by the Swoffer sensor via LED’s . Figure 11 shows calibration data obtained by walking the sensor 18 . 9m through a still indoor swimming pool at different average velocities . The calibration tests indicate that the sensor consistently produces 45 . 5 pulses / meter independent of velocity . In experimental testing this calibration number is used to convert sensor pulses into a distance of water passing over the sensor , and this distance divided by time gives water velocity in m / s . Figure 11 : Swoffer Sensor Calibration Graph Showing 45 . 5 pulses / meter 3 River Simulator Testing Procedures and Data Analysis 3 . 1 Velocity Profile Figure 12 shows the one - dimensional velocity profile obtained with the professional - grade Swoffer sensor and rigid support shown previously in Figure 8 and Figure 7 respectively . Each data point is an average velocity sampled over 7s to 25s . At the end of testing the first data point was repeated multiple times to insure repeatability . As expected , the graph shows a linear relationship between pool radius and water velocity . The trend line indicates that the velocity would be zero approximately 10 . 7ft from the pool edge , which is near the outer edge of the vortex - reducing barrel in the center . This indicates a 2 foot diameter hydro - kinetic device in these testing conditions would experience a velocity difference of 0 . 2 m / s from edge - to - edge . An accidental failure of the power electronics delayed additional data collection past the publication date for this paper . During these tests the trolling motor was measured to draw 23V * 42A = 966W . 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 0 . 00 0 . 50 1 . 00 1 . 50 2 . 00 P u l s e / m Calibration Test Velocity ( m / s ) Swoffer Pulse / m vs . Calibration Test Velocity ( 18 . 9m distance in nearly still pool ) Figure 12 : One - dimensional Velocity Profile ( 1ft Below Surface ) ( 24 Foot Diameter Pool , Single Motor Drawing 23V & 42A ) 3 . 2 Spin - Down and Spin - Up Data Based on the velocity profile data ( Figure 12 ) the pool can be treated like a rigid disk such that velocity of each particle is proportional to the distance from the center of the pool and angular velocity is uniform in the pool . The total mass of the pool ( 12 foot radius , 42 inch water level ) was calculated to be about 45 , 000 kg . The moment of inertia for the pool was calculated as 301 , 000 kg - m 2 . For the spin - down and spin - up data presented in Figure 13 and Figure 14 , velocity measurements were taken at a 2 foot distance from the outer edge ( 10 foot radius from the center . ) The shape of the velocity versus time graph during spin - down ( Figure 13 ) can tell us about the dissipative forces on the spinning water . The assumption was made that any dissipative torques on the pool would be proportional to angular velocity squared . This results in the left - hand - side equation below : moment of inertia ( I ) times angular acceleration ( α ) = the drag coefficient ( β ) times angular velocity ( ω ) squared . ( This equation is analogous to ∑ F = ma , but for rotating rigid bodies is rather ∑τ = I α , with the order reversed below . ) This leads to a differential equation which has an analytical solution ( obtained in this case via WolframAlpha 10 online ) for angular velocity as a function of time , shown in the right - hand - side equation below . (cid:1835)(cid:2009) (cid:3404) (cid:3398)(cid:2010)(cid:2033) (cid:2870) → (cid:2033)(cid:4666)(cid:1872)(cid:4667) (cid:3404) (cid:1835)(cid:2033) (cid:2868) (cid:1835) (cid:3397) (cid:2010)(cid:2033) (cid:2868) (cid:1872) This function was fit to our data with β as a free parameter . The quality of the curve fit to the data suggests that the model for dissipative forces is accurate . The best fit value gave β = 6 , 740 kg - m 2 .

Radial Position Figure 13 : Spin - Down : water velocity at a 10 foot radius as a function of time while the pool was slowing down after power was removed from the trolling motor . The solid line is a best fit curve assuming drag forces which are proportional to velocity squared . Figure 14 : Spin - Up : water velocity at a 10 foot radius as a function of time while the pool was speeding up when power was first applied to the trolling motor . The solid line is a best fit curve assuming constant thrust from the trolling motor , and drag forces which are proportional to velocity squared . The shape of the velocity versus time graph during spin - up ( Figure 14 ) along with our knowledge of the dissipative forces can tell us about the effect of the trolling motor on the water . The assumption was made that the trolling motor provides constant thrust to the water at a fixed radius . This leads to the differential equation below which has an analytical solution for angular velocity as a function of time . ( Here r trolling is the distance of the trolling motor from the center of the pool . ) (cid:1835)(cid:2009) (cid:3404) (cid:4666)(cid:1832) (cid:3047)(cid:3045)(cid:3042)(cid:3039)(cid:3039)(cid:3036)(cid:3041)(cid:3034) (cid:4667)(cid:4666)(cid:1870) (cid:3047)(cid:3045)(cid:3042)(cid:3039)(cid:3039)(cid:3036)(cid:3041)(cid:3034) (cid:4667) (cid:3398) (cid:2010)(cid:2033) (cid:2870) → (cid:2033)(cid:4666)(cid:1872)(cid:4667) (cid:3404) (cid:3496)(cid:4666)(cid:1832) (cid:3047)(cid:3045)(cid:3042)(cid:3039)(cid:3039)(cid:3036)(cid:3041)(cid:3034) (cid:4667)(cid:4666)(cid:1870) (cid:3047)(cid:3045)(cid:3042)(cid:3039)(cid:3039)(cid:3036)(cid:3041)(cid:3034) (cid:4667) (cid:2010) (cid:1872)(cid:1853)(cid:1866)(cid:1860) (cid:4678)(cid:3493)(cid:4666)(cid:1832) (cid:3047)(cid:3045)(cid:3042)(cid:3039)(cid:3039)(cid:3036)(cid:3041)(cid:3034) (cid:4667)(cid:4666)(cid:1870) (cid:3047)(cid:3045)(cid:3042)(cid:3039)(cid:3039)(cid:3036)(cid:3041)(cid:3034) (cid:4667)(cid:2010) (cid:1835) (cid:1872)(cid:4679) This function was fit to our data with F trolling as a free parameter ( β was fixed from the previous fit ) . The quality of the curve fit to the data suggests that the model of constant thrust force from the trolling motor is reasonable , although a close inspection reveals that the thrust is higher when the pool is spinning slower . The best fit value gave a trolling motor thrust of 190 Newtons ( 43 pounds ) or a little more than half of the rated thrust for the trolling motor . These data allow us to calculate the power input to the pool by the trolling motor at the maximum water speed ( 165 W ) and the total kinetic energy of the pool at the maximum water speed ( 13 , 000 J ) . We can see that in order to increase the final water speed to 2 . 0 m / s ( at a 10 foot radius ) , we will need to increase the effective thrust from 190 Newtons to 980 Newtons ( 220 pounds ) , a little over 5 times the current thrust . The rated thrust will probably need to exceed 400 pounds – outside the range available in a single trolling motor . 4 Sample Student Project Testing Figure 15 shows the physical testing setup with a 24V trolling motor to drive the water flow , and a 36V trolling motor re - purposed as a generator and fit with a custom blade . Figure 15 : River Simulator Hydro - kinetic Testing Setup Figure 16 shows the fabrication of a 6 inch pitch 24 inch diameter blade ; students are heating the blades to enable bending the correct pitch angle . Maintaining a constant 6in pitch requires the angle of each blade to decrease as the radial distance from the hub increases , requiring care in manufacturing . Figure 17 shows the new blade design undergoing testing in the river simulator . The data measured during testing indicated peak power of 0 . 16W despite a relatively large total incident power ( 18W calculated from P = 0 . 5 ρ ·Area·V 3 ) . This inefficiency was due to spinning the generator far too slowly for efficient electricity generation . Additionally , it was found that the large blade removed sufficient power from the pool to slow the maximum river simulator velocity from 0 . 89 m / s to 0 . 55 m / s . Although the testing results were disappointing from a 24V Drive Motor 36V Test ‘Generator’ Barrel Water Flow device standpoint ( ~ 1 % total system efficiency or η sys = 0 . 16W / 18W ) , multiple learning outcomes were achieved related to power and energy conversions and some basic elements of renewable energy technologies . Figure 16 : Fabrication of a New Blade Design for Hydro - kinetic Testing ( Heating Blades to Bend Pitch Angle ) Figure 17 : Testing a New Blade Design 5 Conclusions and Future Work Testing shows that a low - cost river simulator is both do - able and more complex than originally anticipated . The primary issue is providing adequate power to the water to reach a wider range of speeds ( the local river is 0 . 7 - 1 . 0 m / s at normal stage , and other rivers can run much faster . ) Since thrust input requirements scale with the square of water velocity , higher speeds will require a significantly larger power source , probably an outboard motor . Future work involves more thorough velocity profiling , testing for turbulence with dye , reducing water drag , measuring the effect of various sizes ( or the absence ) of a vortex reducer , and testing the effects of flow straighteners .
