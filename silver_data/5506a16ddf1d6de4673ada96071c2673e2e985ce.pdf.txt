Geographic , racial - ethnic , age and socioeconomic disparities in mortality have been key features of the ﬁrst and 4 second wave of the U . S . COVID - 19 epidemic . 1 – 5 However , the extent to which this differential mortality is driven 5 by evident disparities in rates of infection by age , race , and socioeconomic status , or some combination thereof , 6 remains unknown . Addressing the clear inequities in the toll of death resulting from the COVID - 19 pandemic in the 7 U . S . requires disaggregating the relative role of exposure leading to infection versus age - speciﬁc case - fatality rates 8 in drivers of the gaping inequity characteristic of SARS - CoV - 2 mortality in the United States . 9 Earlier analyses of other respiratory viruses , such as RSV and inﬂuenza , have documented race - ethnic disparities in 10 both rates of infection and case - fatality . 6 This inequality is driven by diverse factors including comorbid conditions 11 that increase susceptibility to infection as well as disease severity . But it is also a function of structural factors that 12 impact the ability of different groups to avoid infection . Relevant factors include mass incarceration , 7 , 8 residential 13 segregation 9 , 10 and wealth inequality that facilitates social distancing among the well - off while poorer individuals 14 are more likely to be compelled into ‘essential work’ . 11 A recent cross - national systematic review placed the average 15 infection fatality ratio ( IFR ) of COVID - 19 infection at 0 . 75 % . 12 However , population age structure is key to shaping 16 the crude mortality rate and total number of deaths from the pandemic , and age - speciﬁc variation in the prevalence 17 of underlying conditions is likely to have a dramatic impact on age - speciﬁc patterns of mortality . 13 While some stud - 18 ies have illustrated the differential impact of SARS - CoV - 2 on non - White populations in the U . S . using aggregated 19 data , 5 there are no analyses that provide a clear breakdown of these risks by age , sex , and race . 14 In the current 20 analysis , we aim to partially close this gap by analyzing patterns of age , sex , and race - speciﬁc SARS - CoV - 2 infection 21 and mortality using detailed case - level data from the U . S . state of Michigan , which was particularly hard - hit in by 22 SARS - CoV - 2 in the winter and spring of 2020 , and where the epidemic has been marked by unmistakable racial and 23 socioeconomic iequality . 24 Data 25 We used data from 73 , 441 people with conﬁrmed and probable COVID - 19 infections from the Michigan Disease 26 Surveillance System ( MDSS ) from March 8 th , 2020 through July 5 th , 2020 . Each case in MDSS is tagged with a unique 27 identiﬁer , sex at birth , age , race , the date their case was referred to MDHHS , whether the individual died , and the 28 date of death . In order to mitigate the impact of right censored deaths on our case - fatality rate estimates , 15 we 29 truncated the data at the 97 . 5 % quantile of time to death from case referral date , or forty - six days . This results in 30 truncating all data with a case referral date later than May 20 th , 2020 , after which our data comprise 58 , 428 individ - 31 uals . 32 From this dataset , we excluded 25 cases that did not reside in Michigan or were missing a state of residence , 8 , 613 33 people for whom race or ethnicity was not recorded , and 27 people who did not have age recorded or had age 34 > 116 years old indicating entry errors . We combined 68 pairs of records that had duplicate patient identiﬁcation 35 numbers , resulting in 34 fewer cases . Finally , we dropped 28 patients whose sex at birth was unknown , leading to a 36 ﬁnal dataset of 49 , 701 people with a conﬁrmed or probable COVID - 19 infection , with known age , race or ethnicity , 37 state of residence , sex at birth , and state prisoner status . 38 After ﬁltering the individual - level MDSS case data , we binned age by 10 year intervals to age 80 , while we combined 39 ages 80 and above in one bin . We also created the race / ethnicity categories of Black / African American , Latino , 40 Asian / Paciﬁc Islander , Native American , Other , and White , where Other comprised the census category of ‘other’ , 41 and mixed race people . In order to model per - capita rates of disease we used tract - level population data from the 42 2010 U . S . Census aggregated to the state level for Michigan to deﬁne the population in each age - sex - race stratum . 43 Methods 44 COVID - 19 cumulative indidence rates . To calculate age - speciﬁc rates of COVID - 19 infection in each age ( 𝑖 ) , sex 45 ( 𝑗 ) , race ( 𝑘 ) bin , per 100 , 000 population , we ﬁt a poisson regression model with a population offset term , 𝑙𝑜𝑔 ( 𝑛 𝑖𝑗𝑘 ) , 46 where 𝑛 𝑖𝑗𝑘 is the size of the population for the 𝑖𝑗𝑘 - th group from the 2010 U . S . Census . We included age x sex , age 47 x race , and sex x race interaction terms to capture the full spectrum of potential heterogeneity in our outcome data . 48 2 .

Age - speciﬁc case fatality rates ( CFR ) were estimated by ﬁtting a binomial model to the number 51 of deaths ( 𝑧 𝑖𝑗𝑘 ) as a proportion of the number of total cases ( 𝑦 𝑖𝑗𝑘 ) in each age / sex / race bin . We denote the CFR for 52 each group as 𝜌 𝑖𝑗𝑘 , so , 𝑧 𝑖𝑗𝑘 ∼ Binomial ( 𝑦 𝑖𝑗𝑘 , 𝜌 𝑖𝑗𝑘 ) . For all analyses of per - capita age - speciﬁc incidence rates , we 53 used a log - Gaussian prior distribution with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 0 . 1 . 54 Age and sex standardization . To characterize racial disparities unrelated to differences in population age struc - 55 ture or sex ratios , we employed a post - stratiﬁcation approach to direct standardization . Speciﬁcally , we generated 56 weights for each age x sex bin in the data , using the marginal age and sex distribution for the state of Michigan . We 57 then weighted posterior draws from the incidence and case - fatality models described above to generate adjusted 58 estimates . Age - adjusted case - fatality ratios ( CFRs ) in our results characterize the ratio in the overall risk of death if 59 individuals in the population were infected at a rate proportional to the share of the total population in their same 60 age / sex bin statewide . 61 Software . All analyses were completed in R 3 . 6 . 3 , using the rstanarm package 16 for Bayesian regression analysis , the 62 tidybayes package for post - processing 17 and ggplot2 for visualization . 18 63 Results 64 In our dataset , there are 49 , 701 probable and conﬁrmed COVID - 19 cases , and 5 , 815 deaths attributable to COVID - 65 19 , for an overall case - fatality rate of 12 % . Of these , 19 , 662 were among individuals identiﬁed as Black or African - 66 American , 23 , 301 were among individuals identiﬁed as White , 1 , 346 among individuals identiﬁed as Asian or Paciﬁc 67 Islander , 123 among individuals identiﬁed as Native American , and 1 , 612 among individuals identiﬁed as belonging 68 to any other racial / ethnic group in the 2010 U . S . Census . 69 Table 1 shows per - capita case and mortality rates by race / ethnic group , as well as corresponding case - fatality rates . 70 Notably , the raw incidence rate among all non - White groups is substantially higher than among Whites for all groups 71 identiﬁed in the data except for Native Americans . However , the overall case - fatality rate for Whites is on par with 72 the case - fatality rate for blacks , potentially owing to different distributions of ages among cases and deaths between 73 these groups . Among Whites , the average age of all reported cases was 53 . 4 yrs ( 53 . 2 , 53 . 7 ) , slightly older than among 74 blacks , 51 . 4 yrs ( 51 . 1 , 51 . 6 ) , and signiﬁcantly older than among Latinos , 38 . 1 yrs ( 37 . 6 , 38 . 6 ) and those in the “other” 75 race / ethnicity group . For all groups , the mean age among individuals with COVID - 19 listed as their cause of death 76 was signiﬁcantly higher than for all cases within the same group . Among Whites , the average age at death was the 77 greatest , at 79 . 2 yrs ( 78 . 6 , 79 . 9 ) , eight years higher than among Blacks at 71 . 2 yrs ( 70 . 5 , 71 . 9 ) , with Latinos having the 78 youngest average age at death at 66 . 7 yrs ( 63 . 6 , 69 . 8 ) . Taken together , these results suggest that for Non - Whites other 79 than Native Americans , the risk of COVID - 19 infection was uniformly higher than for Whites . However , because 80 these groups have differing population age and sex distributions , standardization is necessary to ensure that these 81 reﬂect differences in risk rather than being a function of the distribution of population . 82 Standardized incidence and mortality rates . Table 2 shows age and sex - standardized incidence and mortality rates 83 per 100 , 000 population , and corresponding between - group rate ratios , by race / ethnic group . Rows of the table 84 are ordered by raw incidence per 100K individuals for comparability with Tables 1 . This shows that the general 85 patterns in the raw incidence and mortality hold after adjustment , although the age and sex - adjusted incidence 86 among Latinos falls signiﬁcantly , reﬂecting the younger average age of cases identiﬁed as Latino .

( which was not certified by peer review ) preprint The copyright holder for this this version posted September 11 , 2020 . . https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 2020 . 09 . 10 . 20192369 doi : medRxiv preprint incidence rate ratios ( IRRs ) and mortality rate ratios ( MRRs ) show the enormous disparity in incidence and mortality 88 between Blacks and Whites , with and IRR of nearly 6 and an MRR of nearly 7 . Again , these IRRs and MRRs reﬂect 89 the fact that all groups other than Native Americans had higher rates of incidence and mortality than whites and 90 that these differences do not simply reﬂect the age and sex distribution of cases . For Native Americans , rates were 91 statistically indistinguishable from those for Whites , although this may be due to the very small number of cases 92 and deaths overall in this group in our data . 93 Cumulative incidence rates . Figure 1 shows dramatically higher overall and age - speciﬁc incidence rates among 94 Blacks and individuals in the “Other” race / ethnic category than for whites , particularly at older ages at which 95 individuals are far more likely to die from their infection . In addition , the horizontal dashed line in each panel of 96 Figure 1 shows the raw incidence rate for each group , and then dotted line indicates the age - adjusted incidence rate . 97 The extent of these disparities in incidence is clearly in evidence in panel A of Figure 3 , which shows the ratio of 98 the age - speciﬁc cumulative incidence rate ( incidence rate ratio , IRR ) for each race / ethnic group as compared to the 99 comparable rate for Whites . In this case , rates for all non - White groups are signiﬁcantly higher , with these disparities 100 most pronounced at older ages for Blacks , and younger ages for latinos . The IRR for individuals in the ‘other’ group 101 was fairly consistent across ages , with a small drop in the 20 - 40 age range . 102 In the following sections , we will examine age - stratiﬁed incidence and mortality rates by race / ethnicity for Blacks , 103 Latinos , Asians / Paciﬁc Islanders and Whites . Native Americans are excluded from age - stratiﬁed analyses due to a 104 small sample size , as are individuals in the “Other” race / ethic categorization . 105 Case - fatality rates . Figure 2 illustrates the trend in case - fatality rates by age . These are fairly consistent between 106 groups , with a steadily increasing trend in the probability of death among identiﬁed cases from age 50 onwards , 107 although there are apparent differences in these rates at younger ages as well . These are clearly visible in panel B of 108 Figure 3 , which shows the ratio of the age - speciﬁc case - fatality ratio for Blacks , Latinos and those in the ‘other’ group 109 vs . the case - fatality rate for Whites of the same age . Because of the small number of deaths in individuals < 20 years of 110 age , these groups are excluded from the ﬁgure . For Blacks , all age groups from 30 to 70 years experience higher case - 111 fatality rates than Whites , with this disparity most pronounced in the 40 - 49 year age - group . However , for Latinos 112 and those in the ‘other’ race / ethnic group , there are no signiﬁcant differences in age - speciﬁc case - fatality rates as 113 compared to Whites . In Figs . 2 & 3 , the dashed line indicates raw case - fatality rates , while the dotted line indicates 114 an age - adjusted estimate of case - fatality assuming an equal probability of infection at all ages of the standardized 115 population . These results suggest that although there are meaningful differences in case - fatality by race and age , 116 that the large raw and standardized disparities in COVID - 19 mortality cannot be explained by case fatality rates 117 alone . 118 One way to understand the relative importance of exposure vs . case - fatality on the disparate burden of mortality 119 by race is to examine the counterfactual scenario in which each race / ethnic group has the age - and sex - speciﬁc 120 COVID - 19 incidence rate of the corresponding age / sex group among Whites but their original age - and sex - speciﬁc 121 case - fatality rates . When we do this , we ﬁnd that this would result in a decrease of 83 % , 95 % CI = ( 82 % , 84 % ) of 122 deaths among Blacks , 63 % , 95 % CI = ( 53 % , 72 % ) among Latinos , and 59 % , 95 % CI = ( 46 % , 69 % ) among Asian / Paciﬁc 123 Islanders . 124 These results suggest that while differential case - fatality rates can account for some of the disparity in Black vs . White 125 mortality rates , the large majority of COVID - 19 deaths among African - Americans in Michigan can be attributed to 126 the large differences in age - speciﬁc incidence illustrated in Fig 1 . Similarly , although Latinos and Asian / Paciﬁc 127 Race Incidence / 100K IRR Mortality / 100K MRR Black 1644 ( 1621 , 1668 ) 5 . 6 ( 5 . 5 , 5 . 7 ) 251 ( 242 , 262 ) 6 . 9 ( 6 . 5 , 7 . 3 ) Latino 1113 ( 1074 , 1152 ) 3 . 8 ( 3 . 7 , 3 . 9 ) 79 ( 66 , 94 ) 2 . 2 ( 1 . 8 , 2 . 6 ) Other 1520 ( 1442 , 1605 ) 5 . 2 ( 4 . 9 , 5 . 5 ) 152 ( 124 , 185 ) 4 . 2 ( 3 . 4 , 5 . 1 ) Asian / Paciﬁc Islander 695 ( 654 , 738 ) 2 . 4 ( 2 . 2 , 2 . 5 ) 79 ( 61 , 99 ) 2 . 2 ( 1 . 7 , 2 . 7 ) White 293 ( 289 , 296 ) Ref 36 ( 35 , 38 ) Ref Native American 254 ( 209 , 303 ) 0 . 9 ( 0 . 7 , 1 ) 26 ( 12 , 49 ) 0 . 7 ( 0 . 3 , 1 . 3 ) Table 2 : Age and sex - standardized incidence and mortality rates and corresponding rate ratios .

However , the age - standardized results in Table 2 suggest this is 131 unlikely to be the case . We also explicitly examined sex - speciﬁc differences in incidence , overall mortality and case - 132 fatality ( See Figure S1 in the supplementary materials ) , and found no meaningful differences by sex or race , although 133 the risk of death from COVID - 19 is signiﬁcantly higher for men than for women across all groups , echoing other 134 ﬁndings . 135 Discussion 136 Our results highlight yawning gaps in COVID - 19 incidence and mortality in Michigan that cannot be explained 137 away by differences in population age and sex composition . Our results also suggest that the stark differences in 138 crude and adjusted mortality between Blacks and all other race / ethnic groups shown in Tables 1 & 2 are driven in 139 large part by disparities in infection risk at all ages , and an extremely high rate of COVID - 19 infection among older 140 Blacks in particular . This group of individuals had a similar case - fatality rate to same - aged Whites , but reported 141 infection rates 6 - 8 times greater than among their White counterparts . Some of this disparity is also driven by the 142 higher case - fatality rate among middle - aged Blacks , as compared to same - aged Whites , in combination with the 5 - 6 143 times greater risk of infection among middle - aged African - Americans as compared to Whites . 144 Despite these unambiguous results , the full extent of racial and socioeconomic disparities in COVID - 19 outcomes in 145 Michigan and the rest of the U . S . is likely to be even wider than is reﬂected in administrative data of the type analyzed 146 here . Results from other hard - hit cities , states , and countries have indicated high rates of excess mortality reﬂective 147 of unrecognized and unreported COVID - 19 infection . 19 In a recent analysis using state - level data Weinberger et al . 20 148 estimated rates of excess mortality due to COVID - 19 . They found that there were approximately 4700 unreported 149 deaths likely due to COVID - 19 or another respiratory infection during the period from March 1 - May 30 2020 , for 150 a rate of 61 / 100 , 000 unreported deaths from COVID - 19 above the reported totals . Of course , the damage to health 151 from the pandemic is not only among infections and deaths from SARS - CoV - 2 : In other recent results , Woolf et 152 al . 21 showed that 33 % of the total excess deaths during the period from March 1 - April 25 2020 in Michigan were 153 attributable to non - infectious causes , with the remainder associated with respiratory infections , primarily COVID - 154 19 . Though these results are not broken down by race / ethnicity , it remains critically important to understand who is 155 among these unreported deaths from COVID - 19 as well as non - infectious illnesses . Beyond the delay in healthcare 156 seeking of all risk averse individuals , it is quite likely that these patterns of excess death reﬂect underlying disparities 157 in chronic illnesses that predispose individuals to mortality from COVID - 19 , lack of access to healthcare for Blacks , 158 Latinx individuals and other minority groups , and variable quality of care delivered based on racial - ethnic identity . 159 When interpreting these and other results illustrating racial disparities in COVID - 19 incidence and outcomes , it is 160 key to not examine race as a risk factor independent of health conditions , wealth and other potentially modiﬁable 161 risk factors 22 that may predispose individuals to COVID - 19 infection and mortality . For example , McClure et al . 23 162 illustrate how a focus on - and adjustment for - individual - level “underlying conditions” obscures the role of racial 163 inequality in shaping the prevalence of these chronic health conditions , and other factors such as intergenerational 164 households , which may increase risk among racial and ethnic minority groups . 165 A strength of our analysis is the use of detailed case data obtained directly from the Michigan Disease Surveillance 166 System . This allowed us to identify age and race - speciﬁc risks of COVID - 19 infection and death . Nonetheless , there 167 are some limitations that are important to highlight . First , our reliance on census - deﬁned race / ethnicity as a proxy 168 for exposure and mortality risk is necessarily reductive and does not shed enough light factors that can be modiﬁed to 169 reduce these disparities . Numerous studies have highlighted the role of wealth and other markers of socioeconomic 170 status ( SES ) such as educational attainment , as an important mediator of the effects of race on health outcomes . At the 171 same time , even after adjustment for SES , there is often a residual effect of race which cannot be explained solely in 172 terms of material wealth , and instead is likely accounted for by other factors including discrimination in healthcare 173 settings , and the impact of cumulative stress associated with exposure to structural racism . 24 Future analyses are 174 necessary using either prospectively collected data inclusive of SES , or spatial analyses that join neighborhood - level 175 information on wealth and other markers of SES with individual - level case data . 176 In addition , although the disparities in our data likely mirror many of those nationwide , it is important to remember 177 that these results reﬂect speciﬁcally patterns of infection and death in Michigan during the ﬁrst wave of the COVID - 178 19 pandemic in the U . S . Although its relatively large population size and socioeconomic and racial composition 179 8 .

Consequently , similar analyses 183 from these contexts are urgenly needed . 184 Another important limitation of our results is the reliance on racial categorizations from the 2010 census as well 185 as the documentation of race / ethnicity on case reports and death certiﬁcates . For example , the one exception to 186 the pattern of disparate risks among non - whites was the ﬁnding of no difference in incidence and mortality risk 187 for Native Americans in Michigan as compared to whites . These results may reﬂect the concerted effort to prevent 188 transmission in Native communities . 26 However , this may also reﬂect the fact that cases among American Indians 189 and Alaska Natives have disproportionately been categorized as occurring among the “Other” race / ethnic groups . 27 190 Other important groups are not included in census statistics . For example , there is a large Arab - American popula - 191 tion in Southeast Michigan , 28 who experience many social and medical vulnerabilities that may put them at increase 192 risk for COVID - 19 infection and death . 29 However , the lack of available census data and uniform reporting of Arab 193 ethnicity in medical records precludes rigorous analysis of COVID - 19 infection and mortality risks among this im - 194 portant group . 195 Because of the deep structural roots of the disparities identiﬁed in this analysis , it is easy - but wrongheaded - to 196 conclude that there is nothing to be done . The ﬂuid nature of the COVID - 19 pandemic and its response provides 197 opportunities to slow the tide of transmission and death . For this to be the case , however , similar amounts of effort 198 to what is being done to ensure that college campuses and other workplaces can re - open safely needs to be focused 199 on increasing the quality and quantity of testing , healthcare and social support among people of color . Further , there 200 is a need to examine the racialized dismantaling of public infrastructure and systematic divestment which drives 201 disparities in both exposure , susceptibility and mortality . 30 However , while understanding the causes of disparate 202 outcomes is important , it does not necessarily instruct us on what to do next . If the current pandemic teaches us 203 something , it is that closing the gap in infection and mortality during the current catastrophe - and preventing such 204 inequities in the next one - requires a re - orientation around an ‘epidemiology of consequence’ 31 that is focused on 205 identifying strategies to attack the structural and practical barriers to health equity before the next disaster strikes . 206 9 .
