hours after transfection . COS - 7 cells were incubat - ed with EGF ( 0 . 1 m g / ml ) [ biotinylated , complexed to Texas Red—streptoavidin ( Molecular Probes , Eu - gene , OR ) ] in binding buffer [ 20 mM Hepes—NaOH ( pH 7 . 5 ) , 130 mM NaCl , and 0 . 1 % bovine serum albumin ] at 4¡C for 60 min . Internalization of EGF was allowed by incubation in Dulbecco(cid:213)s modi(cid:222)ed Eagle(cid:213)s medium at 37¡C for 10 min , then excess EGF was removed with 0 . 2 M AcOH ( pH 2 . 5 ) and 0 . 5 M NaCl at 4¡C for 5 min . Cells were (cid:222)xed in 3 . 7 % formaldehyde , permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Tri - ton X - 100 , and immunostained with a polyclonal antibody to myc ( Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Santa Cruz , CA ) and (cid:223)uorescein isothiocyanate—conju - gated antibody to rabbit ( Organon Teknika , Boxtel , Netherlands ) . Internalization of EGF was observed by confocal microscopy ( Bio - Rad ) . 37 . We thank Y .

J . Ford , Barbara M . F . Pearse , Matthew K . Higgins , Yvonne Vallis , David J . Owen , Adele Gibson , * Colin R . Hopkins , * Philip R . Evans , † Harvey T . McMahon † Adaptor protein 180 ( AP180 ) and its homolog , clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia protein ( CALM ) , are closely related proteins that play im - portant roles in clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Here , we present the structure of the NH 2 - terminal domain of CALM bound to phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate [ PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] via a lysine - rich motif . This motif is found in other proteins predicted to have domains of similar structure ( for example , Hun - tingtin interacting protein 1 ) . The structure is in part similar to the epsin NH 2 - terminal ( ENTH ) domain , but epsin lacks the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding site . Because AP180 could bind to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and clathrin simultaneously , it may serve to tether clathrin to the membrane . This was shown by using puri(cid:222)ed components and a budding assay on preformed lipid monolayers . In the pres - ence of AP180 , clathrin lattices formed on the monolayer . When AP2 was also present , coated pits were formed . Budding of clathrin - coated vesicles is a pro - cess by which cells package specific cargo into vesicles in a regulated fashion ( 1 – 3 ) . Important functions are the uptake of nutri - ents , the regulation of receptor and transport - er numbers on the plasma membrane , and the recycling of synaptic vesicles . AP180 and AP2 are both major components of clathrin coats . AP2 is a heterotetrameric complex that binds to phosphoinositides in the membrane and to the cytoplasmic domains of membrane proteins destined for internalization ( 1 , 3 , 4 ) . AP2 binds clathrin and can stimulate clathrin cage assembly in vitro ( 5 , 6 ) . It also interacts with a range of cytoplasmic proteins includ - ing AP180 ( 7 ) . Like AP2 , AP180 also binds directly to clathrin and can stimulate clathrin cage assembly in vitro , limiting the size dis - tribution of the resulting cages ( 8 – 11 ) . The related proteins , CALM ( AP180 - 2 , a close homolog of synaptic AP180 ) , LAP ( the Dro - sophila AP180 homolog ) , and UNC - 11 ( the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog ) , are all im - plicated in clathrin - coated vesicle endocyto - sis ( 12 , 13 ) . CALM was identified and named because of its homology to AP180 and to reflect its involvement in t ( 10 ; 11 ) chromo - somal translocations found in various leuke - mias ( 14 ) . Disruptions of the LAP and Unc - 11 genes impair clathrin - dependent recycling of synaptic vesicles , resulting in fewer vesi - cles of more variable size . The NH 2 - terminal domain of AP180 ( AP180 - N ) shows the highest degree of conservation across AP180 homologs , and binds to inositol polyphos - phates ( 10 , 15 , 16 ) , whereas the COOH - terminal domain contains the putative clath - rin - and AP2 - binding sites ( Fig . 1A ) . When expressed in COS - 7 fibroblasts , both full - length AP180 and AP180 - C ( residues 530 to 915 ) inhibited uptake of epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) and transferrin ( 17 ) ( Fig . 1B ) , as is the case for CALM ( 18 ) . Clathrin was redis - tributed in transfected cells , and we noted fewer coated pits per unit of cell surface – membrane length ( 8 % of control , Fig . 1C ) . This showed that endocytosis was inhibited by blocking clathrin - coated pit formation , consistent with the ability of the COOH - terminus to bind clath - rin and to stimulate cage assembly in vitro ( 8 – 11 ) . However , AP180 - N overexpression did not inhibit EGF or transferrin uptake ( Fig . 1B ) . It had no apparent protein - binding partners but is more localized to the plasma membrane , consistent with binding to polyphosphoinosi - tides ( 15 , 16 ) . To probe the molecular basis of phospho - inositide interactions , we solved the structure of the NH 2 - terminal domain from the close AP180 homolog , CALM , at 2 Å resolution ( 19 , 20 ) ( crystals of AP180 - N did not diffract well ) . There were nine a helices forming a solenoid structure ( Fig . 2 ) . This is reminis - cent of other protein families formed from a superhelix of a helices such as the armadillo ( 21 ) and tetratricopeptide repeat ( 22 ) do - mains , but it is most similar to the ENTH domain of epsin ( 23 ) ( Fig . 2B ) . The first seven helices of epsin superimposed well on those of CALM . In epsin , however , the final a 8 helix folded back across the others , whereas in CALM the final three long helices continued the solenoidal pattern . Because of the high sequence homology of CALM - N and AP180 - N ( 81 % sequence identity ) ( Fig . 2 ) , we can safely assume that the NH 2 - termi - nal domain of AP180 has the same structure . X - ray data were collected at 2 Å resolution from CALM - N crystals soaked in a series of inositol phosphates and phospholipids . Binding was observed for inositol hexakisphosphate ( D - myo - inositol - 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 - hexakisphosphate , InsP 6 ) , inositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate [ Ins ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] , and a soluble short - chain ( diC 8 ) L - a - D - myo - phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate . No sig - nificant binding was observed in the crystal for short - chain ( diC 8 ) L - a - D - myo - phosphatidylino - sitol - 3 , 4 , 5 - trisphosphate . The binding site is unusual ( Fig . 2 ) : Typical ligand - binding sites on proteins lie in a pocket or groove , but this site is on the surface , with the phosphates perched on the tips of the side chains of three lysines and a histidine , like a ball balanced on the fingertips . In all ligands , only the two phosphates were well ordered and contacted the protein . The cluster of lysines and histidine formed a marked positively charged patch on the surface ( Fig . 2C ) , appropriate for a phos - phate - binding protein . Database searches with the AP180 - N / CALM - N identified several classes of related sequences ( Fig . 2H ) . First , there were the members of the AP180 family itself , with a conserved NH 2 - terminal domain , having PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding motifs , which we iden - tified from the observed binding in the crys - tal , K ( X ) 9 KX ( K / R ) ( H / Y ) . The COOH - termi - nal domains of these proteins contain clath - rin - binding motifs ( 3 , 24 ) , as well as Asp - Pro - Phe ( DPF ) - like a - and b - adaptin – Medical Research Council ( MRC ) Laboratory of Mo - lecular Biology , Hills Road , Cambridge , CB2 2QH , UK . * MRC Laboratory of Molecular and Cell Biology , Uni - versity College London , Gower Street , London , WC1E 6BT , UK . † To whom correspondence should be addressed .

Second , there were other proteins similar to AP180 , containing the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding motifs , but having unrelated COOH - terminal re - gions . Of these proteins , Huntingtin interact - ing protein 1 ( HIP1 ) and SLA2p have actin - binding regions in their COOH - termini . Third , there were the epsin - related proteins ; these showed a lower sequence homology in the NH 2 - terminus but shared the same struc - ture for at least the first 140 residues ( Fig . 2 ) . They lack completely the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - bind - ing motif , but have a signature ( D / E ) PW motif in the loop connecting a 1 to a 2 . Ac - cording to our predictions , a - adaptin ( which has no sequence homology to AP180 ) has a PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding motif near its NH 2 - ter - minus between the first two predicted helices . Indeed , a fragment from this region of the protein has been shown to bind PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( 4 ) . Specificity of the phosphoinositide inter - action with AP180 - N and CALM - N was test - ed by sedimentation assays using liposomes or lipid tubules ( 19 , 27 , 28 ) . Tubules contain - ing 10 % PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 efficiently sedimented AP180 - N and CALM - N with the same appar - ent affinity ( K M values of 4 . 6 6 0 . 7 m M and 5 . 8 6 1 . 7 m M , respectively ) but mutations in the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 motif ( KKK - EEE ) abol - ished sedimentation ( Fig . 3A ) . AP180 - N was likewise sedimented with liposomes contain - ing 10 % PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , but not with lipo - somes when replaced with 10 % phosphati - dylserine ( PtdSer ) , or 10 % PtdIns , or 10 % PtdIns ( 3 , 4 ) P 2 and less efficiently with lipo - somes containing 10 % PtdIns ( 4 ) P or 10 % PtdIns ( 3 , 5 ) P 2 or 10 % PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( Fig . 3B ) . Full - length AP180 binds to lipid tubules or liposomes containing PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 with characteristics similar to those of AP180 - N ; however , a mutant in the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - bind - ing motif ( KKK - EKE ) does not ( Fig . 3C ) . Combinations of full - length AP180 , AP2 , and clathrin were then tested in sed - imentation assays with PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - con - taining liposomes . AP2 was sedimented both in the presence and absence of AP180 ( Fig . 3C ) . Clathrin only sedimented in the presence of AP180 [ but not the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - bind - ing motif mutant ] , and then it associated preferentially with the lipid - bound AP180 . Incubation of AP180 , AP2 , and clathrin resulted in the sedimentation of all compo - nents , and the clathrin in the pellet was resistant to 1 % Triton X - 100 treatment , implying a degree of polymerization ( addi - tion of Triton X - 100 has been used as a purification step in the isolation of clathrin coats ) . Specificity of sedimentation was confirmed by using a number of controls including the absence of liposomes ( Fig . 3C ) . Fig . 1 . Overexpression of AP180 in COS - 7 cells inhibits endocyto - sis .

R E P O R T S 9 FEBRUARY 2001 VOL 291 SCIENCE www . sciencemag . org 1052 The recruitment of clathrin by AP180 was further investigated by electron mi - croscopy to visualize clathrin lattice and cage formation . In the presence of AP180 and clathrin , latticelike structures formed on the surface of lipid monolayers ( 29 ) ( Fig . 4A ) . Addition of AP2 resulted in the formation of more distinct electron - dense areas of clathrin assembly ( Fig . 4B ) . Sin - gle - angle platinum shadowing of negative - ly stained grids showed that in the absence of AP2 the lattice was predominantly flat ( Fig . 4C ) . Invaginated coated buds were formed in the presence of AP2 ( Fig . 4D ) . The diameter was well within the expected size range for brain - derived coated vesi - cles . In the absence of AP180 , no detect - able intermediates were visible by electron microscopy . When PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 was re - placed by PtdIns , the flat clathrin lattices were no longer seen ( Fig . 4E ) . Our experiments demonstrate that the minimal requirements for the initial stage of coated pit invagination are clathrin , AP180 , AP2 , and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - containing membranes . However , with these compo - nents , the pits do not invaginate complete - ly , even in the presence of excess clathrin . AP180 concentrates clathrin on the mem - brane , and AP2s stimulate curved lattice assembly , consistent with their coat assem - bly activity ( 6 ) . On a more general note , we show that the AP180 NH 2 - terminal domain is a PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding domain respon - sible for membrane localization of AP180 , and we propose that similar domains found in other proteins will also recruit them specifically to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich membranes .

( C and D ) Single - angle platinum - shadowed monolayers showed that the clathrin assemblies were budded from the lipid surface in the presence of AP2 ( inset : rotary platinum shadowing ) . We have shown more dense area of the grids compared with the negatively stained panels . ( E to H ) Controls showed no evidence of clathrin assemblies . R E P O R T S 9 FEBRUARY 2001 VOL 291 SCIENCE www . sciencemag . org 1054 After concentration , the protein was passed through an S200 gel (cid:222)ltration column , using run - ning buffer ( 20 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , 150 mM NaCl , 4 mM DTT ) . Clathrin and AP2 were puri(cid:222)ed from fresh pig brain as previously described ( 34 ) . AP2 was dialyzed against 50 mM triethanolamine - KCl , pH 8 . 0 , 200 mM NaCl , 0 . 2 mM EDTA , 0 . 1 % b - mer - captoethanol , and 0 . 02 % NaN 3 . Clathrin cage for - mation was performed as described previously ( 6 ) in 25 mM Hepes , 125 mM K acetate , and 1 mM Mg acetate , pH 7 . 4 . 20 . Crystals of CALM - N ( residues 1 to 289 ) were grown in seeded hanging drops against a reservoir containing 0 . 1 M Hepes , pH 7 . 5 , 12 to 14 % PEG 8000 , and 8 % ethylene glycol . They belong to space group P4 1 2 1 2 , cell dimensions a 5 b 5 77 . 93 (cid:129) , c 5 121 . 81 (cid:129) , with one molecule per asymmet - ric unit . For the binding studies , crystals were soaked for 1 hour in 1 mM ligand in 0 . 1 M Hepes , pH 7 . 5 , 14 % PEG 8000 , and 8 % ethylene glycol . We were unable to (cid:222)nd suitable conditions for cryoprotection , so all data sets were collected at room temperature from crystals mounted in cap - illaries , on beamline 9 . 6 at SRS Daresbury , l 5 0 . 88 (cid:129) . By setting the ADSC Quantum 4 charge - coupled device detector to the fastest readout time ( ; 3 s ) and using a 3 - s exposure for a 1¡ rotation , a 90¡ data set could be collected in less than 10 min with acceptable radiation damage . Images were inte - grated using Mos(cid:223)m ( 35 ) and scaled using CCP4 programs ( 36 ) . All data sets extended to 2 (cid:129) res - olution and were reasonably strong to 2 . 1 (cid:129) reso - lution ( see PDB depositions and Table 1 for de - tails ) . Phases were derived from a single mercury derivative with two sites ( crystals soaked for 1 hour in 1 mM ethylmercury thiosalicylate ) by the program Sharp ( 37 ) . Solvent (cid:223)attening with So - lomon led to an easily interpretable map . The model was built using O ( 38 ) and re(cid:222)ned using Refmac5 ( 39 ) . The termini ( 1 to 19 and 281 to 289 ) were not visible . Density was weak around the a 7 to a 8 loop ( 149 to 165 ) ; around the a 9 to a 10 loop ( 215 to 237 ) ; and the COOH - terminal region from about 267 . Final R factors for the native and com - plexes were 0 . 187 to 0 . 195 ( R free 0 . 215 to 0 . 230 ) . Coordinates have been deposited in the PDB with access codes 1hf8 ( native ) , 1hfa [ PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] , 1hg2 [ Ins ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] , and 1hg5 ( InsP 6 ) . 21 . E . Conti , M . Uy , L .

Lipid tubules [ 10 % PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , 10 % cholesterol , 40 % phosphatidylcholine , 40 % NFA - galactocere - brosides type II ] were prepared as described in ( 40 ) . Liposomes [ 10 % PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , 10 % PtdSer , 10 % cholesterol , 35 % phosphatidylcholine , and 35 % phosphatidylethanolamine ] were prepared by evaporating solvent from an appropriate mixture of lipids under a constant stream of argon . After resuspension in 10 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , the mixtures were extruded through a (cid:222)lter with pore size 0 . 1 m M . Initially , tubules were used for comparison with our studies on dynamin , whose pleckstrin homology domain binds phosphoinositol head groups ( 40 ) . Moreover , tubules are easier to sedi - ment than liposomes . Dynamin was also used in the liposome experiments as a positive control for the incorporation of phosphatidyl inositols . 28 . Protein ( s ) and liposomes or tubules ( as appropri - ate ) were added to reaction buffer ( 25 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , 125 mM K acetate , 1 mM Mg acetate ) in a polycarbonate centrifuge tube ( (cid:222)nal volume of each experiment 50 or 100 m l ) . Experiments were incubated at room temperature for 30 min before sedimentation by centrifugation ( 78 , 000 g for 20 min in a TLA100 rotor ) and analyzed by Coo - massie - stained gels . Densitometry was carried out using a Molecular Dynamics scanner and bands were integrated using ImageQuant for Macintosh v1 . 2 . 29 . A monolayer of lipid [ same composition as 10 % PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 liposomes ] was formed on the sur - face of a buffer droplet in a Te(cid:223)on block ( 41 ) , and the protein ( s ) of interest were introduced into the buffer . After 5 min , a carbon - coated gold electron microscopy grid was placed onto the monolayer . After 1 hour , the grid was removed and stained with uranyl acetate ( 2 % uranyl acetate , 0 . 0025 % polyacrylic acid ) . The technique has been used for the generation of two - dimensional crystals ( 41 , 42 ) and , to our knowledge , has not been applied to study the formation of endocytic intermediates . Potassium in the buffer was critical for the ef(cid:222)cient polymerization of clathrin in keeping with previous observations ( 43 ) . 30 . D . J . Owen et al . , Cell 97 , 805 ( 1999 ) . 31 . L .

A lateral signal from P6 . p then activates the Notch signaling pathway in the neighboring cells P5 . p and P7 . p to prevent them from adopting the primary fate and to specify the sec - ondary fate . The MAP kinase phosphatase LIP - 1 mediates this lateral inhi - bition of the primary fate . LIN - 12 / NOTCH up - regulates lip - 1 transcription in P5 . p and P7 . p where LIP - 1 inactivates the MAP kinase to inhibit primary fate speci(cid:222)cation . LIP - 1 thus links the two signaling pathways to generate a pattern . MAP kinase phosphatases ( MKPs ) belong to the family of dual - specificity phospha - tases that inactivate different types of MAP kinases by dephosphorylating the critical phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine res - idues of the kinases ( 1 ) . The transcription of MKPs is rapidly induced by various stimuli such as growth factors and cellular stresses that activate MAP kinases , sug - gesting that MKPs may participate in an autoinhibitory feedback loop . To study the role of MKPs in RTK / RAS / MAPK signaling during development , we searched the C . elegans genome se - quence for homologs of vertebrate MKPs . Among the 185 predicted phosphatases , we identified a candidate , termed lip - 1 ( lateral signal induced phosphatase 2 1 , open read - Division of Cancer Research , Department of Patholo - gy , University of Zu‹rich , Schmelzbergstrasse 12 , CH - 8091 Zu‹rich , Switzerland . * To whom correspondence should be addressed .
