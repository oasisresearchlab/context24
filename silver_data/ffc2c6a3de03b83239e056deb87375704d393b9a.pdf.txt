By forming a physical boundary between cells and their environment that is also a biochemical platform , the plasma membrane ( PM ) is a key interface mediating both cellular response to mech - anical stimuli , and subsequent biochemical responses . Here , we review the role of the PM as a mechanosensing structure . We first analyse how the PM responds to mechanical stresses , and then discuss how this mechanical response triggers downstream biochemical responses . The molecular players involved in PM mechanochemical transduction include sensors of membrane unfolding , membrane tension , membrane curvature or mem - brane domain rearrangement . These sensors trigger signalling cascades fundamental both in healthy scenarios and in diseases such as cancer , which cells harness to maintain integrity , keep or restore homeostasis and adapt to their external environment . This article is part of a discussion meeting issue ‘Forces in cancer : interdisciplinary approaches in tumour mechanobiology’ . 1 . Introduction By forming a physical boundary permitting the segregation of specific chemical reactions , the self - association of amphiphilic lipid molecules played an impor - tant role in the origin of life . Accordingly , the plasma membrane ( PM ) of prokaryotes and eukaryotes constitutes a fundamental border between the cell and its environment , and tightly regulates the exchanges between the inside and outside of the cell . Its physical state and integrity are crucial for cell survival , and a major function of the PM is to preserve its integrity and enable changes in cell shape . These changes occur in response not only to cell processes such as division , migration or spreading , but also to the constant external mechanical forces present in physiological scenarios . Mechanical stimuli destabilize cellular homeostasis and are strongly associated with cancer [ 1 , 2 ] , and cells need to respond to either maintain their integrity or trigger appropriate responses . In this context , the PM constitutes a crucial interface , since mechanical forces will result in a change of its state . Accordingly , extensive work ( which we cite here non - exhaustively ) has addressed how membrane tension interplays with the actin cytoskeleton ( CSK ) to regulate cell shape [ 3 – 5 ] , motility [ 6 – 9 ] and polarity [ 10 , 11 ] . Correspondingly , many reviews discuss the feedback between membrane mech - anical properties , CSK organization and cell dynamics [ 12 – 19 ] . Whereas in this review we will not analyse this feedback in detail , we will address a related and equally important topic : how the PM can harness mechanically induced changes in its state to itself act as a mechanosensor . We will first detail the different types of external mechanical stimuli that can be applied to the PM , and its subsequent & 2019 The Authors .

Then , we will review how this PM response triggers specific molecular mechanosensing events , mediated by diverse mechanosensory molecules that share a common principle : they are sensitive to a mechanical state of the PM , or to achange of this state . Accordingly , they transduce the external mechanical input transmitted from the PM into a biochemical response . To decouple the effect of each particular signal , wewill not consider inputs composed of multiple mech - anical signals ( such as those usually present in three - dimensional geometries ) . Therefore , we limit the review to two - dimensional in vitro systems and examine the acute response of mammalian cells to a single mechanical input . 2 . Effect of external mechanical stimuli on the plasma membrane The highly complex PM delimits the cell , and is in permanent contact with its surroundings . As such , it constitutes a crucial interface , since interactions with or alterations from the exter - nal environment will result in a change of its mechanical state . Whereas all living cells ( eukaryotic or prokaryotic ) receive a large diversity of mechanical inputs , here we will focus on the PM of animal cells . Examples of such cells in a mechanically active environment include alveolar epithelial cells in lungs , which cyclically stretch and relax , or skin cells , which also experience transient stretch , but without a cyclic rhythm . Cells in the intestinal track withstand trans - mural pressure , shear flow and cyclic strains [ 20 ] , and smooth muscle cells in the bladder [ 21 ] or in ocular cells [ 22 ] are exposed to hydrostatic pressure . Vascular endothelial cells , circulating cells such as red blood cells , and cells from the immune system are exposed to shear flows [ 23 , 24 ] . Among a plethora of other cells , circulating cells ( RBC ) s pas - sing in the kidney medullae [ 25 ] , cells in the renal medullae [ 26 ] and cells exposed to the environment undergo important osmotic changes , which will stretch or compress cells . Top - ography is another external crucial mechanical cue , as many adherent cells must physically adapt to a topographi - cally heterogeneous substrate such as the extracellular matrix ( ECM ) [ 27 ] . From a mechanical perspective , these stimuli can be grouped as tensile stresses ( as applied by cell stretching and hypo - osmotic treatments ) , compressive stres - ses ( as applied by cell compression and hyper - osmotic treatments ) and shear stresses ( as applied by shear flows acting on adherent cells ) [ 28 ] . In this section , we will focus on experiments mainly applying only one of these stimuli , and we will not analyse their combined effects ( as could occur for instance in cells flowing through narrow constric - tions ) [ 29 ] . As such , we will not consider three - dimensional geometries as they would lead to complex mechanical inputs . ( a ) Tensile stresses Tensile stresses on the PM are commonly applied through hypotonic treatments [ 30 – 32 ] , both to adhering and sus - pended cells ( figure 1 a ( i ) ) . Cells respond by swelling , thereby expanding their volume . Such osmotic treatments raise the issue of potential chemical responses triggered in par - allel to the mechanical response [ 33 , 34 ] . Alternatively , cells adhered to flexible membranes can be stretched uniaxially or equibiaxially [ 31 , 35 ] ( figure 1 a ( ii ) ) , thereby regulating PM area more directly . In both types of experiment , there is an increase in PM apparent tension , a measure containing the PM tension and the tension induced by adhesion to the under - lying CSK , to which the PM is strongly attached ( see further details in box 2 ) . Indeed , application of 40 – 70 % osmotic treat - ments increases apparent tension in neuron cells [ 32 ] , fibroblasts [ 3 ] and human leukaemia cells ( HL - 60 ) [ 36 ] , and application of a 40 % uniaxial stretch increases apparent ten - sion in human leukaemia cells [ 36 ] . In these assays , tension most likely increases both in the PM and in the underlying cytoskeletal actin cortex . The CSK is in fact thought to have mechano protective effects on the poorly extensible PM , which resists only a 3 – 5 % area expansion before lysis , or rup - ture [ 8 , 28 ] . The CSK prevents tension - induced PM rupture by absorbing part of the applied stress [ 33 , 37 ] . Consistently , apparent PM tensions in unstressed cells range from 0 . 03 to 0 . 3 mN m 2 1 [ 16 , 38 ] , far from the estimated rupture tension of a bilayer , 3 – 10 mN m 2 1 [ 8 , 13 , 38 , 39 ] . Upon stress application , however , cells have multiple ways of supplying lipids to the PM to buffer tension increases . First , highly abundant PM folds ( see box 1 ) flatten upon tensile stress application [ 15 , 30 , 31 ] ( figure 1 a ( iv ) ) . Caveolae are an important type of such folds [ 40 ] , exerting a PM mechanoprotective role directly [ 41 ] ( rather than through caveolae endocytosis ) . Second , exocytosis contrib - utes to PM area expansion [ 35 , 42 – 45 ] by adding lipids to the bilayer . Exocytosis occurs in response to PM tension increase [ 38 ] ( figure 1 a ( v ) ) . Interestingly , simple membrane mechanics could drive this process , as stretching a supported lipid bilayer leads to passive absorption of liposomes sitting on top of it [ 46 ] . Similarly , endocytosis arrest has been associ - ated with increased PM tension , as observed for instance during osmotic swelling of rat basophilic leukaemia ( RBL ) cells [ 47 ] . Here again , tension may facilitate molecularly driven exocytosis [ 38 , 39 ] . Overall , the cell capacity to expand its area under tensile stress will thus depend not only on the nature and the mag - nitude of the stretch , but also on the PM lipid reserves in the form of folds and endomembranes [ 48 ] . For instance , the abundance of caveolae is cell - type - dependent , and they are highly abundant specifically in smooth muscle cells ( highly exposed to stretch ) , and in endothelial cells ( highly exposed to shear flows ) [ 49 ] . Moreover , cells have very different rest - ing tensions depending on their type [ 17 , 33 ] and state [ 3 , 48 ] and may even display heterogeneous apparent tension distri - bution within the PM upon application of local stimuli [ 50 ] . Such differences may explain why the cellular response to osmotic treatment is strongly cell - type - dependent : in a range of cell types , PM area expansion prevented tension increases upon hypotonic treatments of 50 % , but not of 98 % [ 43 ] . However , in mouse lung endothelial ( MLEC ) cells , a 50 % hypotonic treatment did not lead to an increase in tension unless caveolar proteins were knocked down [ 40 ] . Additionally , the physiological relevance of large osmo - tic treatments in most physiological situations was questioned in a recent study [ 51 ] , and for instance a value of 20 % ( measured to be insufficient to affect tension ) was found to be closer to physiological values in endothelial cells . In any case , the magnitude of osmotic treatment or stretch needed to increase PM tension after cells have depleted their lipid reserves , and its relationship to the rel - evant physiology of each cell type , remain an open question . At the molecular level , an increase in PM tension ( and thereby membrane area ) is predicted to decrease its thickness , r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s t b Ph il .

This could directly affect transmembrane protein conformation , decrease lipid packing and facilitate diffusion in the lipid bilayer . This was predicted in 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ( DOPC ) bilayers [ 52 ] and observed upon application of an osmotic treatment in synthetic giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) made of DOPC [ 53 ] .

PM response to applied mechanical stimuli . ( a ) Tensile stresses are applied experimentally by tether pulling , hypotonic shocks and cell stretching . In response , PM folds flatten and exocytosis increases , buffering the increase in tension . Once lipid reserves have been used , PM tension and order increase . ( b ) Compressive stresses are applied experimentally through hyper - osmotic shocks and stretch release . In response , PM folds of different shapes and sizes form ( vacu - ole - like dilations ( VLDs ) , tubes ) , endocytosis increases , lipid packing defects appear in highly curved areas and phosphoinositide ( PI ) clusters form . ( c ) Shear stress application results in increased PM fluidity , in both L o and L d phases . ( d ) Upon encountering topographical cues , cells adapt their PM to substrate architecture , likely triggering a temporary increase in PM tension . r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s t b Ph il .

B 374 : 2018022 1 3 triggered phase separation and appearance of liquid - ordered ( L o ) domains in the PM ( see box 1 ) [ 53 , 54 ] , which is in oppo - sition to some theoretical predictions [ 55 ] ( figure 1 a ( vi ) ) . Increased PM order was also observed upon uniaxial stretch of vascular endothelial cells [ 56 ] , coupled with a slower diffu - sion as assessed by FRAP ( fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ) measurement . Similarly , increased PM order occurred upon application of a hypoosmotic treatment in HeLa or MDCK cells [ 53 ] . Both effects ( phase separation and lipid unpacking ) would likely affect lipid raft organiz - ation and dynamics ( see box 1 ) . However , they would , respectively , increase or decrease packing and diffusion in the bilayer , and therefore the overall effect of PM tension remains unclear . ( b ) Compressive stresses When stretch is released , or if a hyperosmotic treatment is applied , a decrease in apparent tension has been consistently measured [ 32 , 57 , 58 ] ( figure 1 b ( i , ii ) ) . Compression also leads to PM bending [ 28 ] . In the case of hyperosmotic treatments ( or restoration of medium tonicity after an isotonic treat - ment ) , dome - shaped micrometre - sized invaginations termed vacuole - like dilations ( VLDs ) form passively [ 31 – 33 ] . VLDs are only observed at the basal substrate - bound side of the PM ( figure 1 b ( iii ) ) , and we demonstrated that they were due to expulsion from cells of water which was not absorbed by hydrophobic substrates such as glass coverslips [ 31 ] . If cells are seeded on porous substrates , water can flow through and VLDs are not observed . Upon stretch release , passive PM folds also form , both in DOPC - supported lipid bilayers [ 46 , 59 ] and in the PM of several cell types [ 31 ] ( figure 1 b ( vi ) ) . These folds can be dot - shaped sub - micrometre structures termed reservoirs , or longer tubes , depending on the magnitude of de - stretch . Such structures locally deform the PM , thereby accommodating the lipid excess caused by compression . Similarly , caveolae that had been unfolded by tensile stress re - form upon stress release [ 60 ] . Interestingly , VLDs can also form upon stretch release on poroelastic sub - strates , owing to water flow out of the substrate [ 31 , 61 ] . Thus , the PM can deform during compression , either by accommodating excess PM in small folds , or by generating VLDs to accommodate water effluxes . Unlike in the case of stretch , adaptation to osmotic changes does not seem to require the formation of PM structures to accommodate excess PM area , likely because , particularly in flat cells , changes in cell volume induced by osmotic treatments can be accommodated with very small changes in PM area . Con - sistently , another study reported that hypertonic treatments affected cell shape and volume but not PM topology [ 30 ] . In all cases and regardless of their nature , reservoirs , tubes and VLDs are subsequently actively re - absorbed in the PM after formation [ 31 ] . Endocytosis also intervenes as an additional mechanism for handling the extra lipids in the PM [ 62 ] ( figure 1 b ( iv ) ) . Analogously to tensile stresses , compressive stresses also lead to lipid reorganization , owing to both decreased tension and formation of highly curved structures . Experiments in GUVs showed formation of lipid packing defects in highly curved structures [ 63 , 64 ] in both L o and L d phases [ 65 ] , which may facilitate the insertion of hydrophobic molecules ( figure 1 b ( v ) ) . In addition , high bilayer curvature can lead to lipid sorting or changes in the lipid phases . Indeed , simu - lations revealed correlation between lipid clustering and lipid bilayer curvature [ 66 ] . Experimentally , pulling tubes from GUVs led to the enrichment of unsaturated compared with saturated lipids close to phase separation [ 67 ] , short chain lipids have a preference for highly curved bilayers in vitro [ 63 ] and stretch release in yeast led to the formation of invaginations enriched in phosphoinositides ( PIs ) [ 58 ] Box 1 . Mechanical and molecular features of the plasma membrane The cellular PM has evolved to become an extremely complex entity , bearing an asymmetric bilayer considered as a two - dimensional fluid formed by glycerophospholipids , sphingolipids , cholesterol and carbohydrates , as well as high amounts of transmembrane or peripheral proteins . A key PM parameter is its fluidity ( also referred as its reciprocal viscosity , which is the internal property of a fluid that offers resistance to flow [ 23 ] ) . Fluidity is commonly related to high molecular mobility in the bilayer , which enables lateral diffusion of the embedded molecules [ 73 ] . Diffusion in the PM is slower than in a pure lipid bilayer [ 179 ] because of its lateral organization , especially through the presence of peripheral and transmembrane proteins [ 180 ] , its shape and its attachment to the cytoskeleton ( CSK ) . The complex composition of the PM results in lateral liquid – liquid phase separation of the bilayer in liquid - disordered ( L d ) and liquid - ordered ( L o ) domains , with reduced diffusion in the latter . L o domains in the PM ( also called lipid rafts ) are enriched in cholesterol , sphin - golipids and transmembrane or anchored proteins , display a higher lipid packing and dynamically assemble and disassemble at a fast rate in domains of different sizes [ 181 ] . Of note , controversies remain about the organization and dynamics of these domains [ 182 ] . Another fundamental PM parameter is its topography . The PM has a spontaneous curvature conferred by its composition and asymmetry and is not a smooth bilayer [ 183 ] . It contains actively maintained folds in the form of micro - and nano - struc - tures such as ruffles , microvilli or caveolae [ 13 ] . Among them , caveolae are small PM invaginations ( 20 – 100 nm ) shaped by caveolin and cavin proteins [ 102 , 184 , 185 ] . Caveolae are enriched in glycosphingolipids and cholesterol but are apparently devoid of transmembrane proteins [ 186 ] . These folds are actively maintained through mechanochemical feedbacks which have been the object of many studies [ 80 , 132 , 187 ] . The PM is also strongly coupled to the CSK through different biochemical links . ERM proteins ( ezrin , radixin and moesin proteins ) [ 188 ] mediate PM attachment to the cortex , and actin filaments also attach to caveolae [ 184 ] , lipid rafts [ 189 ] and recently described asters ( actin - based PM nanoclusters ) [ 181 ] . Such PM – CSK inter - action may locally impair diffusion and organize the PM as a ‘fence and picket’ bilayer [ 190 ] . The PM constantly undergoes fusion ( exocytic ) and fission ( endocytic ) events through a variety of pathways [ 191 ] , ensuring protein and lipid turnover as well as chemical communication with the outside environment . Endocytosis decreases PM area while exocytosis increases it . r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s t b Ph il . T r a n s . R . S o c . B 374 : 2018022 1 4 ( figure 1 b ( v ) ) . Finally , a decrease in the PM tension through hyperosmotic treatment has been associated with a decrease in L o areas in HeLa cells [ 53 ] , which would be expected to facilitate diffusion in the bilayer . ( c ) Shear stresses Different studies have consistently found a rapid increase in PM disorder upon shear flow application ( figure 1 c ( i ) ) , either by using Laurdan imaging ( a membrane fluorescent dye sensitive to local membrane packing [ 56 ] ) , a molecular rotor probe [ 68 ] or an FRET - based molecular sensor [ 69 ] ( figure 1 c ( ii ) ) . Although shear flows exert both a tensile stress from the hydrostatic pressure and a shear stress on the PM [ 24 , 70 ] , the effect was specifically attributed to shear stress in one of the studies [ 56 ] . In this study , the increased disorder was coupled to increased diffusion in both GUVs and cells . This fluidization occurs to both L d and L o domains ( although at different time scales [ 71 ] ) , and in caveolae [ 72 ] . How shear stress leads to those effects is intriguing , but potential mechanisms include an increase in PM resistance to shear flow caused by L o domains [ 73 ] , or effects in membrane tension . Indeed , shear traction on the cell surface induced by shear flow may modify membrane tension and its uniformity , as reported in a recent study [ 69 ] . However , increased apparent tension has been associ - ated with increased ( rather than decreased ) order , as discussed previously in this article . ( d ) Topographical cues The topography surrounding cells also constitutes a mechan - ical stimulus , in that the cellular PM that is at the interface will be forced to adapt to the shape of the substrate ( figure 1 d ( i ) ) . In vivo , cells are often in contact with the ECM , a very heterogeneous material presenting changes in topography that shape the PM [ 27 ] . To mimic rough or con - fined topographies , cells have been seeded on micropatterned substrates of a variety of shapes , confining cell adhesion to restricted areas [ 74 – 76 ] . As expected , cells adapt their volume and area to the patterns . Nanoneedles [ 76 ] , nanocones [ 77 ] or nanopillars [ 78 ] 50 – 500 nm in diam - eter have also been engineered on a substrate before cells were seeded on top . Electron microscopy images confirmed that the PM wrapped around the pillars , adopting a highly curved configuration [ 79 ] ( figure 1 d ( ii ) ) . Therefore , external topography deforms the PM , and probably also induces a temporary increase in tension [ 80 ] . 3 . Plasma membrane mechanical state sensors When mechanical stimuli affect PM shape and tension , the cell responds to restore its homeostasis [ 33 ] . Fast responses occur to temporarily accommodate the new mechanical state of the PM and prevent cell lysis , while adaptative responses occur if the mechanical stimulus is repeated or maintained [ 81 – 83 ] . The signalling cascades triggered by the PM response rely on mechanotransduction events , in which specific mechanosensing molecules sense mechani - cally induced changes in the PM and trigger a biochemical response . Unravelling the nature and function of these mol - ecules is highly relevant , since they are the first sensors in subsequent complex signalling cascades that define cell response . In this section , we will focus on the players relevant at short time scales , in response to the mechanical stimuli described above . Long - term cellular adaptation of cells to cyclic or permanent external mechanical stimuli ( often abnor - mal and leading to disease states ) goes beyond the scope of this review and we refer the reader to recent reviews on the topic [ 20 , 81 ] . ( a ) Sensors of tensile and shear stresses ( i ) Protein conformational changes : response to plasma membrane tension Mechanically gated channels ( MGCs ) are clear players in PM mechanotransduction [ 84 – 87 ] . MGCs are integral membrane proteins that undergo a conformational change in response to an area expansion of the PM ( figure 2 a ) . They are activated by Box 2 . Plasma membrane tension The tension in a lipid bilayer membrane is defined as the force per unit length acting on a cross - section of a membrane [ 15 , 17 , 39 ] . Thus , PM tension is the in - plane tension , set by the nature of the lipids forming the bilayer and influenced by exter - nal forces acting on the PM of a cell . PM tension arises from hydrostatic or osmotic pressures from the cytosol , the forces exerted by the CSK and adhesion forces if the cells adheres to a substrate or other cells [ 15 , 17 , 39 ] . Whereas cell compression and micropipette aspiration can be used to assess cell tension [ 14 ] , the most accurate technique involves pulling PM tethers ( figure 1 a ( iii ) ) through atomic force microscopy , optical tweezers or magnetic tweezers [ 14 , 17 ] , where tension is inferred from the resistance force exerted by the tether . As extensively explained [ 14 , 17 , 19 ] , the tension measured with this set - up is an apparent tension containing the PM tension and the tension induced by adhesion to the underlying CSK , to which the PM is strongly attached . Tether experiments do not decouple them , except in measurements per - formed on PM areas detached from the CSK ( blebs ) [ 50 ] . Comparative measurements in or out of blebs have determined that the CSK often has a higher contribution to the apparent tension than the PM , pointing out the essen - tial role of CSK – PM coupling [ 17 ] . Furthermore , because of the very slow equilibration of PM tension at cellular scales when coupled to the CSK , tether measurements in such a situation are a local reporter of a possibly heterogeneous tension distribution [ 50 ] . Thus , unravelling the effects of external mechanical stimuli on the PM , decoupled from those on the CSK , is an important challenge , which may be addressable through novel molecular fluorescence sensors of PM tension [ 53 , 69 ] . Interestingly , the cell CSK generates mechanical constraints on the PM similar to those arising from external physical forces , giving rise to comparable mechanochemical responses at the PM , with interesting impli - cations in division , motility or spreading [ 3 , 8 , 14 ] . r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s t b Ph il .

In the case of shear stress , it is unclear whether the MGC responds to the shear stress itself , or to the hydrostatic pressure stretching the cellular PM . The first , bacterial channels ( large conductance mechanosensitive ion channel , McsL ) to be discovered have been extensively studied . These channels are believed to undergo a confor - mational change triggered by increased PM tension and ref . molecular response sensors G protein PLD2 PLD2 PLD2 caveolin cavins actin PI clustering do m a i n f o r m a ti on a nd p r o t e i n r ec r u it m e n t c o m p r e ss i v e s t r e ss a nd t opog r a phy c u e s c o m p r e ss i v e s t r e ss p r o t e i n r e l o ca ti on c on f o r m a ti on a l c h a ng e M G C s op e n i ng s h ea r s t r e ss c u r v a t u r e s e n s i ng ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) ( d ) mTORC2 mTORC2 mTORC2 P L D 2 r e l ea s e ca v e o l ae f l a tt e n i ng B A R unb i nd i ng actin network assembly regulation [ 15 , 22 , 84 – 98 ] [ 56 , 70 ] [ 40 , 60 , 100 – 102 ] [ 36 , 103 ] [ 11 , 14 , 105 , 106 ] [ 58 , 65 ] [ 63 , 78 , 79 , 108 – 124 , 139 , 140 ] downstreamsignalling Ca 2 + Ca 2 + Ca 2 + Ca 2 + bg a GTP GDP downstream signalling I - BAR I - BAR ALPS protein N / F - BAR N / F - BAR ALPS protein TORC2 TORC2 TORC2 TORC2 sequestering and inactivation diffusion to the cytoplasm and downstreamsignalling a bg Figure 2 .

MscL channels are believed to open slightly before the PM reaches the rupture tension under area expansion [ 15 , 22 ] , although this assumption may not be generalizable to the very different eukaryotic membranes . Eukaryotic PM channels include TRP ( transient receptor potential ) channels , potassium channels and Piezo channels [ 84 , 92 , 94 ] , which have recently raised a lot of interest [ 95 , 95 , 96 ] . Their activation may be due generally to changes in PM tension , but also changes in curvature [ 87 ] , and the tensions needed to activate them may not need to be as close to the rupture tension as previously believed [ 86 , 88 , 97 ] . Importantly , PM tensions include CSK contri - butions ( see box 2 ) , and therefore tensions needed to activate MGCs will be higher in PM regions attached to the CSK than in detached regions ( blebs ) or in proteo - liposomes lacking CSK [ 95 , 98 ] . Interestingly , whereas the important factor in PMs under stretch is generally considered to be bilayer expansion , changes in bilayer thickness may induce conformational changes by introducing a hydrophobic mis - match [ 28 ] , and even clustering effects [ 99 ] . This may lead to a broader range of transmembrane proteins sensitive to PM tensile stress . ( ii ) Protein conformational changes : response to fluidity Shear stress in the PM has been linked to G protein activation , by triggering the required conformational change . Application of a shear flow resulting in increased PM fluidity seems to allow higher G protein rotational mobility , which facilitates the GDP to GTP exchange and subsequent activation [ 70 ] ( figure 2 a ) . Shear stress also induced phosphorylation of VEGFRs ( vascular endothelial growth factor receptors ) but the actual mechanism still needs to be unravelled [ 56 ] . ( iii ) Protein relocation : caveolae Upon increased PM tension , caveolae disassemble and flat - ten , reducing and thereby buffering PM tension changes [ 40 ] . A primary consequence of caveolae flattening is to pre - vent an increase in PM tension upon stress . In terms of inducing downstream responses , PM tension buffering by caveolae could prevent MGC activation , exerting thus an indirect mechanotransduction role [ 100 ] . Beside this , caveolae disassembly facilitates the diffusion of some of their proteins ( figure 2 b ) . Indeed , upon application of hypo - osmotic treat - ment inducing a 20 % swelling , an increase in non - caveolar CAV1 ( caveolin - 1 ) and a higher population of freely diffusing CAV1 have been measured in MLEC cells [ 40 ] . Subjecting myoblasts to a single fast stretch ( 20 % uniaxial ) released the binding of CAV3 ( caveolin - 3 ) to SRC ( proto - oncogene tyro - sine - protein kinase SRC ) , enhancing SRC activation [ 60 ] . In addition to caveolin release from caveolae to the bulk PM , cavin - 1 ( caveolae - associated protein 1 ) can also be released into the cytoplasm [ 40 ] , and could subsequently interact with signalling effectors . Another protein , EHD2 ( EH - domain - containing protein 2 ) , has been recently shown to be released as a consequence of caveolae unfolding , and sub - sequently translocated to the nucleus [ 101 ] . Lipid trafficking also seems to be modified by caveolae disassembly . Interest - ingly , a decrease in sphingolipid packing was also measured upon caveolae flattening [ 60 ] , resulting in an accelerated turn - over of glycosphingolipid , which might insert more easily into the unpacked flattened caveolae . Lastly , caveolae are actively refolded upon stretch release [ 40 ] ( in an ATP - and actin - dependent manner ) but this active mechanism has not been elucidated in detail . However , it may involve a sen - sing role of a BAR ( Bin / amphiphysin / Rvs ) protein domain ( see discussion on BAR - domain proteins below ) , since PACSIN 2 ( protein kinase C and casein kinase sub - strate in neurons protein 2 ) , which contains a BAR domain , may participate in caveolae biogenesis [ 102 ] . PACSIN 2 could thereby be an initial sensor of bilayer ten - sion decrease , as well as a linker to actin through its SH3 ( Src homology 3 ) domain [ 102 ] . ( iv ) Protein relocation : unfolding of other invaginations Upon mechanical stretch ( micropipette aspiration of a PM patch at 5 kPa ) , a redistribution of Slm ( phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate - binding protein Slm ) proteins between dis - tinct PM domains has been observed in eisosomes ( folded structures ) from yeast [ 103 ] . This led to activation of TORC2 ( target of rapamicin kinase complex 2 ) and sphingo - lipid metabolism regulation . A similar mechanism was described recently in neutrophils [ 36 ] . Application of a tensile stress ( from either hypo - osmotic treatment or a 40 % radial stretch ) possibly unfolded PM invaginations leading to PLD2 ( phospholipase D2 ) release ( figure 2 b ) , subsequently activating mTORC2 ( mammalian TORC2 ) and limiting actin network assembly . Another example is that of the unfolding of PM ruffles , where MARCKS ( myristoylated alanine - rich C - kinase substrate ) proteins localize and supposedly capture PIs . Ruffle unfolding may relocate MARCKS proteins and consequently release PIs in the PM [ 104 ] . Finally , unbinding of BAR proteins ( extensively discussed in the next section ) may occur upon flattening of PM invaginations [ 11 , 14 , 105 , 106 ] ( figure 2 b ) . If accompanied by an increase in PM tension , theoretical predictions suggest that BAR protein oligomeriza - tion would become unfavourable [ 107 ] . All these phenomena may potentially be enhanced by phase separation associated with increased PM tension , leading to relocation of embedded or anchored proteins . 4 . Sensors of compressive stress and topography ( a ) Curvature sensing : Bin / amphiphysin / Rvs proteins PM deformations generated upon compression , or because of external topography , can lead to the formation of extremely curved structures that can be detected by curvature - sensing proteins ( CSPs ; figure 2 c ) . Among them , BAR - domain pro - teins are particularly relevant . Unravelling the crystal structure of AMPH ( amphiphysin ) [ 108 ] as a domain forming a banana - shaped arrangement upon dimerization , the so - called N - BAR domain , shed light on the way how such domains would act as scaffolds on top of curved lipid bilayers . Thereafter , N - BAR domains have been described as having a high intrinsic curvature , capable of sensing and inducing PM curvature . The family of BAR - domain - bearing proteins expanded to include different intrinsic curvatures , notably when crystal structures of F - BAR ( Fes / CIP4 homology - BAR ) domains ( with a shallower degree of curvature than N - BAR domains ) [ 109 ] , and subsequently I - BAR ( inverse - BAR ) domains [ 110 ] ( with an inverted curvature relative to N - BAR domains ) followed . These domains bind the acidic PM with the positive charges of the BAR domain facing the curved PM . r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s t b Ph il . T r a n s . R . S o c . B 374 : 2018022 1 7 ( b ) Curvature sensing : proteins with bilayer insertion motifs In parallel , amphipathic helix motifs are another type of curva - ture - sensing domain ( figure 2 c ) . These helices might be structured in the soluble form of the protein , or be disordered domains folding upon interaction with the lipid bilayer . As has been discovered for ARFGAP1 ( ADP - ribosylation factor GTPase - activating protein 1 ) [ 111 ] , these helices screen lipid packing defects , where they can easily be buried . Curved areas of the bilayer generate more transient defects than planar regions , giving these helices curvature - sensing capa - bilities [ 112 ] . The helix of ARFGAP1 has given the name to a family of motifs , ALPS ( amphipathic lipid packing sensors ) , but the mechanisms used by ALPS have since then been expanded to a wide range of amphipathic or hydrophobic motifs [ 113 ] . Alpha - synuclein and proteins with hydrophobic anchors ( e . g . lipidated N - terminal domains ) also sense lipid packing defects [ 114 , 115 ] , and some reports suggest that many proteins containing such motifs have curvature - sensing properties [ 63 , 115 ] . However , there might be rules restricting curvature - sensing capabilities to some hydrophobic motifs with specific properties [ 112 ] , or setting the sensed curvature size range [ 114 ] . N - BAR proteins also possess ALPS motifs , opening the debate about which motifs in the BAR super - family of proteins are in fact sensing PM curvature [ 116 ] . Several studies found that ALPS motifs , rather than the BAR domains [ 117 ] , were responsible for curvature sensing in AMPH and some F - and I - BAR proteins [ 118 – 120 ] . Some studies therefore claim that the sensing motif could be the ALPS motif only , with the driving force for its inter - action with the PM being the density of defects rather than affinity [ 120 ] . How F - BARs or I - BARs that do not contain ALPS motifs would sense curvature is unclear , but crowding effects [ 121 ] or effects from the surrounding protein back - bone [ 122 ] or the large disordered domains found in many of these proteins [ 123 , 124 ] could be involved . Most probably , the curvature sensing event is a cooperative process to which each of these domains contributes [ 125 ] . ( c ) Sensing versus inducing curvature If present at sufficiently high concentrations ( as is often the case in assays in vitro or in overexpression conditions ) , CSPs not only sense , but also induce curvature [ 112 , 116 , 126 ] . Whether sensing and inducing are always mediated by the same phys - ical mechanisms remains unclear , but theoretical models [ 80 ] suggest that curvature sensing and generation are two manifes - tations of a fundamental coupling between the bilayer free energy , the chemical potential of proteins and curvature . According to this view , sensing and generation would occur concomitantly in general and can only be uncoupled in situ - ations such as dilute or highly crowded protein coverage or fixed membrane shape . Supporting this suggestion , AMPH has been shown to sense and generate curvature [ 126 ] . Accord - ingly , the curvature - inducing effect , analysed mainly via vesicle tubulation assays of GUVs in vitro [ 108 ] , is often con - sidered as proof that the proteins are also sensors [ 80 ] . In cells , CSPs organize and remodel the PM [ 127 ] , and most studies focus on how these proteins actively induce curvature to optimize cellular functions such as endocytosis [ 128 ] . To decouple inducing from sensing effects , in vitro assays have been developed to study the sensing mechanisms only . These include assaysto analyse the sensingoftenseliposomesofdiffer - ent curvatures [ 119 , 120 ] , lipid tether assays [ 126 , 129 ] and techniques such as the use of wavy lipid bilayers [ 130 ] or mem - brane - tubes extruded from a supported lipid bilayer [ 131 ] . It is also important to note that it is more challenging to study convex than concave curved proteins , although the former can be achieved by using lipid tethers [ 132 ] . Additionally , though many simulations have been developed to describe CSP bilayer shaping mechanisms [ 132 , 133 ] , some also specifically describe sensing mechanisms [ 134 ] . In cells , CSPs may also trigger transduction to a biochemi - cal signalling cascade . CSPs usually possess additional domains that recruit other partners , and convey a biochemi - cal signal in the cell . BAR proteins localize to curved spots in the cellular PM [ 108 ] , but this does not enable us to dis - tinguish whether they sense curved PM domains or if they are recruited by another means ( via lipid binding for example ) and subsequently shape the PM , especially when overexpression of BAR proteins ( known to induce PM tubule formation [ 127 ] ) is used . The capacity of curved PM areas to recruit BAR proteins and induce mechanotransduc - tion has mostly been found in cellular processes where PM curvature is pre - existing , and not generated in response to external forces . For instance , in CME ( clathrin - mediated endocytosis ) , the endocytic bud ( generated by CSPs them - selves ) possibly recruits other CSP participating in the endocytic event [ 135 ] , although it is not clear when and whether curvature or other signals recruit these proteins [ 136 ] . During filipodia formation and retraction , invagina - tions created by PM tension release recruit the F - BAR protein FBP17 ( formin - binding protein 17 ) [ 11 ] . Similarly , ArhGAP44 ( Rho GTPase - activating protein 44 ) , an N - BAR protein , colocalizes to nanoscale deformations in neurons , inhibiting filipodia formation / exploration [ 137 ] . The N - BAR protein PICK1 ( protein interacting with C kinase - 1 ) is recruited to nanovesicles ( insulin - containing granules ) because of their high curvature [ 138 ] . Other than BAR pro - teins , ARFGAP1 , which contains an ALPS motif , is recruited to PM deformations induced by coat protein complex COPI [ 111 ] . ( d ) Curvature sensing of deformations induced by extracellular forces Other than responding to pre - existing PM curved areas , an exciting possibility is that curvature sensing is also important in the context of PM reshaping by extracellular stresses . For instance , CSPs recruit to mechanically induced curved struc - tures in bacteria [ 139 ] , and to nanocone - shaped PM invaginations created by substrate topography [ 78 , 79 ] . In the study by Zhao et al . [ 78 ] , engineering substrate topogra - phy through nanopillars of different sizes and shapes led to recruitment of CSPs of different types , from N - BAR to I - BAR . Additionally , topography - induced CSP recruitment triggered mechanotransduction by enhancing endocytosis , via the recruitment of endocytic proteins such as clathrin and DNM2 ( dynamin - 2 ) . Inspired by this method , a later study [ 140 ] used fluorescent N - BAR overexpression at low concentration to detect locations of cellular PM invaginations . As suggested by these works , endocytosis seems to be a major cell response downstream of PM mechanosensing . Recently , the CLIC - GEEC ( clathrin - independent carrier and r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s t b Ph il . T r a n s . R . S o c . B 374 : 2018022 1 8 GPI - AP enriched endosomal compartment ) endocytic path - way has been demonstrated to respond to mechanical tension [ 62 ] . The pathway found is governed by VCL ( vinculin ) acting upstream of GBF1 ( Golgi - specific brefeldin A - resistance guanine nucleotide exchange factor 1 ) , but the actual molecular sensor of the change in tension remains unknown . Two BAR proteins involved in CLIC - GEEC endocytosis and acting downstream of GBF1 / ARF1 ( ADP - ribosylation factor 1 ) , namely IRSP53 ( insulin receptor substrate protein , also known as BAIAP2 ) and PICK1 [ 141 ] , could potentially play a role . In different work , a burst in endo - cytosis mediated by the BAR protein GTPase regulator GRAF1 ( also known as ARHGAP26 , Rho GTPase - activating protein 26 ) was reported upon restoring medium tonicity after a harsh hypotonic treatment [ 105 ] , but the driving factor of GRAF1 recruitment remained unclear . The treatment also led to for - mation of VLD and subsequent recruitment of GRAF1 . However , whether the curvature of micrometre - sized VLDs matches the sensing capabilities of GRAF1 is unclear . Interest - ingly , endocytosis in both studies is mediated by accumulation of myristoylated ARF proteins . In those proteins and similarly to ALPS motifs , the myristoylated hydrophobic anchor could insert into the PM and sense curvature . Unrelatedtoendocytosis , theF - BARRhoGAPproteinSpv1 ( spermathecal physiology variant ) also has an interesting mechanosensing role in egg fertilization in Caenorhabditis ele - gans [ 106 ] . In the relaxed spermatheca , Spv1 localizes to the apical PM , inhibiting Rho1 / RhoA activity . The entry of oocytesintothespermathecastretchesspermathecacells , prob - ably unfolding and flattening Spv1 - containing microvilli , and leading to Spv1 detachment from the PM . Rho1 / RhoA activity is then promoted , inducing cell contraction and expulsion of the fertilized embryo to the uterus . In this study , it is not clearwhetherSpv1isrecruitedtoPMmicrovillithroughcurva - ture sensing or another mechanism , but it seems clear that tension increase and subsequent microvilli flattening lead to Spv1 detachment , triggering signalling [ 106 ] . Other than these examples , further curvature - sensing events and sub - sequent mechanochemical responses likely remain to be unravelled . For instance , the reservoirs we observed upon cel - lular destretch [ 31 ] might be regions for curvature - sensing - mediated mechanotransduction . ( e ) Sensing protein relocation : response to phase changes Upon decreasing PM tension , PIs cluster in invaginated PM structures in yeast [ 58 ] , possibly due to either lipid sorting or changes in lipid phases . PI clustering led to binding of the PH ( pleckstrin homology ) domain of TORC2 to the PI - enriched PM , and consequently drove TORC2 recruitment and inactivation ( figure 2 d ) . Further , the enrichment of lipid packing defects in curved L o domains upon com - pression could affect the location of anchored proteins . For instance , N - RAS ( GTPase NRas ) , which targets lipid packing defects , shows preference for L d domains on flat bilayers , but for L o domains in highly curved liposomes [ 65 ] . 5 . Theoretical modelling Much of the current understanding of the PM as a mechano - chemical transducer reviewed here is the result of close interaction between experiments and theory . Theoretical models and simulations provide a framework to rationalize and predict both ( 1 ) how mechanical stimuli affect the PM , and ( 2 ) the complex ensuing PM mechanochemistry . Regard - ing ( 1 ) , free - standing membranes are well described by classical Helfrich - like models , which consider the membrane as a continuum surface whose stable configurations minimize bending energy . This bending energy depends on the curva - ture of the surface , and is subject to constraints such as fixed volume or area ( see also box 3 ) . The mechanics of membranes adhered to deformable or active networks , however , is richer and far less explored . Continuum models have shown how the interaction between the PM and the actin CSK controls PM tension in pressurized blebbing cells [ 37 ] , in motile cells [ 142 ] or during localized membrane perturbations [ 50 ] . These works highlight how friction or heterogeneous attach - ment to the CSK leads to significant tension gradients . Continuum simulations have also established the mechan - isms by which membranes confined to deformable and possibly poroelastic substrates cope with excess area or inter - stitial fluid [ 59 , 61 ] . The PM – CSK interaction described by these continuum models ultimately depends on an intimate and dynamical coupling over multiple length scales [ 143 , 144 ] , which remains to be fully understood . Turning to membrane mechanochemistry , phase separation in model membranes has been successfully modelled using molecular dynamics ( MD ) [ 145 ] and continuum thermodynamic models , which have also described the coupling between shape and composition [ 146 , 147 ] . The coupling between phase behaviour and tension , however , remains controversial since theoretical models predict mixing upon tension increase [ 55 ] , whereas experiments suggest this and the opposite be - haviour [ 54 , 148 ] . Furthermore , theoretical models having focused on model membranes ; their applicability to the more heterogeneous and dynamical PM is unclear . Much of membrane mechanochemistry hinges on the interaction between membranes and proteins [ 132 ] . To cap - ture the specificity of these interactions , all - atom MD simulations have identified molecular mechanisms behind curvature generation [ 149 ] and maintenance [ 150 ] by BAR domains , or the gating of mechanosensitive channels by membrane tension [ 151 ] . At the expense of molecular speci - ficity , coarse - grained MD simulations [ 152 ] have been able to reach micrometre - sized domains during microseconds to understand curvature sensing and generation by large numbers of isotropic [ 153 ] or banana - shaped proteins [ 154 ] , and the tension - dependence of such processes [ 107 ] . These approaches are complementary to hybrid continuum / discrete models , which treat the membrane as a continuum elastic surface but treat individual proteins as discrete objects . Such hybrid models have examined how PM tension and elasticity control mechanosensitive channels [ 155 ] , or protein - mediated interactions between curving proteins of different shapes [ 156 , 157 ] . They have also shown that the col - lective behaviour of many channels [ 158 ] or curving proteins [ 157 , 159 ] is fundamentally multibody , highlighting a funda - mental gap between models for individual proteins and mean - field models treating proteins as concentrations [ 80 ] . The latter models couple Helfrich - like bending energies , in which the spontaneous curvature of the membrane depends on the concentration of curving proteins , with mean - field models for the free energy of the protein gas . Such mean - field models ( such as that by Flory [ 160 ] and Huggins r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s t b Ph il . T r a n s . R . S o c . B 374 : 2018022 1 9 [ 161 ] ) account for the mixing entropy of the proteins in the membrane , and the self - interaction between proteins ( see also box 3 ) . Such thermodynamic continuum models pro - vide a self - consistent description of curvature sensing , sorting [ 126 ] and generation , as well as its coupling with membrane tension [ 162 ] . Strikingly , despite the fact that these phenomena can be highly dynamical and concomi - tant , current theories have focused on equilibrium , or considered restricted dynamics with either fixed shape [ 163 ] or fixed protein coverage [ 164 ] . Looking forward , a fundamental challenge in the field is to connect models capturing protein – lipid specificity and membrane mechan - ochemistry at a mesoscale . 6 . Concluding remarks Though external mechanical forces play a crucial role in cell fate , the role of mechanochemical feedback mediated by the cellular PM remains largely unexplored . To further advance in this promising area , several aspects need to be considered . First , PM homeostasis is highly cell - dependent , and efforts need to be made to mimic physiological forces as closely as possible . Second , the respective effects of the PM and the underlying CSK need to be further clarified , as both can be sensitive to similar stimuli and can modify each other . For instance , a protein recruited to focal adhesions , Vinculin , was recently described as an early player in the endocytosis response triggered by PM compression due to stretch release [ 62 ] . Relatedly , changes in the PM order induced by cell shape have been associated with CSK reorganization [ 75 ] . In this regard , recently described molecular probes of PM tension [ 53 ] are promising tools to distinguish between these effects . Third , the respective roles and mechanisms of curvature sensing and inducing need to be further clarified . If all proteins bearing a hydrophobic anchor can sense curva - ture , this implies a future important broadening of the field , especially if a combined effect with phase transition occurs as with N - Ras recruitment to L o domains in curved lipo - somes . Fourth , this review also highlights the interplay between tension and curvature sensing , and both seem to play a role in biochemical sensing mechanisms . In addition , external forces exerted on the PM trigger molecular rearrangements such as phase changes or lipid sorting , poss - ibly affecting directly many signalling proteins [ 165 ] . Finally , many CSPs have been explored at the nanoscale , but how cells sense curvature at the microscale remains unclear [ 166 ] . Upon cellular compression , structures of very different sizes can be generated [ 31 ] , and may induce very different curvature - sensing mechanisms . To conclude , mechanotrans - duction by the cellular PM is still an emerging field , which could even have implications in other cellular membranes [ 167 ] , including the nuclear membrane [ 168 , 169 ] . Here , we explored the short - term mechanotransduction events involved . Interestingly , several of the molecular players dis - cussed ( BAR proteins [ 170 – 172 ] , TORC2 [ 173 ] , MGCs [ 174 ] Arf1 [ 175 , 176 ] and caveolae [ 177 , 178 ] ) are involved in differ - ent cancer scenarios , potentially through altered mechanical responses . However , how this occurs , and how it is linked to long - term cellular response to mechanical signals , remains as an open question and is likely to be an exciting area of research .

Box 3 . Box 3 . Theoretical definitions . ( a ) Continuum models Continuum models treat the PM as a continuous surface rather than resolving individual lipid molecules . This results in a mean field description of the response of the PM . ( b ) Continuum Helfrich model This model treats the PM as a surface whose local area cannot be easily changed ( inextensibility ) , which can shear in - plane without storing elastic energy because it is fluid , and which stores elastic energy when it is bent . Mathematically , this leads to an energy function that penalizes deviations between the local curvature of the surface and a spontaneous curvature encod - ing the bilayer asymmetry . Helfrich conceived of such a model in 1973 [ 192 ] . ( c ) Flory – Huggins model This model describes the free energy of mixtures of fluids or gases . One can imagine a simplest mixture to be binary . If the mixture consists of repelling fluid particles , a low - energy state can be devised in which particles will segregate into distinct pure phases . At finite temperature , however , the mixture will have a tendency to maximize entropy , which favours a homo - geneous mixture . In general , these two mechanisms will compete . Since the entropic response depends on the temperature , one can envision a critical temperature for repelling fluid mixtures beyond which the mixture would be homogeneous , while the phases are separated for temperatures below the critical temperature . Such a model was conceived by Flory and Huggins in the 1940s [ 160 , 161 ] to describe the behaviour of a mixture of polymers and has hence been used to predict the response of various kinds of mixtures . When applied to protein gases on fluid membranes , curvature modifies the energy required to place a protein molecule in a given membrane location ( its chemical potential ) , which can lead to protein - rich curved domains in conditions where a planar membrane would remain homogeneously mixed . r o y a l s o c i e t y pub l i s h i ng . o r g / j o u r n a l / r s t b Ph il .
