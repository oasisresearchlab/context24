MTSS1 is important for cell morphology , motility , metastasis . The role of MTSS1 in cell morphology has been widely investigated in non - neuronal tissues ; however the role of MTSS1 in neurite outgrowth remains unclear . Here we investigated the eﬀect of MTSS1 on neurite outgrowth in primary cerebellar granule and hip - pocampal neurons of mouse . We found that overexpression of MTSS1 in cerebellar granule neurons signiﬁcantly enhanceddendriteelaborationbutinhibitedaxonelongation . This phenotype was signiﬁcantly reduced by deletion of the Wiskott – Aldrich homology 2 ( WH2 ) motif and point mutation in the insulin receptor substrate p53 ( IRSp53 ) and MIM / MTSS1 homology ( IMD ) domain . Furthermore , inhibition of Rac1activityorblockingofphosphatidylinositolphosphates ( PIPs ) signaling decreased the eﬀect of MTSS1 markedly . In accordance with the over - expression data , knockdown of MTSS1incerebellargranuleneuronscouldincreasetheaxonlengthbutdecreasethedendritelengthandthenumberof dendrites . In addition , MTSS1 knock down in embryonic hippocampal neurons suppressed neurite branching and reduced dendrite length .

INTRODUCTION The actin cytoskeleton plays important role in the neuronal morphogenesis and structural plasticity ( Luo , 2002 ; Tojima and Ito , 2004 ; Bouquet and Nothias , 2007 ; Cingolani and Goda , 2008 ) . The dynamic assembly of local actin cytoskeleton and its interaction with the plasma membrane determine the morphogenesis of neurons ( Luo , 2002 ; Tojima and Ito , 2004 ; Bouquet and Nothias , 2007 ) . The actin - binding proteins could regulate cytoskeleton remodeling through sequestration of actin monomers , actin nucleation and polymerization , capping or crosslinking of actin ﬁlaments ( Winder and Ayscough , 2005 ; Uribe and Jay , 2009 ; Lee and Dominguez , 2010 ) . Furthermore , the signals originating from plasma membrane could be transmitted to the underlying actin cytoskeleton through small GTPase and phospho - inositides and inﬂuence the actin organization ( Saarikangas et al . , 2010 ; Hall and Lalli , 2010 ; Croise´ et al . , 2014 ) . MTSS1 is an actin - and membrane - binding protein with roles in cell morphology , carcinogenesis , metastasis and development ( Lee et al . , 2002 ; Machesky and Johnston , 2007 ; Xie et al . , 2011 ) . It con - tains a C - terminal actin monomer binding Wiskott – Aldrich homology 2 ( WH2 ) motif and an N - terminal IRSp53 and MIM homology ( IMD ) domain , also known as a Bin / amphi - physin / Rvs ( BAR ) domain ( Mattila et al . , 2003 , 2007 ; Yamagishi et al . , 2004 ) . The IMD domain facilitates ﬁbrous actin bundling , activates Rac1 - actin - related protein - 2 / 3 complex mediated lamellipodia formation and induces membrane tubulation as reported for other BAR domains ( Yamagishi et al . , 2004 ; Bompard et al . , 2005 ; Mattila et al . , 2007 ) . Over - expression of MTSS1 in diﬀerent cell types induces Cdc42 - independent ﬁlopodia - like structures , lamellipodia - like structures and loss of stress - ﬁber structures ( Gonzalez - Quevedo et al . , 2005 ; Bompard et al . , 2005 ; Mattila et al . , 2007 ; Machesky and Johnston , 2007 ) . MTSS1 is ubiquitously expressed during development and becomes more restricted in adulthood . In the central nervous system ( CNS ) , MTSS1 is strongly expressed in developing neurons whereas in adulthood MTSS1 is highly expressed in limited areas of hippocampus and cerebellum ( Mattila et al . , 2003 ; Glassmann et al . , 2007 ; Shi et al . , 2012 ; Saarikangas et al . , 2015 ; http : / / mouse . brain - map . org / experiment / show ? id = 1777 ) . In addition , it is distributed throughout the cell body , axon and dendrites ( Hayn - Leichsenring et al . , 2011 ; Shi et al . , 2012 ; Saarikangas et al . , 2015 ) . The morphological function of MTSS1 in non - neuronal tissues is well described ( Machesky and Johnston , 2007 ; Xie et al . , 2011 ) , but its role in neuronal morphogenesis is http : / / dx . doi . org / 10 . 1016 / j . neuroscience . 2016 . 07 . 002 0306 - 4522 / (cid:1) 2016 IBRO .

Neuroscience 333 ( 2016 ) 123 – 131 123 not so clear . Gonzalez - Quevedo et al . have speculated that morphogens Shh may cooperate with receptor tyro - sine phosphatase - delta to control motor neuron morpho - genesis through MTSS1 during spinal cord development ( Gonzalez - Quevedo et al . , 2005 ) . They also observed that MTSS1 over - expression could induce special actin - based cell projections in Neuro - 2a neuroblastoma cells ( Gonzalez - Quevedo et al . , 2005 ) . Glassmann et al . and our previous study suggested that the transient develop - mental expression of MTSS1 in cerebellar granule neu - rons and Purkinje neurons closely parallels their migration and neuritogenesis respectively ( Glassmann et al . , 2007 ; Shi et al . , 2012 ) . Evidence suggests that MTSS1 may be involved in shaping the membranes of cerebellar Purkinje neurons in vivo ( Hayn - Leichsenring et al . , 2011 ) . Recently , Saarikangas et al . found that MTSS1 might promote dendritic spine initiation through phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 bisphosphate ( PIP2 ) - mediated membrane bending to ensure proper synaptogenesis ( Saarikangas et al . , 2015 ) . With view to the strong expres - sion of MTSS1 between the postnatal 7 days and 21 days in the cerebellum , we speculated that MTSS1 might be also involved in the development of axon and dendrite ( Glassmann et al . , 2007 ; Hayn - Leichsenring et al . , 2011 ; Shi et al . , 2012 ) . Here , we examined the role of MTSS1 in the neurite outgrowth of primary neurons . Wild - type MTSS1 overexpression promoted dendrite elaboration but inhibited axonal extension in cerebellar granule neurons , whereas WH2 and IMD mutants did not . Inhibition of Rac1 activity and the use of phosphatidylinositol 3 - kinase inhibitor reversed the eﬀects of MTSS1 on dendrite and axon extension . Depletion of MTSS1 by shRNA in cerebellar granule neurons led to increased axon length but decreased dendrite length and the number of dendrites . Similarly , in hippocampal neurons , the knock - down of MTSS1 signiﬁcantly reduced dendritic arborization . Our ﬁndings suggest that MTSS1 plays an important role in neurite outgrowth , which requires the activation of Rac1 and PIPs signaling pathway .

Yu et al . / Neuroscience 333 ( 2016 ) 123 – 131 ﬁre - polished Pasteur pipettes . Cells were re - suspended in ice - cold Ca 2 + & Mg 2 + free PBS with DNase I and sub - jected to a two - step Percoll gradient in Ca 2 + & Mg 2 + free PBS with EDTA . The cells accumulating at the interface between the 35 % and 60 % Percoll phases was collected . After washing with Basal Medium Eagle twice , the cell pel - let was re - suspended in Basal Medium Eagle with 0 . 6 % glucose and transferred onto anti - ganglioside GD3 mono - clonal antibody ( R24 , aﬃnity puriﬁed from the supernatant of hybridoma ATCC No . HB - 8445 ) coated dishes . After incubation for 45 min at 35 . 5 (cid:4) C for further removal of glial cells , the non - adherent cells were harvested and plated in the poly - lysine coated dishes or coverslips in half horse serum and half B27 serum - free medium . At day in vitro ( DIV ) 1 , the cerebellar granule neuron cells were transfected with FuGENE (cid:3) HD and the medium were changed to B27 serum free medium except for LY294002 related experiment . For LY294002 related experiments , the cells were cultured in half horse serum and half B27 serum free medium all the time to decrease the harmful eﬀect from LY294002 . After transfection for 24 h , LY294002 ( ﬁnal concentration of 40 l M ) was added and incubated overnight . At DIV3 , the cells were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for immunoﬂuorescence study except for knock down assay . For knock down - related experiments , the cells were ﬁxed at DIV4 . Primary hippocampal neuron culture and transfection Primary mouse hippocampal neurons were isolated from Kunming mouse embryos at embryonic day 18 as described previously ( Chen et al . , 2006 ) . For any single hippocampal neuron culture experiment , 2 pregnant ani - mals were used . Experiments were performed from three separate culture preparations . Hippocampal were dis - sected and the meninges were removed thoroughly . Iso - lated hippocampal were pooled and dissociated with 0 . 125 % ( v / v ) trypsin digestion at 37 (cid:4) C for 3 min and tritu - ration with a ﬁre - polished Pasteur pipette . The cells were seeded onto poly L - lysine - coated glass coverslips in half horse serum and half B27 serum - free medium . At DIV1 , the cells were co - transfected with GFP and pSuper - Negative - control , or pSuper - MTSS1 - RNAi - 1 , or pSuper - MTSS1 - RNAi - 2 at DIV1 , and the medium were changed to B27 serum - free medium after transfection . Then the cells were ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS for immunoﬂuorescence study at DIV4 . The transfected cells were identiﬁed by GFP staining . Measurement of endogenous Rac1 activity Recombinant GST - PAK1 - PBD were puriﬁed and immobilized on glutathione - Sepharose beads according to manufacturer’s instructions . Neuro - 2a cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modiﬁed Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum . Cells were grown to 85 % conﬂuency and transfected with pEGFP - N1 or pEGFP - N1 - MTSS1 plasmids , or without transfection ( as blank ) . After 48 h , the cells were rinsed with PBS and harvested with ice - cold lysis buﬀer ( 50 mM Tris – HCl , pH 7 . 5 , 500 mM NaCl , 2 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 10 % glycerol , 1 % NP - 40 , 10 mM NaF , 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 0 . 1 mM PMSF , and 10 l g / ml aprotinin and leupeptin ) . Cell lysates were centrifuged for 5 min at 16 , 000 g at 4 (cid:4) C and each supernatant was incubated ﬁrstly with 20 l g of puriﬁed GST immobilized on glutathione - Sepharose beads at 4 (cid:4) C for 4 h , then centrifuged for 5 min at 8000 g at 4 (cid:4) C . The pelleted GST beads were washed three times with ice - cold PBS and saved whereas the supernatant were further incubated with 20 l g of puriﬁed GST - PAK1 - PBD immobilized on glutathione - Sepharose beads at 4 (cid:4) C for overnight . After washing three times with ice - cold PBS , the bound proteins were solubilized in 2 (cid:2) SDS sample buﬀer and separated on 12 % SDS – PAGE .

Immunoblotting For western blot , mouse primary cells were lysed in SDS sampling buﬀer at boiling temperature for 5 min , then separated on 10 % SDS – PAGE and proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane . For endogenous MTSS1 level related experiments , the membrane was blotted with MTSS1 antibody and then with GAP43 antibody as loading control ; For LY294002 related experiments , the membrane was blotted with p - AKT ( pSer473 ) antibody , Pan - AKT antibody , and GAP43 antibody .

Quantitation and statistical analysis To quantify relative levels of protein expression in western blot analysis , images were also analyzed by Bio - Rad Quantity One 1D - Analysis software . For endogenous MTSS1 level - related experiments , the band intensities were normalized to the levels of GAP43 . For LY294002 - related experiment , the levels of phosphorylated AKT were normalized to the amount of total AKT . Values were expressed as mean ± SEM from three independent experiments . Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired , two - tailed Student’s t - test . J . Yu et al . / Neuroscience 333 ( 2016 ) 123 – 131 125 Statistical analyses and basic graphical delineation for bands used Sigma Plot 10 . 0 ( San Jose , CA , USA ) . The diﬀerence was considered statistically signiﬁcant when P - value was less than 0 . 05 . For ﬂuorescence statistics , dendrite length and axon length were quantiﬁed manually using NIH ImageJ software . For quantiﬁcation of dendrite elongation in cerebellar granule neurons and hippocampal neurons , only neurites longer than 10 l m were calculated . The number of the primary dendrites and the secondary dendrites per cell were manually counted . Statistical analyses used Friedman’s test followed by a nonparametric rank - based two - way ANOVA test for multiple comparison . The statistical data have been corrected for multiple comparisons . Values were expressed as mean ± SEM . The diﬀerence was considered statistically signiﬁcant when P - value was less than 0 . 05 . RESULTS Overexpression of MTSS1 signiﬁcantly reduces axon length but enhances dendritic elaboration in cerebellar granule neurons MTSS1 expression in cerebellar granule neurons becomes more restricted as development progresses ( Shi et al . , 2012 ) . In cultured postnatal cerebellar granule neurons , the MTSS1 antibody we used detected two bands . The signal of upper band was stronger than that of lower band . For upper band , there were signiﬁcant increases at DIV3 , DIV4 and DIV5 ( p < 0 . 05 vs . DIV0 ) ( Fig . 1A ) . For lower band , MTSS1 expression peaked at DIV5 ( p < 0 . 01 vs . DIV0 ) and decreased slightly at DIV6 ( p < 0 . 05 vs . DIV0 ) ( Fig . 1A ) . To explore the morphological role of MTSS1 in neuron , cerebellar granule neurons were transfected with a pEGFP - N1 - MTSS1 or control pEGFP - N1 plasmid at DIV1 and neuronal morphology was analyzed at DIV3 . Axon extension was signiﬁcantly perturbed by MTSS1 overexpression ( p < 0 . 001 vs . GFP only ) and the growth and elaboration of dendrite arbors was notably increased , leading to a higher overall dendritic length ( p < 0 . 001 vs . GFP only ) and dendritic number ( p < 0 . 001 vs . GFP only ) ( Fig . 1B ) . To determine the importance of the C - terminal WH2 and N - terminal IMD domains in neurite elongation of cerebellar granule neurons , we used IMD and WH2 mutant constructs . As shown in Fig . 1B , WH2 deletion mutant was still able to perturb axon extension ( p < 0 . 001 vs . GFP only ) but to lesser extent when compared with wild - type MTSS1 ( p < 0 . 05 vs . MTSS1 ) . Furthermore , overexpression of WH2 deletion mutant could not aﬀect the dendrite length and the number of dendrites ( p > 0 . 05 vs . GFP only ) ( Fig . 1B ) . These ﬁndings suggest that the WH2 domain contributes importantly to MTSS1 - mediated neurite extension in cerebellar granule neurons . The IMD mutant was also able to inhibit axon extension in cerebellar granule neurons ( p = 0 . 001 vs . GFP only ) , but to a lesser extent than wild - type MTSS1 ( p < 0 . 001 vs . MTSS1 ) ( Fig . 1B ) . Similar to that of the WH2 mutant , the IMD mutant was able to abolish the eﬀect of MTSS1 overexpression on dendritic arborization almost completely ( p > 0 . 05 vs . GFP only ) ( Fig . 1B ) . Interestingly , the total dendrite length in neurons overexpressing the IMD mutant was even shorter than that of control cells ( p < 0 . 01 vs . GFP only ) ( Fig . 1B ) , indicating a dominant negative eﬀect of the IMD mutant on dendrite extension in cerebellar granule neurons . Inhibiting Rac1 activity signiﬁcantly reduces MTSS1 - mediated neurite elaboration in cerebellar granule neurons The small GTPase Rac1 plays an important role in neurite outgrowth , axonal guidance and neuronal migration ( Luo et al . , 1996 ; Govek et al . , 2005 ; de Curtis , 2008 ) . To determine whether Rac1 is involved in MTSS1 - mediated neurite outgrowth , a dominant - negative ( DN ) Rac1 ( T17N ) mutant was used to inhibit endogenous Rac1 activity . Overexpression of DN Rac1 decreased the length of the axon ( p < 0 . 001 vs . GFP only ) and the dendrites ( p < 0 . 05 vs . GFP only ) , but had no eﬀect on dendrite number ( Fig . 2 ) . Furthermore , co - transfection of DN - Rac1 with MTSS1 - GFP could diminish the MTSS1 - induced inhibition of axon extension ( p < 0 . 05 vs . MTSS1 only ; p > 0 . 05 vs . GFP + DN - Rac1 group ) and the eﬀect of MTSS1 on the length and number of dendrites ( p > 0 . 05 vs . GFP + DN - Rac1 group ) ( Fig . 2 ) . We speculate that Rac1 plays an important role in the MTSS1 - mediated regulation of neuronal morphol - ogy , particularly in the elaboration of dendrites . MTSS1 overexpression has been reported to increase Rac1 activity in COS - 7 cells ( Bompard et al . , 2005 ) . To determine whether MTSS1 aﬀects neuronal morphology by activating Rac1 , we performed pull - down assays in Neuro - 2a neuroblastoma cells transfected with either MTSS1 - GFP or GFP plasmid . GTP - bound Rac1 was obtained by pull - down assay and quantiﬁed as a measure of endogenous Rac1 activity . Transfection of the pEGFP - N1 plasmid had no obvious eﬀect on the endogenous Rac1 activity compared to un - transfected cells ( p > 0 . 05 vs . Blank ) ( Fig . 3 ) . However , a signiﬁcantly higher amount of GTP - bound Rac1 protein was detected following the over - expression of MTSS1 - GFP in Neuro - 2a cells compared to pEGFP - N1 - transfected cells ( p < 0 . 05 ) or un - transfected cells ( p < 0 . 01 ) ( Fig . 3 ) . This suggests that MTSS1 might activate Rac1 to inﬂuence neurite extension and growth . Phosphoinositol - 3 - kinase inhibitor diminishes MTSS1 - mediated neurite extension in cerebellar granule neurons The IMD domain of MTSS1 can induce membrane invagination in the presence of PIP2 ( Mattila et al . , 2007 ) . Recently , Saarikangas et al . suggested that phos - phatidyl inositol phosphates ( PIPs ) are critical for MTSS1 - plasma membrane interaction ( Saarikangas et al . , 2015 ) . We examined whether PIP - mediated plasma membrane invagination contributes to the changes in MTSS1 - induced neuronal morphology using phosphoinositol - 3 - 126 J . Yu et al . / Neuroscience 333 ( 2016 ) 123 – 131 kinase inhibitor LY294002 . Due to the apoptotic eﬀect of LY294002 at high concentration on the cerebellar granu - lar neuron , the concentration of 40 l M was used in this study . Inhibiting eﬀect of LY294002 at this concentration was tested by detecting phosphorylated AKT level . As shown in Fig . 4A , the pAKT ( pSer473 ) level was signiﬁ - cantly decreased ( p < 0 . 01 vs . (cid:3) LY294002 ) . After treat - ing with LY294002 for 24 h following MTSS1 overexpression , the neuronal morphology was analyzed . The eﬀects of MTSS1 overexpression on axon length , dendrite length and the number of dendrites were com - pletely abolished by LY294002 treatment ( p > 0 . 05 vs . GFP + LY294002 group for all three factors ) ( Fig . 4B ) . These ﬁndings indicate that PIPs signaling is necessary for MTSS1 - mediated neurite extension in cerebellar gran - ule neurons . MTSS1 knock - down increases axon length but inhibit dendrite elaboration in cerebellar granule neurons To further examine the eﬀect of MTSS1 on the neurite outgrowth , shRNA - mediated knock - down was performed in cerebellar granule neurons . pEGFP - N1 and pSuper - negative control vectors or pSuper - MTSS1 - RNAi vectors Fig . 1 .

Yu et al . / Neuroscience 333 ( 2016 ) 123 – 131 127 were co - transfected transiently into the cerebellar granule neurons and the cell morphology was analyzed at DIV4 . Axon length was substantially extended in MTSS1 knock - down cells compared to controls ( Fig . 5 ) . Quantiﬁcation of axon length conﬁrmed a signiﬁcant increase by MTSS1 shRNA - 1 and shRNA - 2 ( p < 0 . 001 vs . nonspeciﬁc shRNA for both shRNA ) and there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the eﬀect of MTSS1 shRNA - 1 and shRNA - 2 ( p > 0 . 05 ) . Both MTSS1 shRNAs were also able to signiﬁcantly perturb the number of dendrites ( p < 0 . 001 vs . nonspeciﬁc shRNA for both MTSS1 shRNA ) and decrease the total dendrite length for each neuron ( p < 0 . 001 vs . nonspeciﬁc shRNA for MTSS1 shRNA - 1 ; p < 0 . 01 vs . nonspeciﬁc shRNA for MTSS1 shRNA - 2 ) . In addition , there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the eﬀect of MTSS1 shRNA - 1 and shRNA - 2 on the number of dendrites and dendrite length ( p > 0 . 05 ) ( Fig . 5 ) . MTSS1 knock - down reduces dendritic complexity in hippocampal neurons The cultured cerebellar granule neurons have very simple dendritic structure and few of them could develop secondary dendrite at DIV4 . To further examine the eﬀects of MTSS1 on the dendritic branching , shRNA - mediated knock - down was performed in hippocampal neurons . MTSS is highly expressed in the developing central nervous system whereas in the adulthood , it is expressed at limited area of cerebellum and hippocampus ( Mattila et al . , 2003 ; Shi et al . , 2012 ; Saarikangas et al . , 2015 ; http : / / mouse . brain - map . org / experiment / show ? id = 1777 ) . Compared with that of cerebellar granule neuron , the cultured embryonic hip - pocampal neurons at developing stage have complex dendrite structure with multiple branches , which might fur - ther reveal the role of MTSS1 in regulating dendritic mor - phology under knock down condition . In cultured embryonic hippocampal neurons , the MTSS1 antibody we used detected two bands as observed in the postnatal cerebellar granule neurons . The upper band has a peak around DIV4 ( p < 0 . 05 vs . DIV 0 ) while the lower band peaked around DIV20 ( p < 0 . 001 vs . DIV 0 ) ( Fig . 6A ) . Fig . 3 .

Yu et al . / Neuroscience 333 ( 2016 ) 123 – 131 To investigate the role of MTSS1 in dendrite extension in hippocampal neurons , we performed shRNA - mediated knock - down of MTSS1 . pEGFP - N1 and pSuper - negative control vectors or pSuper - MTSS1 - RNAi vectors were co - transfected transiently into hippocampal neurons and the cell morphology was analyzed at DIV4 . Dendritic arborization was substantially reduced in MTSS1 knock - down cells compared to controls ( Fig . 6B ) . Quantiﬁcation of dendrite length conﬁrmed a signiﬁcant reduction by MTSS1 shRNA - 1 and shRNA - 2 ( p < 0 . 001 vs . nonspeciﬁc shRNA for MTSS1 shRNA - 1 ; p < 0 . 01 vs . nonspeciﬁc shRNA for MTSS1 shRNA - 2 ) and there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the eﬀect of MTSS1 shRNA - 1 and shRNA - 2 ( p > 0 . 05 ) . Both MTSS1 shRNAs were also able to signiﬁcantly perturb the number of primary and secondary dendrites ( for primary dendrites and secondary dendrites : p < 0 . 001 vs . nonspeciﬁc shRNA for both MTSS1 shRNA ) . In addition , there was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the eﬀects of MTSS1 shRNA - 1 and shRNA - 2 on the number of dendrites ( p > 0 . 05 ) . These ﬁndings provided further evidence that MTSS1 is important for neurite outgrowth in vitro . DISCUSSION The importance of MTSS1 in cell morphology and tumor metastasis has been well described . However , despite the dynamic expression of MTSS1 in neuronal tissues , the functional role of MTSS1 in the CNS has not yet Fig . 5 . MTSS1 knock - down in cerebellar granule neurons increase the axonal length and reduces the number of dendrites . Primary cerebellar granule neurons were co - transfected with GFP and pSuper - Negative - control , or pSuper - MTSS1 - RNAi - 1 , or pSuper - MTSS1 - RNAi - 2 at DIV1 and cells were ﬁxed at DIV4 .

Yu et al . / Neuroscience 333 ( 2016 ) 123 – 131 129 been explored . Neuronal development is dependent upon the controlled extension of neurites , which involves dynamic changes of the neuronal membrane and underlying cytoskeleton . In this study we have demonstrated that MTSS1 plays an important role in neurite outgrowth in vitro . As a cytoskeletal scaﬀolding protein , MTSS1 is important for cell morphology , motility and polarity ( Machesky and Johnston , 2007 ; Yu et al . , 2011 ; Saarikangas et al . , 2011 ; Xie et al . , 2011 ) . Overexpression of MTSS1 in diﬀerent cell lines causes a range of phenotypes , including microspikes , ﬁlopodia - like or lamellipodia - like structures and loss of stress ﬁbers ( Machesky and Johnston , 2007 ) . The importance of the IMD and WH2 domains for cytoskeletal regulation is well deﬁned ( Machesky and Johnston , 2007 ; Mattila et al . , 2007 ) , although the IMD mutant appears to exhibit a more striking phenotype than the WH2 mutant ( Gonzalez - Quevedo et al . , 2005 ) . Similarly , in this study , the WH2 mutant produced a weaker phenotype than IMD mutant , especially with regard to the total dendrite length . However , the contribution of WH2 domain to MTSS1 - mediated morphological change in this study is obvious . This implies that the binding of actin monomers by WH2 is important for MTSS1 - altered cell shape in neuron . In agreement with previous ﬁndings in non - neuronal cells , the IMD domain was essential for the MTSS1 - induced membrane protrusion and even had a dominant negative eﬀect on the dendrite length . Interestingly , IRSp53 , which shares a highly homologous IMD domain with MTSS1 , also signiﬁcantly enhances neurite outgrowth and neu - ronal branching ( Lim et al . , 2008 ; Crespi et al . , 2012 ; Chen et al . , 2015 ) . This may be mediated by the IMD domain or Cdc42 - IRSp53 - mediated ﬁlopodia formation ( Govind et al . , 2001 ; Krugmann et al . , 2001 ; Yamagishi et al . , 2004 ) . The small GTPases Rho , Rac and Cdc42 play important roles in dendritic arborization and axon guidance ( Threadgill et al . , 1997 ; Govek et al . , 2005 ; Vadodaria and Jessberger , 2013 ; Stankiewicz and Linseman , 2014 ) . In agreement with previous studies , we found that overexpression of dominant active Rac1 modulate neurite outgrowth in cerebellar granule neurons ( data not shown ) and that MTSS1 could activate Rac1 in Neuro - 2a cells ( Fig . 3 ) ( Threadgill et al . , 1997 ; Gallo and Letourneau , 1998 ) . This indicates that MTSS1 may mod - ulate neuronal morphology by regulating Rac1 activity . The local production of PIP2 is essential for neurite outgrowth and morphogenesis ( Yin and Janmey , 2003 ; Meiri , 2004 ; Logan and Mandato , 2006 ) . Binding of PIPs , most likely PIP2 , to the IMD domain of MTSS1 is essential for MTSS1 - mediated membrane deformation , morpho - genesis and the initiation of dendritic spine ( Mattila et al . , 2007 ; Saarikangas et al . , 2015 ) . Our study has shown that this is also true for neurite outgrowth in neu - rons ; not only were PIPs essential for MTSS1 - mediated neurite outgrowth , but the IMD mutant had a dominant negative eﬀect on dendrite extension . However , the underlying mechanism remains unclear as the critical residues for Rac1 binding , ﬁbrous actin binding and mem - brane deformation overlap in the IMD domain ( Yamagishi et al . , 2004 ; Bompard et al . , 2005 ; Mattila et al . , 2007 ) , not to mention the complexity of Rho GTPase / phosphoinosi - tide signaling networks in neurons . Interestingly , two isoforms of MTSS1 have been found in cerebellum , which resulted from a switch in MTSS1 splicing in the progress of neuronal diﬀerentiation . The immature granule neuron and non - neuronal tissues express a MTSS1 variant comprising exon 12 whereas this exon is replaced by a CNS - speciﬁc exon , 12a , in more mature granule neurons and in adult Purkinje cells ( Glassmann et al . , 2007 ) . Here , two bands were detected in cerebellar granule neuron culture and hippocampal neuronal culture . However , according to the molecular weight diﬀerence , we think that it is not likely to be resulted from the splicing variance but from glycosylation or sumolyation . It will be interesting to know whether these two bands may play diﬀerent function . In conclusion , we have shown that MTSS1 regulates neurite outgrowth and dendritic arborization in primary neurons in vitro . We have provided evidence that MTSS1 acts through a Rac1 - and PIP - dependent pathway . Nevertheless , the role of MTSS1 in neuronal morphogenesis in vivo and further elucidation of the underlying mechanism still needs to be addressed .
