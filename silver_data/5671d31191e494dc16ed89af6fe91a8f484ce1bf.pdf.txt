Cyr ¶ and Todd R . Graham * Background : In eukaryotic cells , clathrin - coated vesicles transport specific cargo from the plasma membrane and trans - Golgi network to the endosomal system . Removal of the clathrin coat in vitro requires the uncoating ATPase Hsc70 and its DnaJ cofactor auxilin . To date , a requirement for auxilin and Hsc70 in clathrin function in vivo has not been demonstrated . Results : The Saccharomyces cerevisiae SWA2 gene , previously identified in a synthetic lethal screen with arf1 , was cloned and found to encode a protein with a carboxy - terminal DnaJ domain which is homologous to that of auxilin . Like auxilin , Swa2p has a clathrin - binding domain and is able to stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsc70 . The swa2 - 1 allele recovered from the original screen carries a point mutation in its tetratricopeptide repeat ( TPR ) domain , a motif not found in auxilin but known in other proteins to mediate interaction with heat - shock proteins . Swa2p fractionates in the cytosol and appears to be heavily phosphorylated . Disruption of SWA2 causes slow growth and several phenotypes that are very similar to those exhibited by clathrin mutants . Furthermore , the swa2 D mutant exhibits a significant increase in membrane - associated or - assembled clathrin relative to a wild - type strain . Conclusions : These results indicate that Swa2p is a clathrin - binding protein required for normal clathrin function in vivo . They suggest that Swa2p is the yeast ortholog of auxilin and has a role in disassembling clathrin , not only in uncoating clathrin - coated vesicles but perhaps in preventing unproductive clathrin assembly in vivo . Background Clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) are involved in eukaryotic intracellular trafficking of proteins and lipids by both recep - tor - mediated endocytosis from the plasma membrane and sorting from the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) to the endoso - mal system . Clathrin is a multimeric coat protein composed of three heavy chains and three light chains , which trimerize at the carboxyl termini of the heavy chains to form three - legged triskelia that self - associate into a polyhedral basket . Assembly of the clathrin lattice on the TGN or plasma membrane is thought to drive membrane deformation as the clathrin coat encapsulates the budding transport vesicle [ 1 ] . Once formed , the clathrin coat must be shed before the vesicle can fuse with its target membrane . The process of CCV uncoating in vitro is mediated by the 70 kD heat - shock cognate protein ( Hsc70 or Hsp70 ) along with its cofactor auxilin [ 2 ] . Auxilin is a member of the DnaJ family of enzymes , which have been reported to assist Hsc70 in its various activities such as protein folding , protein trans - port across membranes , and selective disruption of protein – protein interactions [ 3 – 5 ] . Auxilin has a clathrin - binding domain that recruits Hsc70 to clathrin whereas the J domain is responsible for stimulating the ATPase activity of this chaperone [ 6 ] . As Hsc70 disassembles clathrin from the CCV , the clathrin triskelia can recycle for further rounds of vesicular transport . Association of auxilin with clathrin is transient , whereas Hsc70 appears to remain asso - ciated with the free triskelia and may prime them for proper reassembly [ 7 ] . Although the biochemical function of auxilin has been well defined , the relative importance of the role of auxilin , or even of Hsc70 , in clathrin function has not been defined in vivo . Tetrameric adaptor proteins ( APs ) are a major constituent of CCVs and are known to link clathrin to selected cargo proteins that span the vesicle membrane [ 8 , 9 ] . CCVs budding from the TGN carry AP - 1 whereas those budding from the plasma membrane carry AP - 2 [ 10 ] . Even though AP - 1 is required in vitro for recruitment of clathrin to Golgi membranes , the simultaneous deletion of multiple adaptor subunits in yeast has no apparent effect on clathrin function in vivo [ 11 , 12 ] . This surprising observa - tion underscores the importance of combined biochemical and genetic approaches to understanding the basic mecha - nisms of clathrin assembly and disassembly .

Research Paper 1349 The small GTP - binding protein ADP - ribosylation factor ( ARF ) is also required in vitro for recruitment of AP - 1 / clathrin coats as well as coatomer ( COPI ) to Golgi membranes [ 13 ] . In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , ARF is encoded by the essential gene pair ARF1 and ARF2 . These genes are functionally redundant but ARF1 is more highly expressed and accounts for 90 % of the cellular ARF protein [ 14 ] . We previously carried out a genetic screen designed to identify factors that might function in ARF - dependent protein transport pathways . Seven com - plementation groups ( SWA1 – SWA7 ) were identified for which mutant alleles are synthetically lethal with arf1 D , a genetic interaction implicating these gene products in the same , or a parallel , pathway with ARF . This is the only genetic screen in yeast that has uncovered a mutant allele of the clathrin heavy chain ( chc1 - 5 / swa5 ) , and as such pro - vided the first genetic evidence for ARF involvement in clathrin function [ 15 ] . We have also implicated the inte - gral membrane , P - type ATPase Swa3 / Drs2p in clathrin function at the yeast TGN [ 16 ] . In this report , we impli - cate Swa2p in clathrin function and suggest that Swa2p is the auxilin ortholog in S . cerevisiae . This provides the first evidence that an auxilin - like protein is essential for clathrin function in vivo . Results SWA2 is allelic to YDR320C The SWA2 gene was cloned by complementation of the synthetic lethal interaction between swa2 - 1 and arf1 D ( see Materials and methods ) . To determine if YDR320C is allelic to SWA2 , we cloned the YDR320C gene from the swa2 - 1 mutant by gap - rescue ( as described in Materials and methods ) and tested if this gene carried a mutation that caused the swa2 mutant phenotype . If YDR320C was a suppressor gene rather than SWA2 , we would expect that the gap - rescued gene would have a wild - type sequence and would still suppress the swa2 mutant upon retransfor - mation . However , we found that YDR320C cloned from the swa2 - 1 mutant was unable to suppress or complement the swa2 - 1 mutant strain and carried a single point muta - tion that resulted in a glycine to arginine change at amino acid 388 ( G388R ) of the encoded protein ( Figure 1b ) . As a control , the YDR320C gene was gap - rescued from the parental wild - type strain and sequenced . As expected , this gap - rescued gene had a wild - type sequence and com - plemented the swa2 - 1 mutant . Thus , YDR320C is allelic to SWA2 and the G388R mutation causes the swa2 - 1 mutant phenotype . Swa2p contains TPR , DnaJ and clathrin - binding domains A BLAST search for proteins homologous to Swa2p indi - cated that the protein of known function that is most similar to Swa2p is auxilin . In fact , a BLAST search of the yeast genome identified YDR320C / Swa2p as the yeast protein with the highest similarity to auxilin . The homol - ogy is only observed between the carboxy - terminal 67 amino acids of Swa2p and the J domain of auxilin , but the sequences in this region are 39 % identical ( Figure 1a , b ) . This region of Swa2 also shows weaker similarity to the J domain of many proteins in this family and contains the invariant HPD motif , which is necessary for the function of the J domain in stimulating Hsc70 ATPase activity [ 17 ] . Expression of auxilin is restricted to neuronal cells [ 18 ] ; however , the non - neuronal form of auxilin appears to be cyclin G - associated kinase , or GAK , which contains a protein kinase domain at the amino terminus and auxilin - related sequences at the carboxyl terminus [ 19 , 20 ] . The J domain of GAK also shows significant homology to the Swa2p DnaJ domain ( Figure 1b ) . In addition , the region of Swa2p extending from amino acid 374 – 517 showed weak but significant similarity to the 1350 Current Biology Vol 10 No 21 Figure 1 Domain map of Swa2p .

The TPR motif appears to be a pro - tein – protein interaction module and in several proteins it is known to mediate association with the highly conserved carboxy - terminal residues of Hsp70 or Hsp90 proteins [ 21 ] . For example , the Hsp70 / Hsp90 organizing protein ( Hop ) contains different TPR motifs that specifically bind Hsp70 or Hsp90 . Moreover , the crystal structure of these TPR motifs from Hop complexed with carboxy - terminal peptides from the appropriate Hsp has recently been reported [ 22 ] . The TPR domain in Swa2p is more similar to the Hsp70 - binding TPR1 domain of Hop1 and this alignment , overlaid with the structural elements of Hop1 , is shown in Figure 1b . The protein with greatest similarity to Swa2p is an uncharacterized ORF from Schizosaccha - romyces pombe , which also contains a TPR domain and DnaJ domain in the same relative position as found in Swa2p , and so the Schizosaccharomyces sequence is also shown in the alignment ( Figure 1b , SchP ) . The functional significance of the TPR domain in Swa2p is exemplified by the fact that the swa2 - 1 mutation was mapped to a conserved glycine residue in this domain ( G388R , Figure 1b ) . This glycine residue in Hop1 is within a b turn between helices 1A and 1B , which are amphipathic helices that associate along their hydrophobic surfaces [ 22 ] . The corresponding sequences in Swa2p are also predicted to be amphipathic helices . Thus , the G388R mutation may perturb a b turn structural element and consequently the interaction between helices 1A and 1B of the Swa2 TPR domain , or perhaps interaction of the b turn with another protein . The clathrin - binding domain in auxilin has been mapped to a region near the middle of this protein ( amino acids 547 – 813 ) [ 6 ] that bears no significant sequence similarity to any region of Swa2p , or any protein encoded by the yeast genome . To test if Swa2p has a functionally similar domain and can bind yeast clathrin , a recombinant GST – Swa2 fusion protein , or GST ( glutathione - S - transferase ) alone , was prebound to glutathione – Sepharose and incu - bated with yeast cytosol . The recombinant proteins and any associated yeast proteins were recovered by low - speed centrifugation , subjected to SDS – PAGE and the pellet ( P ) and supernatants ( S ) were immunoblotted for the clathrin light chain . As seen in Figure 2a , GST alone pulled down a low background level of clathrin whereas the GST – Swa2 fusion protein pulled down more than one - third of the clathrin in the cytosolic fraction . To determine if the TPR and / or J domains of Swa2p were responsible for clathrin association , GST – Swa2 proteins carrying the G388R mutation in the TPR domain ( GST – Swa2 - 1p ) or a complete deletion of the TPR and J domains ( GST – Swa2 D C ) were also prepared and tested in this binding assay . Both mutant forms of Swa2p bound clathrin as efficiently as the intact protein ( Figure 2a ) . The GST – Swa2 fusion proteins , but not GST alone , also bound to clathrin in a detergent - solubilized , high - speed membrane pellet fraction with comparable efficiency , as measured by blotting with anti - heavy chain or anti - light chain antibodies ( data not shown ) . Thus , the TPR domain is not responsible for clathrin binding but rather , Swa2p has a distinct clathrin - binding domain that maps to the amino terminus of this protein ( Figure 1a ) . Considering the similarity of Swa2p to auxilin , the interaction with clathrin is likely to be direct . However , we cannot rule out the possibility that another protein bridges this interaction . The presence of the TPR and J domains in Swa2p sug - gests that this protein should associate with a heat - shock protein and stimulate its ATPase activity . To test this , we Research Paper Role for Swa2p in clathrin function Gall et al . 1351 Figure 2 Different domains of Swa2p are required for clathrin interaction and stimulation of the Hsp70 ATPase activity . ( a ) The amino terminus of Swa2p interacts with clathrin in yeast cell extracts . GST , GST – Swa2 , GST – Swa2 - 1 ( G388R ) and GST – Swa2 D C fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione – Sepharose and incubated with yeast cytosol as described [ 48 ] . The fragment of Swa2p contained in the GST – Swa2 D C fusion protein is shaded dark gray in Figure 1a . The beads were pelleted , washed and equivalent portions of the pellet ( P ) and supernatant ( S ) fraction were subjected to SDS – PAGE and immunoblotted with anti - clathrin light chain antibodies . Each of the fusion proteins containing Swa2 sequences efficiently pulled down clathrin , mapping the clathrin - binding domain within the amino - terminal 287 amino acids of Swa2p . ( b ) Swa2p stimulates the ATPase activity of yeast Hsp70 . The ATPase assay was carried out for 15 min as previously described [ 49 ] using the ATPase buffer ( 50 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 50 mM KCl , 2 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM DTT , 0 . 3 mg / ml BSA ) and 0 . 37 m M Hsp70 ( Ssa1p ) and 44 m M GST , GST – Swa2 , GST – Swa2 - 1 or GST – Swa2 D C as indicated . Ssa1p was purified as previously described [ 24 ] .

Yeast Ssa1p was chosen because this protein has been shown to uncoat mam - malian CCVs [ 23 ] . As expected , GST alone had no effect on the heat - shock protein ATPase activity , but addition of GST – Swa2 caused a nearly 20 - fold increase in the ATPase activity ( Figure 2b ) . Whereas the GST – Swa2 - 1 protein was still capable of stimulating the Hsp70 ATPase , the GST – Swa2 D C protein was not . Thus , the carboxy - ter - minal end of Swa2p containing the TPR and J domain is responsible for the stimulatory activity . On the basis of previous studies with auxilin [ 2 ] and other DnaJ proteins [ 24 ] , it is likely that the Swa2p J domain alone is sufficient for stimulating the Hsp70 ATPase . Swa2p is a cytosolic phosphoprotein To characterize Swa2p expressed in yeast , we have pre - pared polyclonal antibodies against the recombinant GST – Swa2 protein . Swa2p is predicted to have a molecular mass of 75 kDa and these antibodies detected a ~ 75 kDa band in a lysate from the wild - type strain ( Figure 3a ) . This protein was not present in a strain harboring a deletion of swa2 ( D ) ( described below ) and was clearly more abundant in a strain overexpressing SWA2 from a multicopy plasmid ( 2 m ) ( Figure 3a ) . Thus , the 75 kDa band represents Swa2p . To determine the subcellular localization of Swa2p , wild - type and swa2 D cells were lysed and centrifuged at 10 , 000 g to pellet large membrane structures ( P10 ) . The super - natant was centrifuged at 150 , 000 g to pellet Golgi mem - branes , endosomes and vesicles ( P150 ) . An equivalent portion of each pellet fraction and the resulting 150 , 000 g supernatant ( S150 ) were immunoblotted for Swa2p . In this experiment , a closely spaced triplet of bands migrating at 74 . 8 , 72 . 5 and 71 . 8 kDa were observed in the lysate sample from wild - type cells . The 71 . 8 kDa band was also observed in the lysate from the swa2 D strain and thus represents a background band . This background band fractionated in the P10 sample from both wild - type and swa2 fractions . The 74 . 8 and 72 . 5 kDa proteins correspond to the Swa2 protein and fractionated in the S150 ( cytosol ) fraction . A single band corresponding to Swa2p was observed when lysates were prepared by boiling cells in SDS ( see , for example , Figure 3a ) , but two bands were often observed when cells were lysed in buffers that preserved protein structure ( see , for example , Figure 3b ) . Like auxilin , the clathrin - binding domain of Swa2p is extremely rich in serine and threonine , suggesting that this doublet might reflect phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms of Swa2p . To test this , the S150 sample was treated with l protein phosphatase in the presence or absence of phos - phatase inhibitors ( Figure 3c ) . Treatment with phos - phatase caused the 74 . 8 kDa band to shift to the mobility of the 72 . 5 kDa band , whereas the additional presence of phosphatase inhibitors prevented this mobility shift . These data indicate that Swa2p is a phosphoprotein with the 72 . 5 kDa band representing the dephosphorylated form . Disruption of swa2 causes slow growth and mislocalization of late Golgi proteins Two independently isolated swa2 mutants were recovered in the arf1 synthetic lethal screen . Neither mutant dis - played a slow - growth phenotype . We had , however , only characterized mutants that grew well in the ARF1 ARF2 genetic background ( for example , mutant swa2 - 1 ARF1 ARF2 ) but were inviable in the arf1 D ARF2 background ( for example , mutant swa2 - 1 arf1 D ARF2 ) . To determine the phenotype of strains carrying more severe loss - of - func - tion SWA2 alleles , we have characterized a strain carrying a deletion of the entire open reading frame ( ORF ) ( swa2 D : : Kan r ) and a strain where most of the ORF , includ - ing the TPR and J domains , was disrupted ( swa2 D : : TRP1 ) . These strains are both viable but grow much more slowly than their respective wild - type strains ( Figure 4 ) and even more slowly than isogenic chc1 D and clc1 D strains ( data not shown ) . The swa2 D mutants are viable at 15° and 37°C but 1352 Current Biology Vol 10 No 21 Figure 3 Swa2p is a cytosolic phosphoprotein . ( a ) Specificity of the anti - Swa2 antibodies . Whole - cell lysates of LSY01 ( D ) , SEY6210 ( WT ) and SEY6210 pYES2 / GS YDR320C ( 2 m ) , prepared by glass bead lysis and boiling in SDS – PAGE sample buffer , were resolved by SDS – PAGE ( 0 . 5 OD equivalents per lane ) and immunoblotted using anti - Swa2 antibodies . ( b ) Cells from strains BY4742 ( wild type ) and BY4742 swa2 D : : Kan r ( swa2 D ) were converted to spheroplasts and lysed in buffer A as described previously [ 16 , 50 ] , with omission of the RNase A incubation . The lysates ( L ; 12 . 5 OD equivalents / ml ) were centrifuged for 10 min at 10 , 000 g to generate the P10 pellet , and the supernatant was centrifuged for 90 min at 150 , 000 g to generate the P150 pellet and S150 supernatant fractions . The pellets were resuspended in the original volume of lysis buffer and an equal portion of each sample was immunoblotted for Swa2p . ( c ) The S150 sample ( 20 m l ) from the wild - type strain was treated with 400 units of l protein phosphatase ( New England Biolabs ) for 60 min , in the presence or absence of phosphatase inhibitors ( 5 mM Na 3 VO 4 , 50 mM NaF ) . The samples were resolved on a lower percentage gel to improve separation and immunoblotted for Swa2p .

Thus , SWA2 is not essential and both swa2 alleles recovered in our genetic screen represent partial loss - of - function mutations . If Swa2p has an important role in clathrin function in vivo , we would expect the swa2 D mutant to exhibit mutant phe - notypes that are comparable to clathrin mutants . One hall - mark of clathrin - deficient yeast strains is the mislocaliza - tion of late Golgi enzymes required for proteolytic maturation of pro - a - factor , such as Kex2p , which results in secretion of the unprocessed high molecular weight pre - cursor form rather than the mature form [ 25 ] . To examine pro - a - factor transport and modification in the secretory pathway of the swa2 D mutant , these cells were pulse - labeled for 5 minutes with 35 S - labeled amino acids and chased for times indicated in Figure 5a . Aliquots of cells from each time point were converted to spheroplasts by enzymatic removal of the cell wall and pelleted to gener - ate intracellular ( I ) and extracellular ( E ) fractions . For comparison , wild - type , drs2 / swa3 D and clathrin light chain disrupted ( clc1 D ) strains were subjected to the same pulse - chase regimen . a - Factor was then recovered from each sample by immunoprecipitation and subjected to SDS – PAGE . The drs2 / swa3 D , wild - type and clc1 D samples have been described previously [ 16 ] . Here , we present the swa2 D samples with the same wild - type and clc1 D controls . At the beginning of the chase , labeled a - factor was present throughout the secretory pathway of the cells as indicated by the presence of the core glycosylated ER form , the hyperglycosylated Golgi forms , and the mature form which is packaged into vesicles for secretion . In wild - type cells , complete proteolytic processing of pro - a - factor occurred within 5 – 15 minutes and most of the mature a - factor was secreted and degraded in the extracellular space . In con - trast , the clc1 D cells were deficient in the proteolytic pro - cessing of pro - a - factor and most of the high molecular weight precursor was secreted into the extracellular space within 15 minutes , as previously reported ( [ 26 ] , and Figure 5a , lane 18 ) . Similarly , the swa2 D mutant secreted the hyperglycosylated pro - a - factor and partially proteolyzed a - factor forms into the extracellular space ( Figure 5a , lanes 10 , 12 ) . These results indicate that late Golgi function in the Kex2 - dependent proteolytic processing of pro - a - factor is dramatically perturbed in the swa2 D cells . It is important to note that glycosylation of pro - a - factor in the early Golgi and the kinetics of secretion are not significantly perturbed in either the swa2 D or clc1 D mutant ( Figure 5a ) . The data shown in Figure 5a strongly suggest that Kex2p , and perhaps other late Golgi proteins , are mislocalized Research Paper Role for Swa2p in clathrin function Gall et al . 1353 Figure 4 Disruption of the SWA2 gene causes a slow growth phenotype .

Controls are reproduced from [ 16 ] with permission . ( b ) Mislocalization of an Mnn1 – invertase fusion protein ( M39I ) to the plasma membrane of the swa2 D mutant . Strains SEY6210 ( wild type ) , LSY01 ( swa2 D ) and LSY93 . 1 ( clc1 D ) expressing M39I were grown at 30°C to 0 . 5 – 1 . 0 OD / ml . The percentage of M39I at the cell surface was determined by invertase assay as previously described [ 28 ] . In wild - type cells , most of M39I is localized to the Golgi complex whereas the mutants mislocalize a significant percentage to the plasma membrane .

To directly assess the localization of a late Golgi protein , we transformed the swa2 D , clc1 D and wild - type strains with a construct expressing an Mnn1 – invertase fusion protein ( M39I ) . Like the trans / TGN glycosyltransferase Mnn1p , the M39I fusion protein is retained in the Golgi complex of wild - type cells and is partially mislocalized to the cell surface when clathrin is disrupted [ 27 , 28 ] . The percentage of M39I expressed on the surface of these cells was determined by a quantita - tive invertase assay and , as shown in Figure 5b , the swa2 mutant mislocalized M39I to the same extent as the clathrin mutant . Delayed kinetics of endocytosis and vacuolar protein transport in swa2 Disruption of yeast clathrin does not cause a complete inhibition of endocytosis , but does cause a strong kinetic delay in this process [ 29 ] . To examine protein transport through the endocytic pathway of swa2 D cells , we followed the turnover of the aa - factor plasma membrane receptor , Ste3p , which is constitutively endocytosed and delivered to the yeast vacuole where it is degraded [ 30 ] . A Myc - tagged Ste3p was expressed from a galactose - regulated promoter [ 30 ] in wild - type and swa2 D cells growing in galactose medium . New Ste3p synthesis was shut off by shifting the cells to glucose , and the disappearance of Ste3 – Myc was followed over time by immunoblotting . In wild - type cells , Ste3 – Myc was rapidly degraded , as this protein was cleared from the plasma membrane and deliv - ered to the vacuole ( Figure 6 , wild type ) . In contrast , the rate of Ste3 – Myc turnover was substantially slower in the swa2 D cells ( Figure 6 , swa2 D ) . As the rate of protein trans - port through the swa2 D secretory pathway is unperturbed ( Figure 5a ) , the slow turnover of Ste3 – Myc is probably caused by a defect in endocytosis . As expected , swa2 D cells cultured in glucose did not express Ste3 – Myc , indicating that glucose repression of the GAL promoter was not per - turbed ( data not shown ) . To determine if the samples shown in Figure 6 were loaded equally from each time point , we probed the same western blot with antibodies to the vacuolar protein car - boxypeptidase Y ( CPY ) . Each sample contained roughly an equal amount of CPY ; therefore , the differences observed in Ste3 – Myc abundance over time were not caused by inequities in sample loading . Because protein transport is so rapid , only the mature ( or vacuolar ) form of CPY is observed in the samples from the wild - type strain . However , a small amount of the Golgi - modified p2 pre - cursor form of CPY is apparent in the swa2 D samples , indi - cating that a portion of p2 CPY was either mislocalized , or that CPY transport to the vacuole is delayed . From other pulse - chase experiments ( data not shown ) , we observed a modest two - to threefold slower rate of transport of CPY from the Golgi complex to the vacuole and no mislocaliza - tion of the p2 precursor form with the swa2 D mutant . Loss of Swa2p causes an accumulation of assembled clathrin If Swa2p is involved in disassembling clathrin oligomers to produce free triskelia , we would expect the swa2 D mutant to have a decreased amount of free triskelia in the cytosol with a corresponding increase in assembled or membrane - associated clathrin . To determine if this is the case , wild - type and mutant cells were lysed and centrifuged at 13 , 000 g to pellet large membrane structures ( P13 ) . The supernatant ( S13 ) was centrifuged at 150 , 000 g to pellet Golgi membranes , vesicles and any assembled clathrin baskets ( P150 ) . An equal amount of protein from each pellet fraction and the resulting 150 , 000 g supernatant ( S150 ) , which should contain the free clathrin triskelia , were subjected to SDS – PAGE . The top portion of the gel was immunoblotted with antibodies to the clathrin heavy chain and the bottom portion was stained with Coomassie blue as a sample loading control ( Figure 7a ) . From wild - type cells , we consistently found that a significant portion of the clathrin fractionated in the S150 , indicating that it was unassembled or primarily free triskelia . In contrast , clathrin was absent in the S150 and nearly all of it fraction - ated in the P150 fraction from the swa2 D mutant . No other significant difference in the pattern of bands in these frac - tions was noted in the Coomassie stained gel . Therefore , the swa2 mutant exhibits a defect in maintaining a normal equilibrium of assembled and unassembled clathrin . Interestingly , clathrin is observed in the S150 when swa2 D cells are grown at 33°C or higher ( data not shown ) . This suggests that induction of heat - shock proteins at higher temperatures may partially suppress this phenotype , a possibility that we are currently testing . The accumulation of assembled clathrin is precisely what would be expected in a mutant that was unable to uncoat 1354 Current Biology Vol 10 No 21 Figure 6 The swa2 D mutant exhibits a defect in endocytosis . Strains SEY6210 ( wild type ) and LSY01 ( swa2 D ) harboring pSL2624 ( Gal - regulated Ste3 – Myc ) were grown to early log phase in YP galactose to induce expression of Ste3 – Myc . Glucose was added to 3 % final concentration to repress new synthesis of Ste3 – Myc and lysates were prepared at the times indicated from equal aliquots of cells . The lysates were subjected to SDS – PAGE and immunoblotted using the 9E10 anti - Myc antibody . The kinetics of Ste3 – Myc degradation in this assay reflects the rate of endocytosis [ 30 ] . CPY is the loading control . m denotes the mature form of CPY , p2 , the precursor . Current Biology Ste3 – Myc CPY p2m swa2 D Wild type 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 Time in glucose ( h ) 0 CCVs . To determine if the P150 fraction contained CCVs , P150 samples from the swa2 mutant and the wild - type strain were further resolved on a Sephacryl S1000 gel fil - tration column and fractions from the clathrin peaks were examined by electron microscopy . The elution profiles of clathrin from the column were similar between the wild - type and swa2 samples ( data not shown ) , and were also similar to the profiles shown previously for drs2 / swa3 D and wild - type samples [ 16 ] . The peak clathrin fractions from both wild - type and swa2 D cells contained vesicles that appear to be clathrin coated ( Figure 7b , arrowheads ) . In contrast to the vesicle profiles observed in Figure 7b , com - parable fractions from the drs2 / swa3 D mutant contained primarily empty clathrin baskets and lattices [ 16 ] . The loss of clathrin from the cytosol fraction and its con - comitant increase in the high - speed pellet fraction sug - gested that the swa2 D mutant might accumulate CCVs . To test this , we examined thin sections of the swa2 D mutant by electron microscopy . A significant accumula - tion of abnormal membrane structures and fragmentation of vacuoles was observed in the swa2 D mutant strain ( data not shown ) . The abnormal membrane structures were similar in appearance to those that accumulate in clathrin heavy chain ( chc1 / swa5 ) or drs2 / swa3 mutants [ 16 ] , and probably represent abnormal Golgi cisternae or endo - somes . While vesicles were apparent in the swa2 D mutant , they did not appear to accumulate significantly . Discussion Mammalian auxilin is a neuronal Hsc70 cofactor that binds clathrin , stimulates the Hsc70 ATPase activity , and is required to uncoat CCVs in vitro [ 2 , 6 ] . The non - neuronal form of auxilin appears to be cyclin G - associated kinase ( GAK or auxilin 2 ) , which has the same sequence features and biochemical properties as auxilin , with the addition of an active protein kinase domain at the amino terminus [ 19 , 20 ] . Overexpression of a GFP – GAK construct in HeLa cells causes a redistribution of clathrin and a defect in the endocytosis of transferrin [ 20 ] . Thus , overexpression of the auxilin - like protein GAK can interfere with clathrin func - tion in vivo , but this does not indicate whether the presence of an auxilin - like protein is necessary for clathrin function in vivo . We report here that the yeast auxilin - like protein Swa2p is essential for clathrin function in living cells . It is likely that Swa2p is the auxilin ortholog in S . cerevisiae as Swa2p is the closest homolog to auxilin in the yeast genome , and because Swa2p exhibits similar biochemical properties , such as the ability to bind yeast clathrin and stimulate the ATPase activity of Hsp70 ( Ssa1p ) . However , we have not yet been successful in uncoating yeast CCVs in vitro using recombinant GST – Swa2p and purified Ssa1p ( Hsc70 ) . This may reflect additional requirements in the yeast system for other cofactors in this reaction , or perhaps for phosphorylation of Swa2p . In this regard , it is interesting to note that the kinase domain of GAK is most similar in sequence to the yeast Ark1 and Prk1 kinases . GAK can phosphorylate the medium adaptor subunit of AP - 1 and AP - 2 [ 20 ] , and yeast Ark1 and Prk1 have been implicated in endocytosis through phosphorylation of the yeast Eps15 - like protein Pan1p [ 31 ] . Swa2p is a phospho - protein and we are currently testing whether Ark1 and / or Prk1 control phosphorylation of Swa2p . Auxilin is also a phosphoprotein [ 32 ] , as are clathrin [ 33 ] , adaptins [ 34 ] and several other proteins implicated in endocytosis . Gaining a better understanding of the role of protein phosphoryla - tion in regulating clathrin dynamics is an important goal in this field . We have implicated Swa2p in clathrin function by demon - strating a physical association with clathrin and by showing that swa2 exhibits a set of mutant phenotypes that , to our knowledge , is only shared by clathrin mutants . Research Paper Role for Swa2p in clathrin function Gall et al . 1355 Figure 7 The swa2 D mutant accumulates clathrin in a membrane - associated or assembled form . ( a ) Strains SEY6210 ( wild type ) and LSY01 ( swa2 D ) were grown at 24°C , lysed and subjected to subcellular fractionation as described for Figure 3 , except that the low - speed centrifugation was done at 13 , 000 g for 10 min and a portion of this supernatant ( S13 ) was saved for analysis . Equal amounts of protein ( 2 m g ) from each fraction were resolved by SDS – PAGE and the upper portion of the gel was immunoblotted for the clathrin heavy chain ( Chc1p ) . The lower portion of the gel was stained with Coomassie blue to control for sample preparation or loading discrepancies ( stained ) . While clathrin from wild type cells is split between the P150 and S150 fractions , clathrin from the swa2 mutant fractionates completely in the P150 fraction . ( b ) The subcellular fractionation was repeated on a larger scale , starting with ~ 1500 ODs of cells , and the P150 samples from each strain were further resolved over a Sephacryl S1000 column as previously described [ 16 ] . The S1000 fractions containing the clathrin peak for each sample ( fraction 26 ) were prepared for electron microscopy as previously described [ 16 ] . This fraction from both strains contains vesicles that appear to be clathrin coated . The scale bars represent 0 . 05 m m . L P 13 S 13 P 150 S 150 L P 13 S 13 P 150 S 150 Current Biology Chc1p ( b ) Stained swa2 ∆ Wild type ( a ) Of particular importance is that swa2 mutants , like clathrin mutants , secrete unprocessed pro - a - factor and mislocalize a late Golgi protein to the plasma membrane . This is a very specific phenotype that strongly supports a role for Swa2p in clathrin function . It appears that disruption of clathrin function at both the Golgi complex and in the internalization step of endocytosis is needed to see loss of localization for late Golgi proteins and subsequent accu - mulation at the plasma membrane . For example , Vps1 is a dynamin - related large GTPase that is required for late Golgi protein retention but does not seem to be involved in the internalization step of endocytosis [ 35 , 36 ] . The vps1 mutant mislocalizes late Golgi proteins to the cell surface , but they are rapidly endocytosed and fail to accu - mulate significantly on the plasma membrane [ 35 ] . Like - wise , the late Golgi fusion protein used in this study , M39I , fails to accumulate significantly on the plasma membrane of vps1 mutants ( B . Hopkins and T . R . G . , unpublished observations ) . The accumulation of M39I on the plasma membrane of swa2 D cells suggests a defect in the internalization step of endocytosis and we have also observed a defect in the endocytosis of the Ste3 pheromone receptor . Although a number of other yeast mutants have been identified that exhibit endocytosis defects [ 37 , 38 ] , they do not appear to mislocalize late Golgi proteins . In addition , many late Golgi proteins , such as Kex2p , appear to cycle between the late Golgi and endosomes and several vps mutants ( for example , vps5 , 17 , 26 , 27 , 29 , 30 and 35 ) appear to perturb the endo - some - to - Golgi retrieval pathway . These vps mutants secrete some unprocessed pro - a - factor and the vacuolar protein CPY , but they mislocalize late Golgi proteins to the vacuole rather than the plasma membrane [ 39 , 40 ] . Other phenotypes caused by SWA2 mutations that less directly link Swa2p to clathrin function include partial loss - of - function mutations in clathrin or Swa2 that are both synthetically lethal with arf1 D . This genetic interac - tion suggests that Swa2p is involved in a vesicle - mediated protein transport event , and our arf1 synthetic lethal screen appears to be biased towards uncovering mutations that perturb clathrin function . Also , both swa2 and the chc1 - 5 allele isolated in the arf1 D synthetic lethal screen have similar effects on CPY transport to the vacuole . These mutants do not secrete CPY but they do slow the rate of transport from the Golgi complex to the vacuole . Lastly , the clathrin and swa2 mutants both accumulate abnormal membrane structures ( observed by EM ) that probably represent late Golgi cisternae and / or endosomes . How does Swa2p affect clathrin function ? The swa2 D mutants have no effect on the stability of clathrin and so the phenotypes we have observed are not caused by a loss of clathrin . The similarities between Swa2p and auxilin in their ability to bind clathrin and stimulate Hsp70 ATPase activity suggested that the swa2 D mutants would accumu - late clathrin in an assembled state at the expense of free triskelia . This is precisely what we have observed . Clathrin assembled on vesicles or in lattices or baskets will pellet at 150 , 000 g , whereas free triskelia remain in the supernatant . When wild - type yeast cells are lysed and sub - jected to differential centrifugation , clathrin is comparably enriched in both the high - speed pellet and supernatant . This suggests that an equilibrium is established between assembled and unassembled states of clathrin in normal cells . In contrast , all of the clathrin fractionates in the high - speed pellet fraction from the swa2 D cells , with no detectable clathrin in the supernatant . While this pellet fraction contained CCVs , we could not determine if there was an increased number of CCVs present in the sample . The simplest interpretation of our data is that Swa2p is needed to uncoat CCVs to allow recycling of triskelia for further rounds of vesicle budding . The rather modest accumulation of vesicles in the swa2 D mutant observed by EM suggests that clathrin , or another component of CCVs that must be recycled , is limiting in supply . It is also possi - ble , however , that Swa2p is required for disassembling clathrin that has inappropriately assembled . In this case , the absence of Swa2p would cause inappropriately assem - bled clathrin lattices to accumulate at the expense of CCVs . The assembled clathrin would still pellet at 150 , 000 g , consistent with the data shown in Figure 7 , but the cells would not accumulate CCVs . A third potential explanation for the modest accumulation of vesicles is that in the absence of Swa2p , Hsc70 does not appropriately prime clathrin for subsequent assembly reactions . Further work is required to resolve these issues . The identification of an auxilin - like phosphoprotein in yeast will allow the application of molecular genetic tools available in this system to define potential regulatory mechanisms influ - encing clathrin dynamics , and to assess the in vivo role of Hsp70 in clathrin uncoating . Materials and methods Strains and media Yeast cells were grown in standard rich medium ( YPD ) , sporulation , or SD minimal media containing required supplements and 0 . 2 % yeast extract where indicated [ 41 ] . Strains used were SEY6210 ( MAT a leu2 - 3 , 112 ura3 - 52 his3 - D 200 trp1 - D 901 lys2 - 801 suc2 - D 9 ) [ 42 ] , LSY93 . 1 - 10A ( MAT a leu2 - 3 , 112 ura3 - 52 trp1 suc2 clc1 D : : HIS3 ) [ 26 ] , CCY2014 ( MAT a swa2 - 1 ura3 - 52 his3 lys2 - 801 ade2 ade3 suc2 - D 9 arf1 D : : HIS3 pCC8218 ( ARF1 - ADE3 - URA3 ) [ 15 ] , LSY01 ( SEY6210 swa2 D : : TRP1 ) , BY4742 and BY4742 swa2 D : : Kan r were purchased from Research Genetics . Cloning of SWA2 The swa2 gene was identified in an arf1 synthetic lethal screen that made use of a plasmid - based colony - sectoring assay to identify the mutants [ 15 ] . To clone SWA2 , strain CCY2014 ( swa2 - 1 ) was trans - formed with a genomic library carried on a CEN / ARS LEU2 plasmid [ 43 ] and Leu + transformants were selected on synthetic dextrose Leu – media containing 4 m g / ml adenine . After 7 – 10 days incubation at 30°C , 21 colonies that appeared to sector ( out of ~ 33 , 000 transfor - mants ) were restreaked on YPD and YPD containing 40 mM NaF . Only 1356 Current Biology Vol 10 No 21 one of these transformants sectored well on YPD and grew well on 40 mM NaF ( the parental strain , but not the swa2 - 1 mutant , grows on 40 mM NaF ) . The library plasmid ( pMH01 ) was rescued from the origi - nal transformant and was retransformed into CCY2014 . pMH01 again complemented the non - sectoring phenotype and NaF sensitivity of the swa2 - 1 mutant . Partial sequencing indicated that pMH01 contained a fragment of chro - mosome IV approximately from coordinates 1 , 096 , 800 – 1 , 108 , 950 ( Saccharomyces Genome Database , http : / / genome - www . stanford . edu / Saccharomyces / ) . This fragment contained a large Ty element and four complete open reading frames ( YDR317W - 20C ) . Deletion of a unique 3 . 03 kb Xba I fragment to produce pMH01 D XbaI , which removed YDR320C and a small portion of YDR319C , destroyed the comple - menting activity of pMH01 . The full - length YDR320C gene contained on this Xba I fragment was subcloned into Xba I - digested pRS315 [ 44 ] to produce pMH03 , which fully complemented the nonsectoring phe - notype and NaF sensitivity of the swa2 - 1 mutant . The swa2 - 1 allele was isolated by gap - rescue using pMH01 D Xba1 . This plasmid was digested with Xba I to produce the gapped plasmid , which was trans - formed into strain CCY2014 . The gap - repaired plasmid ( pMH20 ) , which carried the swa2 - 1 allele , was rescued from this strain by trans - formation into Escherichia coli and characterized as described above . The swa2 - 1 allele carried on the Xba I fragment was subcloned from pMH20 into pRS315 to produce pMH04 . The pYES2 / GS YDR320C plasmid used to overexpress Swa2p was purchased from Invitrogen . Construct preparation To prepare the swa2 : : TRP1 allele , the TRP1 gene was released from pJJ280 [ 45 ] by digestion with Pvu II and Sma I , then circularized by addition of T4 DNA ligase and subsequently digested with Bam HI . This manipulation generated a TRP1 fragment flanked by Bam HI sticky ends , which was subcloned into the unique Bgl II site of pMH03 to produce pLS03 . Introduction of TRP1 truncated the reading frame of SWA2 at codon 288 . To disrupt SWA2 , pLS03 was digested with Xba I and used to transform SEY6210 to produce strain LSY01 , which was confirmed to have the appropriate insertion by PCR . The amino - terminal fragment of Swa2p potentially produced by the swa2 : : TRP1 allele could not be detected on western blots probed with anti - Swa2 polyclonal antibodies , suggesting that it was not stable . To prepare the GST – SWA2 fusion construct , a new Bam HI site was introduced after the start codon of the SWA2 gene by PCR using forward primer ( 5 ¢ - CCGGATCCTGTCAGATCCATTTGCACATTTAC - 3 ¢ ) and reverse primer ( 5 ¢ - GTCTATCATTTGCCTCAGGTGG - 3 ¢ ) to amplify the 5 ¢ end of the SWA2 ORF . This fragment was digested with Bam HI and Bsu 36I and was gel purified . The pMH03 plasmid was then digested at its native sites with Bsu 36I and Bam HI to generate the remaining 3 ¢ end of the SWA2 gene . The PCR product and the latter SWA2 fragment were then ligated in a tripartite reaction with Bam HI - treated pGEX - 3X ( Amersham ) . A clone containing the Bam HI fragment in the appropriate orientation ( pWG01 ) , which generated an in - frame GST – SWA2 fusion , was identified by screening DNA minipreps . GST protein fused to the swa2 - 1 allele was constructed by subcloning a Bgl II – Eco RI fragment from pMH04 ( original gap - repair plasmid ) and replacing the correspond - ing restriction fragment in pWG01 to generate pWG02 . pWG03 , encod - ing GST – Swa2 D C , was constructed by carrying out a Bgl II – Eco RI restriction digest of pWG01 , filling in with T4 DNA polymerase and ligat - ing the plasmid ends to delete the Bgl II – Eco RI fragment . Antibodies The GST – Swa2p fusion protein was subjected to preparative SDS – PAGE and the band corresponding to GST – Swa2 was cut from the gel and minced . The gel fragments were used to generate polyclonal rabbit antiserum at Cocalico Biologicals . Swa2p antibodies were affin - ity purified as described [ 46 ] and used at a dilution of 1 : 10 , 000 for western blots . Antiserum to yeast pro - a - factor has been previously described [ 47 ] .

Payne ( University of California , Los Angeles ) , and the anti - clathrin heavy chain monoclonal antibodies were a gift from Sandra Lemmon ( Case Western Reserve , Cleveland ) .
