Molecular Biology of the Cell MBoC | ARTICLE The contributions of the actin machinery to endocytic membrane bending and vesicle formation ABSTRACT Branched and cross - linked actin networks mediate cellular processes that move and shape membranes . To understand how actin contributes during the different stages of endocytic membrane reshaping , we analyzed deletion mutants of yeast actin network com - ponents using a hybrid imaging approach that combines live imaging with correlative micros - copy . We could thus temporally dissect the effects of different actin network perturbations , revealing distinct stages of actin - based membrane reshaping . Our data show that initiation of membrane bending requires the actin network to be physically linked to the plasma mem - brane and to be optimally cross - linked . Once initiated , the membrane invagination process is driven by nucleation and polymerization of new actin filaments , independent of the degree of cross - linking and unaffected by a surplus of actin network components . A key transition occurs 2 s before scission , when the filament nucleation rate drops . From that time point on , invagination growth and vesicle scission are driven by an expansion of the actin network without a proportional increase of net actin amounts . The expansion is sensitive to the amount of filamentous actin and its cross - linking . Our results suggest that the mechanism by which actin reshapes the membrane changes during the progress of endocytosis , possibly adapting to varying force requirements . INTRODUCTION Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin filament networks play key roles in generat - ing and controlling force for movement and reshaping of cellular membranes ( Rotty et al . , 2013 ) . These cytoskeletal assemblies drive diverse processes such as cell motility at the leading edge , formation of lamellipodia , and generation of actin comet - tails for the intracel - lular movement of endosomes and pathogens ( Taunton et al . , 2000 ; Pollard and Borisy , 2003 ; Welch and Way , 2013 ) , as well as several endocytic uptake pathways including clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Pelkmans et al . , 2002 ; Galletta , Mooren , and Cooper , 2010 ; Collins et al . , 2011 ; Boulant , Kural , et al . , 2011 ) . These fundamental cellular functions rely on force generation by treadmilling of actin mono - mers through a dendritic actin network built from a set of conserved protein components . The network architecture and dynamics are modulated through its composition ( Svitkina , 2013 ) . Thus , actin net - work properties can adjust to meet the requirements of different processes . However , it remains poorly understood how variations in network properties control the mechanisms of force generation in cells and how the force requirements vary during actin - driven processes . Endocytosis in budding and fission yeasts is strictly dependent on Arp2 / 3 - based actin polymerization ( Kubler and Riezman , 1993 ; Moreau , Galan , et al . , 1997 ; Kaksonen , Sun , and Drubin , 2003 ; Monitoring Editor Sandra Lemmon University of Miami Received : Nov 30 , 2017 Revised : Apr 4 , 2018 Accepted : Apr 6 , 2018 This article was published online ahead of print in MBoC in Press ( http : / / www . molbiolcell . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1091 / mbc .

The process generally conforms to the den - dritic nucleation model ( Berro et al . , 2010 ; Sirotkin et al . , 2010 ) . The membrane is coupled to actin through endocytic adaptors at the tip of the invagination , while nucleation and filament elongation occur at the plasma membrane ( Kaksonen , Sun , and Drubin , 2003 ; Idrissi et al . , 2012 ; Skruzny et al . , 2012 ; Chen and Pollard , 2013 ; Berro and Pollard , 2014 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ) . Most molecular constituents of the yeast endocytic actin network have homologues in mammalian Arp2 / 3 - mediated actin networks ( Boettner et al . , 2011a ) . In this study , we aimed at understanding mechanistically how the endocytic actin network contributes throughout the process of membrane deformation and vesicle formation in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . We therefore deleted genes that encode proteins involved in coupling actin to the membrane , actin filament cross - linking , or regulation of actin nucleation . We studied these mutants using a hybrid imaging approach , which makes use of cor - relative microscopy data and of live cell imaging and particle track - ing data ( Kukulski et al . , 2011 ; 2012a ; Kukulski , Picco , et al . , 2016 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ; Picco and Kaksonen , 2017 ) . This approach pro - vides measurements of membrane morphology and actin network volume as well as high - resolution information on protein localization and assembly dynamics . We could thus observe and quantify very subtle phenotypes caused by specific actin network perturbations . Our previously published wild - type data sets served us as reference data for interpreting the results presented here ( Kukulski et al . , 2012a ; Picco et al . , 2015 ) . Our findings reveal three subsequent stages in the actin network lifetime , suggesting that different actin - based mechanisms may function during endocytic membrane shaping . RESULTS Initiation of membrane bending requires actin - membrane coupling via clathrin adaptor proteins The molecular mechanisms that cause the initial bending of the en - docytic membrane in vivo are unknown . While our previous data in - dicated that initiation of membrane invagination coincides with the assembly of actin , and inhibiting actin polymerization with latruncu - lin A prevents membrane bending at endocytic sites ( Kukulski et al . , 2012a ; Picco et al . , 2015 ) , immunoelectron microscopy data sug - gested that curvature of the endocytic membrane is induced before actin network assembly ( Idrissi et al . , 2012 ) . Indeed , endocytic adap - tor proteins could modulate membrane curvature before actin as - sembly through their membrane - binding domains or through crowd - ing , as demonstrated in vitro ( Boucrot , Pick , Camdere , et al . , 2012 ; Stachowiak , Schmid , et al . , 2012 ; Busch et al . , 2015 ; Skruzny , Desfos - ses , et al . , 2015 ) . Epsins and Sla2 ( the yeast homologue of Hip1R ) , act cooperatively to couple the membrane to the actin network via their membrane - and actin - binding domains , and are essential for endocytic vesicle formation ( Kaksonen , Sun , and Drubin , 2003 ; Sun et al . , 2005 ; Boettner et al . , 2011b ; Skruzny et al . , 2012 ) . We deleted the actin - binding domains of both Sla2 and Ent1 ( sla2 Δ THATCH ent1 Δ ACB - GFP ) to test whether the presence of the membrane binding - domains of these endocytic adaptor proteins is sufficient for initiating membrane bending when actin is assembling , but the transmission of the force from the actin cytoskeleton is uncoupled from the plasma membrane ( Skruzny et al . , 2012 ) . Fluorescence time - course imaging showed that cells carrying these mutations fail to form endocytic vesicles and coat proteins remain immobile during actin polymerization ( Skruzny et al . , 2012 ) . However , it remained unclear whether the membrane is bent at these arrested endocytic sites . By applying correlative light microscopy and electron tomog - raphy to these cells , we targeted 12 sites marked by the colocaliza - tion of GFP - labeled epsin and Abp1 - mCherry as a marker for the presence of an actin network . In all the target localizations , we found no invaginations but only flat plasma membranes associated with large cytoplasmic zones excluding ribosomes ( Figure 1A ) . The ribo - some exclusion zones correlate with the extent of the endocytic machinery , including the actin network ( Kukulski et al . , 2012a ) . In a similar experiment on cells in which the whole SLA2 gene was de - leted , all 11 target localizations of Sla1 - GFP and Abp1 - mCherry also showed flat plasma membranes associated with large exclusion zones ( Figure 1B ; Table 1 ) . In wild - type cells , ∼ 1 % of the endocytic events have a flat membrane in the presence of the actin network , while the remaining 99 % show either a membrane invagination or a vesicle ( Kukulski et al . , 2012a ) . Our results suggest that actin polym - erization and the presence of the membrane - binding coat proteins are not sufficient to induce stable membrane curvature if they are not coupled to each other . The coupling of the membrane to a po - lymerizing actin network via the actin - binding domains of Sla2 and Ent1 is thus necessary to facilitate or stabilize the initiation of the endocytic membrane invagination ( Figure 1C ) . Actin filament cross - linking is critical for the initiation of membrane bending and for reaching scission stage The composition of actin networks modulates their mechanical properties . For instance , the stiffness of actin gels decreases with a lower density of actin filament cross - linkers ( Blanchoin et al . , 2014 ) . In yeasts , the actin cross - linking activity of fimbrin has been shown to be essential for endocytic internalization ( Kubler and Riezman , 1993 ; Kaksonen , Toret , and Drubin , 2005 ; Skau et al . , 2011 ) . We perturbed actin filament cross - linking by deleting the yeast fimbrin Sac6 and studied sac6 Δ cells by live imaging and correlative micros - copy to investigate the effects on membrane invagination and vesi - cle formation . We first tracked the dynamic behavior of the coat protein Sla1 - GFP in sac6 Δ cells by live imaging with high spatiotemporal resolu - tion ( Picco and Kaksonen , 2017 ) . Sla1 is positioned close to the invagination tip and can be used to track the movement of the membrane invagination and the vesicle into the cell ( Idrissi et al . , 2008 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ; Kukulski , Picco , et al . , 2016 ) . In sac6 Δ cells , we found three distinct types of Sla1 - GFP behavior ( Figure 2A ) . The majority of Sla1 spots ( 78 . 4 ± 5 . 5 % , mean ± SE , 145 endo - cytic events in nine cells ; Figure 2A ; see Materials and Methods and Table 2 ) remained immobile at the plasma membrane until they disassembled , consistent with earlier studies ( Kaksonen , Toret , and Drubin , 2005 ; Gheorghe et al . , 2008 ) . However , 15 . 1 ± 4 . 4 % ( mean ± SE , 145 endocytic events in nine cells ) of events re - vealed distinctive behavior : The initial phase of centroid move - ment was very similar to that in wild - type cells , but ∼ 90 nm away from the plasma membrane , the centroid started to retract toward the plasma membrane ( Figure 2 , A and B ) . The remaining 6 . 5 ± 2 . 2 % ( mean ± SE , 145 endocytic events in nine cells ) of Sla1 - GFP spots were motile and moved inward , similarly to the Sla1 - GFP wild - type cells ( Figure 2 , A and C ) . To visualize the membrane morphology directly , we applied cor - relative microscopy to sac6 Δ cells expressing Sla1 - GFP and Abp1 - mCherry . In wild - type cells , the presence of these proteins marks events that span from initiation of membrane bending until disas - sembly of the actin network from the newly formed endocytic vesi - cle ( Kukulski et al . , 2012a ) . In sac6 Δ , we found that , in the presence of both Abp1 and Sla1 , as well as in the presence of Abp1 only , the 1348 | A . Picco , W . Kukulski , et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell majority of endocytic sites were flat mem - branes ( 72 and 62 % , n = 25 and 34 , respec - tively ) and the remaining ones were invagi - nations ( 28 and 38 % , n = 25 and 34 , respectively ) ( Figure 3 , A and B ) . We did not find endocytic vesicles at any of the sites , confirming that successful scission events are very rare in sac6 Δ cells . These data also support the live cell – imaging observation that the majority of the Sla1 - GFP spots re - mained immobile throughout their lifetimes . The immobile spots are thus likely to indi - cate events in which membrane bending is not initiated , despite assembly of the actin network . We then measured the lengths of the in - vaginations marked by the presence of Abp1 - mCherry and Sla1 - GFP , or by the presence of Abp1 - mCherry and absence of Sla1 - GFP , in sac6 Δ cells . We found that all the invaginations were less than 100 nm long , while in wild - type cells invaginations are up to 140 nm long ( Kukulski et al . , 2012a ; Figure 3C ) . These measurements are in agreement with the live imaging finding that most invaginations retract before reach - ing 100 nm in length ( Figure 2B ) . We also measured the curvature of in - vagination tips in sac6 Δ cells . As in wild - type cells , the tips reached a minimum radius for invaginations of ∼ 40 nm . However , the aver - age tip radius for invaginations longer than 40 nm was significantly greater in sac6 Δ cells than in wild - type cells ( sac6 Δ : 15 . 5 nm , SD 3 . 7 nm , n = 12 ; wild type : 11 . 6 nm , SD 2 . 6 nm , n = 47 ; p = 0 . 0003 ; Supplemental Figure S1 ) . Thus , either wider tips are a property of all invaginations in sac6 Δ cells , or widening of invagination tips occurs dur - ing retraction , possibly due to disassembly of coat proteins . Taken together , our results indicate that in the absence of the actin cross - linker Sac6 , FIGURE 1 : Correlative microscopy of endocytosis in cells with the actin cytoskeleton uncoupled from the plasma membrane .

Remarkably , in events that initiate mem - brane bending , elongation of the invagination appears to be unaffected until retraction occurs . In rare cases , endocytosis pro - gresses further and likely leads to successful vesicle formation . Perturbed actin nucleation in bbc1 Δ cells enhances propulsion of vesicles Arp2 / 3 - dependent nucleation of actin filaments is driven by nucle - ation - promoting factors ( NPFs ) at cellular membranes ( Pollard , 2007 ; Campellone and Welch , 2010 ) . The NPF Las17 , a yeast N - WASP orthologue , is required for actin assembly at endocytic sites , and its activity is negatively regulated by Bbc1 in vitro ( Rodal et al . , 2003 ; Sun , Martin , and Drubin , 2006 ) . At endocytic sites , Bbc1 colo - calizes with actin spots ( Kaksonen , Toret , and Drubin , 2005 ) . We per - turbed the rate of actin filament nucleation by deleting BBC1 . In bbc1 Δ cells , endocytic actin spots are brighter and the endocytic coat moves inward faster and over a longer distance than in wild - type cells ( Kaksonen , Toret , and Drubin , 2005 ) . To understand how actin nucleation in the absence of Bbc1 af - fects invagination dynamics , we first tracked Sla1 - GFP dynamics in bbc1 Δ cells . The average centroid trajectory of Sla1 - GFP in bbc1 Δ cells showed an initial movement at the same speed as in wild - type cells . About 7 s later , approximately when scission occurs in wild - type cells , Sla1 centroid movement accelerated and it moved 1350 | A . Picco , W . Kukulski , et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell deeper into the cell than in the wild type ( Figure 4A ) . We next inves - tigated the dynamics of the amphiphysin Rvs167 in bbc1 Δ cells . In wild - type cells , the peak of Rvs167 - GFP fluorescence intensity marks the scission event and coincides with a fast inward movement of the Rvs167 - GFP centroid ( Picco et al . , 2015 ) . In bbc1 Δ cells , Rvs167 - GFP showed a pronounced movement into the cytoplasm , which was concomitant with its peak in number of molecules ( Figure 4B ; Supplemental Figure S2A ) , in 85 ± 6 % ( median ± SE , 195 endocytic events in 14 cells ) of the endocytic events . Like Sla1 - GFP , motile Rvs167 - GFP spots also moved deeper into the cell cytoplasm ( Figure 4B ) . In the remaining 15 ± 6 % ( median ± SE , 195 endocytic events in 14 cells ) of events , Rvs167 - GFP spots appeared immotile . The trajectories of Sla1 - GFP and Rvs167 - GFP indicate that bbc1 Δ does not significantly affect the rate of invagination growth . How - ever , they suggest that , after scission , vesicles move deeper into bbc1 Δ cells than into wild - type cells . FIGURE 3 : Correlative microscopy of endocytosis in cells with impaired actin cross - linking .

( B ) Top row shows overlaid red , green , and blue channel fluorescence images of resin sections through yeast cells . The blue channel indicates TetraSpeck fiducial markers for correlation . White dashed circles mark endocytic sites where Abp1 - mCherry is present but Sla1 - GFP is absent , targeted by correlative microscopy . Bottom row shows virtual slices from electron tomograms at the corresponding localizations . Of n = 34 sites , 62 % displayed flat plasma membranes and 38 % showed invaginations . Scale bars are 2 µm in fluorescence images , 100 nm in electron tomography images . ( C ) The distribution of endocytic invagination lengths measured in the electron tomograms of sac6 Δ cells . The wild - type data ( Kukulski et al . , 2012a ) are shown for comparison . We then imaged Abp1 - GFP , which we used as a marker for the dynamics of the endocytic actin network ( Kaksonen , Sun , and Drubin , 2003 ) . In wild - type cells , the recruitment of Abp1 coincides with the start of the Sla1 inward movement , which marks membrane invagination ( Picco et al . , 2015 ) . In bbc1 Δ cells , the recruit - ment of Abp1 preceded the start of Sla1 - GFP inward movement by ∼ 4 s , indicating that actin assembly does not immediately lead to membrane bending . The centroid of Abp1 - GFP initially localized closer to the plasma membrane than in wild - type cells ( Figure 4C ) , suggesting a different distribution of the actin filaments on the membrane . Interestingly , the Sla1 inward movement began when the Abp1 - GFP centroid reached the same height as in wild - type cells . The endocytic actin spots are brighter in bbc1 Δ cells ( Kaksonen , Toret , and Drubin , 2005 ) . We therefore measured the number of Abp1 - GFP and Arc18 - GFP mol - ecules present at endocytic sites over time ( Joglekar et al . , 2006 ; Lawrimore et al . , 2011 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ; Figure 4D ; Supple - mental Figure S2B ; see Materials and Methods ) . Abp1 and Arc18 were recruited to the endocytic sites at the same rate as in wild - type cells ( Picco et al . , 2015 ) . How - ever , because assembly of the actin net - work in bbc1 Δ cells lasted for ∼ 5 s longer than in wild - type cells , the fully assembled network contained more Abp1 and Arc18 molecules . At the time when scission oc - curred , the number of Abp1 molecules re - cruited to the endocytic site was about doubled ( Figure 4D ) , while the number of Arc18 was ∼ 25 % larger than in wild type ( Supplemental Figure S2B ) . The Abp1 - GFP centroid in bbc1 Δ cells began moving inward at the same speed as in wild - type cells . However , the speed of the Abp1 centroid drastically increased when the invagination length reached 100 nm , ∼ 2 s before scission ( Figure 4C ) . Interestingly , while the Abp1 centroid accelerated , the assembly rate of Abp1 molecules remained unchanged and then dropped ( Figure 4D ) . We next performed correlative microscopy of bbc1 Δ cells ex - pressing Sla1 - GFP and Abp1 - mCherry , as well as bbc1 Δ cells ex - pressing Rvs167 - GFP and Abp1 - mCherry . Similarly to wild - type cells , we found endocytic invaginations and vesicles in the presence of Abp1 and Sla1 or Rvs167 , as well as in the presence of Abp1 but the absence of Sla1 or Rvs167 ( Figure 5 , A and B ) . We measured that endocytic vesicles were positioned up to 600 nm from the plasma membrane , which is significantly farther away from the plasma membrane than in wild - type cells ( bbc1 Δ : 288 . 7 nm , SD : 158 . 7 nm , n = 47 ; wild type : 129 . 5 nm , SD : 39 . 7 nm , n = 62 ; p < 0 . 0001 ; Figure 5C ) . This result is in striking agreement with the en - hanced movement of Sla1 - GFP and Rvs167 - GFP , starting around scission . Taken together , these results suggest that vesicles are Volume 29 June 1 , 2018 Actin in yeast endocytosis | 1351 being propelled faster and deeper into the cytoplasm upon dele - tion of Bbc1 . To better resolve the effects of bbc1 Δ on vesicle formation , we measured the surface areas of endocytic vesicles and compared them to the wild type . We found that vesicles in bbc1 Δ cells were on average 25 % larger ( bbc1 Δ : 7998 nm 2 , SD : 2838 nm 2 , n = 47 ; wild type : 6380 nm 2 , SD : 1929 nm 2 , n = 62 ; p = 0 . 0004 ; Figure 5D ) . The larger vesicle sizes indicate either that scission occurred when in - vaginations were longer , or that scission sites on the invaginations were positioned closer to the plasma membrane than in wild - type cells . The putative sites of scission are the necks of invaginations , which we found to be positioned similarly to those in wild - type cells ( Supplemental Figure S2C ) . However , we found that there were lon - ger invaginations in bbc1 Δ cells than in the wild type ( Supplemental Figure S2D ) , suggesting that the inward movement of the mem - brane , observed through centroid tracking of Sla1 - GFP ( Figure 4A ) , might accelerate shortly before scission , leading to longer invagina - tions that result in larger vesicles . Actin assembly occurs on a larger membrane area in bbc1 Δ cells To detail whether the increase in Abp1 molecules is accompanied by an increase in actin network size in bbc1 Δ cells , we measured the dimensions of the ribosome exclusion zones surrounding invagina - tions . We found that the volumes of exclusion zones in bbc1 Δ cells were significantly larger than those in wild - type cells ( bbc1 Δ : 0 . 0052 fl , SD = 0 . 0029 fl , n = 21 ; wild type : 0 . 0028 fl , SD = 0 . 0017 fl , n = 62 ; p = 0 . 0001 ) , which was in line with the increased numbers of Abp1 - GFP molecules that we measured by fluorescence microscopy . Inter - estingly , while the heights of the exclusion zones in bbc1 Δ corre - lated with the invagination lengths as observed in wild - type cells ( Figure 5E ; Kukulski et al . , 2012a ) , the exclusion zone diameters were independent of the stage of the invagination process and sig - nificantly larger than in wild - type cells ( Figure 5F ; bbc1 Δ : mean = 235 . 1 nm , SD = 48 . 2 nm , n = 21 ; wild type : mean = 181 . 2 nm , SD = 40 . 9 nm , n = 62 ; p < 0 . 0001 ) . Note that to compute the above val - ues , we only considered exclusion zones of bbc1 Δ invaginations below 135 nm in length , so that the invagination lengths compared with those of the wild - type population . The enlarged diameters of the exclusion zones indicate that the actin cytoskeleton is distrib - uted over a larger surface area of the plasma membrane when nu - cleation of actin is initiated . Therefore , despite the height of the actin network being comparable to that in the wild type during the invagination process , the volume of the actin network is higher . As in wild - type cells , vesicles in bbc1 Δ cells were surrounded by ribosome exclusion zones that were either connected or discon - nected to the plasma membrane ( Figure 5 , A and B ) .

( F ) The diameters of exclusion zones surrounding invaginations plotted against invagination lengths . Data from wild - type cells in C – F are from Kukulski et al . ( 2012a ) . Volume 29 June 1 , 2018 Actin in yeast endocytosis | 1353 suggested that the first case represents the earliest phase of the vesicle lifetime ( Kukulski et al . , 2012a ) . In bbc1 Δ cells , only 20 % of vesicles had exclusion zones connected to the plasma membrane , as compared with 70 % in wild - type cells . Therefore , we conclude that the density of the actin network near the plasma membrane decreases earlier in bbc1 Δ cells than in wild - type cells . This asym - metric change in density could shift the centroid of Abp1 - GFP toward the cell center , contributing to enhancing the movement of the Abp1 - GFP centroid in bbc1 Δ cells . Accumulation of Las17 drops before scission , while network expansion and movement continue in bbc1 Δ cells We next investigated the number of molecules of Las17 at the en - docytic site . Las17 is a NPF and putative target of Bbc1 ( Rodal et al . , 2003 ; Kaksonen , Toret , and Drubin , 2005 ) . Las17 accumulates on the plasma membrane , where it activates the Arp2 / 3 complex to nucleate actin filament formation ( Winter , Lechler , and Li , 1999 ; Sun , Martin , and Drubin , 2006 ) . We found that in bbc1 Δ cells , Las17 ac - cumulated over a longer time than in wild - type cells ( Figure 6 ) . In wild - type cells , the rate at which Las17 molecules accumulate de - creases after invagination growth begins . The number of Las17 mol - ecules reaches a peak of ∼ 45 molecules and then starts decreasing ∼ 2 s before scission ( Picco et al . , 2015 ) . In bbc1 Δ , however , the rate at which Las17 molecules accumulate remained high during mem - brane invagination , and the number of Las17 molecules continued to increase until it reached a peak of ∼ 80 molecules , before decreas - ing ∼ 2 s before scission as in wild - type cells ( Figure 6 ) . The assembly of the actin cytoskeleton in bbc1 Δ cells began when ∼ 40 Las17 molecules had accumulated , as in wild - type cells . Taken together , these data show that in bbc1 Δ cells , Las17 accumulation is unhin - dered and the number of accumulating Las17 molecules is larger than in the wild type , suggesting that Bbc1 is negatively regulating the assembly of Las17 . Further , the data suggest that Bbc1 is not required for triggering disassembly of Las17 . In summary , in bbc1 Δ cells , the actin network starts accumulating on a larger membrane area than in wild - type cells , resulting in higher network volumes . Nevertheless , the velocity of the actin centroid movement and the height of the exclusion zones are similar to those in wild - type cells up to ∼ 2 s before scission . In the last 2 s before scission occurs , when the accumulation of Las17 drops , the actin network centroid movement significantly speeds up . Thus , the rate and progression of the invagination process are unaffected in bbc1 Δ cells until shortly before scission . The changes in actin network be - havior seem to interfere only with the shape of late invaginations , which can become longer than in wild - type cells and therefore result in larger vesicles , and with the movement of vesicles , which are pushed farther into the cytoplasm . DISCUSSION The endocytic actin network is critical for invaginating the plasma membrane during endocytosis ( Merrifield et al . , 2002 ; Kaksonen , Sun , and Drubin , 2003 ; Boulant , Kural , et al . , 2011 ; Kukulski et al . , 2012a ) . We genetically manipulated different biochemical activities related to assembly and connectivity of the actin network to gain understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying endocytic membrane bending . On the basis of the mutant phenotypes that we studied , we can define three sequential stages in the actin network lifetime ( Figure 7 ) . The first stage corresponds to assembly of the actin network until initiation of membrane bending occurs . The second stage spans the time of invagination growth up to ∼ 100 nm , 2 s before vesicle scission . During the second stage , the numbers of Arp2 / 3 and actin molecules increase , suggesting that the growth of the invagination is driven by nucleation and polymerization of actin filaments ( Berro et al . , 2010 ; Sirotkin et al . , 2010 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ) . The third stage spans the last 2 s of the invagination and the formation of the endocytic vesicle . During the third stage , the numbers of Arp2 / 3 and Abp1 molecules reach their maxima and start to decrease . This may be because the numbers of the main NPFs , Las17 and Myo5 , decrease , leading to a reduced rate of filament nucleation and polymerization ( Picco et al . , 2015 ) , or be - cause there is an increase in actin filament severing and depoly - merization ( Chen and Pollard , 2013 ) while the polymerization rate remains unaltered , or a combination of both . Whatever the mecha - nism that controls the net amount of actin components is , the cen - troids of actin cytoskeletal proteins continue moving inward , and the actin network volume increases . These results indicate that the network expands although the number of actin components is not increasing proportionally . These observations support a model where different mechanisms of propulsion are used during the sec - ond and third stages ( Idrissi et al . , 2012 ) . Endocytosis is critically dependent on the actin - binding re - gions of the clathrin adaptors Sla2 and Ent1 ( Skruzny et al . , 2012 ) . Here we show that their actin - binding regions are impor - tant for enabling the initiation of membrane bending in yeast cells . Clathrin adaptor proteins can bend membranes in vitro ( Boucrot , Pick , Camdere , et al . , 2012 ; Stachowiak , Schmid , et al . , 2012 ; Busch et al . , 2015 ; Skruzny , Desfosses , et al . , 2015 ) but our results suggest that in yeast cells the assembly of the clathrin adaptors , when disconnected from the network of actin fila - ments , is not sufficient to stably initiate membrane bending ( Figure 7 ) . Our data do not rule out the occurrence of transient membrane bending , which may have been too unstable or rare to be captured . Indeed , shallow membrane invaginations have been observed at endocytic sites in sla2 Δ cells ( Idrissi et al . , 2012 ) . However , these results were obtained under different FIGURE 6 : Live imaging of nucleation - promoting factor in cells with perturbed actin nucleation . The number of Las17 - GFP molecules is shown over time in bbc1 Δ ( red ) and in wild - type ( black ) cells . The shadows correspond to the 95 % confidence interval . Time 0 marks the scission event , which is timed according to the peak in the Rvs167 number of molecules , when aligned in time to Abp1 ( see Image analysis and trajectory alignment ; Kukulski et al . , 2012a ; Picco et al . , 2015 ) . The wild - type data are from Picco et al . ( 2015 ) . 1354 | A . Picco , W . Kukulski , et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell experimental conditions , which may have lowered the turgor pressure inside the yeast cells and shifted a possible equilibrium between flat membranes and transient curvature toward the lat - ter ( Idrissi and Geli , 2014 ) . In sac6 Δ cells , most of the endocytic events fail to initiate the invagination process . Sac6 - mediated cross - linking of actin filaments is thus important for initial bending of the plasma membrane . In about one - fifth of the events , membrane bending is initiated and the invaginations grow normally up to ∼ 100 nm in length , which in wild - type cells corresponds to ∼ 2 s before scission ( Picco et al . , 2015 ) . The second stage is thus unaffected in sac6 Δ cells if mem - brane bending is initiated . However , the majority of invaginations in sac6 Δ cells retract and only very few events proceed through appar - ently normal scission of the vesicle . Therefore , cross - linking is likely to be important also for the expansion of the actin network , possibly by storing energy that could be released during the third stage that drives invagination growth through scission ( Ma and Berro , 2017 ) . FIGURE 7 : The actin network pulls the plasma membrane invagination in three distinct stages , which correspond to 1 ) actin network assembly until the initiation of membrane bending is achieved , 2 ) invagination growth driven by actin nucleation and polymerization , and 3 ) expansion of the actin network after the nucleation of new actin filaments has dropped 2 s before scission . The transitions between the stages are indicated by the dashed lines . ent1 Δ ACB , sla2 Δ THATCH prevents initiation of membrane bending . Likewise , sac6 Δ hinders initiation of membrane bending in the majority of cases . If membrane bending is initiated , the plasma membrane invagination proceeds until 2 s before scission and then retracts . In rare cases , invagination growth proceeds further through scission of the vesicle , as in wild - type cells . bbc1 Δ allows the plasma membrane to invaginate normally , but the actin network is larger and expands ∼ 2 s before scission . In bbc1 Δ the vesicle is propelled deeper into the cytoplasm than in wild - type cells . Interestingly , in fission yeast the number of cross - linkers per filament peaks just around the time of scission , suggesting that cross - linking might have a role in the later stage of plasma membrane invagination growth ( Berro and Pollard , 2014 ) . In the rare suc - cessful events in sac6 Δ cells , stochastic vari - ations in the process , for example , variations in the amount of other cross - linkers such as Scp1 ( Aghamohammadzadeh and Ay - scough , 2009 ) , may allow the invagination to proceed through scission despite the absence of Sac6 . In bbc1 Δ cells , more actin is assembled , which results in a wider actin network than in wild - type cells . The start of membrane bending in bbc1 Δ cells is delayed with re - spect to the initiation of actin assembly , sug - gesting that during the first stage , the actin network is not organized in an optimal way to produce force for invagination growth . However , as soon as membrane bending is initiated , the invaginations in bbc1 Δ cells grow at the same rate as in wild - type cells . During the third stage in bbc1 Δ cells , the centroid movement of both actin cytoskele - tal proteins and coat proteins is enhanced . This suggests that either a final expansion or a rearrangement of the actin network is strongly enhanced , probably because more actin is present , thereby accelerating the coat movement . The force that is needed to pull a mem - brane tube depends on membrane shape and degree of protein coating ( Derenyi et al . , 2002 ; Powers et al . , 2002 ; Koster et al . , 2005 ; Dmitrieff and Nedelec , 2015 ) . For endocytosis , it has been suggested that the force required for the initiation of mem - brane bending is greater than the force needed to subsequently shape the mem - brane into a tubular invagination ( Dmitrieff and Nedelec , 2015 ) . On the basis of our ob - servations , we speculate that the formation of the actin network might have evolved to allow force generation to adjust to the changing force requirements during the different stages of endocytosis . The cross - linking of actin filaments controls the mechanical properties of the actin network : a network of cross - linked actin filaments sustains larger stresses with - out deformation and has a higher elastic modulus than actin fila - ments alone ( Sato et al . , 1987 ; Wachsstock et al . , 1994 ; Gardel et al . , 2004 ; Berro and Pollard , 2014 ; Bieling , Li , et al . , 2016 ) . Opti - mal cross - linking of the actin filaments may thus be critical to initiate membrane bending when the force required is the highest . Once membrane bending is initiated , the force required for pulling an in - vagination likely decreases , and filament nucleation and actin po - lymerization are therefore sufficient to drive invagination growth in the absence of the cross - linker Sac6 . However , when the nucleation of new filaments decreases during the last stage , the mechanical properties of the actin network become again important to provide the force necessary to proceed to the scission of the vesicle : a cross - linked actin network might be able to store and then release the Volume 29 June 1 , 2018 Actin in yeast endocytosis | 1355 stress accumulated during the first part of the invagination growth , and thus expand and pull the invagination until scission occurs . The release of stress could occur either due to the elasticity of the whole actin network or as a consequence of cross - linker turnover , which could release filament contacts that were induced under higher loads . The enlarged actin network in bbc1 Δ may accumulate more force than in wild - type cells , which could explain the speed - up dur - ing the final stage of endocytosis . MATERIALS AND METHODS Strain generation Yeast strains were generated by homologous recombination of the target genes with PCR cassettes encoding for fluorescent tags ( Janke et al . , 2004 ) .

Yeast cells were grown overnight at 25°C in SC - Trp . They were diluted in the morning and grown to log phase at 25°C . Cells were adhered to 25 mm coverslips ( Menzel - Gläser # 1 ) , which were coated with Concanavalin A ( 100 μg / ml ) . Adhered cells were imaged in SC - Trp medium with an Olympus IX81 microscope and an Olympus 100 × / 1 . 45 NA TIRF objective . Cells were excited for 80 – 250 ms per exposure with a 488 - nm laser or simultaneously with 488 - and 561 - nm lasers . For GFP - only images the emission light was filtered using a GFP - 3035C - OMF single - band filter set ( Semrock ) . For GFP and mCherry two - color simultaneous imaging , the excitation light was reflected with an OBS - U - M2TIR 488 / 561 ( Semrock ) dichroic mirror and the emission light was split and filtered with a DUAL - view beam splitter ( Optical Insights ) . Image analysis and trajectory alignment Images were background - subtracted and corrected for photo - bleaching . Before the endocytic events were tracked , the cytoplas - mic fluorescent signal was removed as described ( Picco et al . , 2015 ; Picco and Kaksonen , 2017 ) . Briefly , a median filter of radius 6 pixels was used to estimate the cytoplasmic fluorescent signal , which was then subtracted from the image itself . The endocytic events were tracked using the Particle Tracker plugin in Fiji / ImageJ ( Sbalzarini and Koumoutsakos , 2005 ) . Two - color trajectory posi - tions were corrected for chromatic aberrations by applying a warp - ing transformation that was computed from TetraSpeck bead images acquired under the same imaging conditions ( Picco et al . , 2015 ) . After that , the trajectories of each protein , with the excep - tion of Las17 - GFP , were aligned in space and in time and averaged using the trajalign module distribution available at http : / / apicco . github . io / trajectory _ alignment / ( Picco and Kaksonen , 2017 ) . Sla1 - GFP average trajectories in Figure 2 , B and C , were then aligned in time manually to compare their invagination dynamics . To align the average trajectories of each protein with those of the other pro - teins in the same yeast strain , we imaged simultaneously each pro - tein of interest , tagged with EGFP , and Abp1 , tagged with mCherry , in both wild - type and bbc1 Δ strains . We then tracked the dynamics and the appearance of the proteins of interest with respect to Abp1 and we used these trajectories to register the position and appearance of each average trajectory with respect to Abp1 ( Picco et al . , 2015 ; Picco and Kaksonen , 2017 ) . As Las17 - GFP does not move ( Picco et al . , 2015 ) , Las17 trajectories were tracked simulta - neously with Abp1 - mCherry trajectories . They were then aligned and averaged using the software in Picco et al . ( 2015 ) , which used the spatial and temporal alignment that aligned the Abp1 - mCherry trajectories together to compute the transformations that aligned Las17 - GFP trajectories . The average trajectories in the different strains were then plotted together in Figures 4 and 6 using the 1356 | A . Picco , W . Kukulski , et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell peak of the Rvs167 number of molecules in both the wild - type and bbc1 Δ to mark time 0 . In Figure 4 , the positions along the Y - axis are the positions of the average trajectories with respect to Abp1 shifted so that the average centroid positions of Sla1 trajectories before the invagination dynamics start are centered on 0 . Quantification of the number of proteins The average protein amounts were estimated by comparing the fluorescence intensities of the endocytic spots of the proteins of in - terest with the fluorescence intensity of Nuf2 - GFP spots in cells im - aged during their anaphase – telophase ( Joglekar et al . , 2006 ; Picco et al . , 2015 ) . The average amount of Arc18 - myGFP was estimated by comparison to Nuf2 - GFP spot intensities and by applying a cor - rection constant of 0 . 68 ± 0 . 14 ( Picco et al . , 2015 ) . The average pro - tein amounts were then used to calibrate the fluorescence intensity curves by scaling the average fluorescence intensity value ( Picco et al . , 2015 ) . Correlative light and electron microscopy Correlative light and electron microscopy was carried out as de - scribed before ( Kukulski et al . , 2011 , 2012b ) . Yeast cultures were grown at 25°C in SC - Trp medium to exponential phase . Cells were pelleted using vacuum filtration and high - pressure frozen using a Bal - tec HPM010 ( McDonald , 2007 ) . Freeze substitution , Lowicryl HM20 embedding , and sectioning were done according to the pro - tocol in Kukulski et al . ( 2012a ) . As fiducial markers for the correla - tion procedure , we used either blue 20 nm FluoSpheres ( Molecular Probes ; Kukulski et al . , 2012a ) or 50 nm TetraSpeck beads ( Life Technologies ; Suresh et al . , 2015 ) . Fluorescence microscopy of the resin sections on electron microscopy grids was performed imme - diately after sectioning , as detailed in Kukulski et al . ( 2012b ) and Suresh et al . ( 2015 ) . Low - magnification ( pixel size 2 . 53 nm ) and high - magni fication ( pixel size 1 . 18 nm ) electron - tomographic tilt series were acquired on a FEI Tecnai F30 microscope , set up as described ( Kukulski et al . , 2012a ) using Serial EM ( Mastronarde , 2005 ) , and reconstructed with IMOD ( Kremer et al . , 1996 ) . Cen - troids of GFP and mCherry signals were correlated with virtual slices of the low - magnification electron tomograms based on the fluorescent fiducial markers and in a second step with virtual slices of the high - magnification tomograms based on gold fiducial mark - ers using MATLAB - based correlation procedures described in Kukulski et al . ( 2011 ) . Quantification of membrane shape parameters and ribosome exclusion zones To quantify shapes of invaginations and vesicles as well as of ribo - some exclusion zones , we used precisely the same procedures as for the wild - type data set ( Kukulski et al . , 2012a ) . This allowed us to compare the parameters measured in the mutant cells directly with the wild - type data . In short , the Amira EM package ( Pruggnaller et al . , 2008 ) was used to click points along the cytoplasmic leaflet of plasma membrane invaginations in a selected virtual slice of the electron tomogram that was positioned to contain the long axis of the invagination . The groups of points were transferred into a coor - dinate system such that the x - axis corresponded to the plasma membrane . A local second - degree polynomial was fitted through the points using MATLAB . This fit was used to measure the invagina - tion length and radius of the invagination tip , as well as the appear - ance and position of a neck . The Amira EM package was also used to click points along the cytoplasmic leaflet of the vesicle mem - brane . This was done in the set of virtual slices that composed the whole vesicle , allowing us to fit an ellipsoid through the set of points . From the major axes of the ellipsoid , we calculated the vesi - cle surface area . In tomograms that contained vesicles , we also clicked points on the plasma membrane throughout the tomo - graphic volume . We then fitted a sphere through these points and determined the shortest distance from the vesicle center to the plasma membrane . To quantify the sizes of ribosome exclusion zones , we first generated an average of 11 consecutive virtual slices of which the central slice contained the invagination or the vesicle center . We overlaid this average with a hexagonal mesh of 50 nm spacing and determined which hexagons did not contain ribo - somes , as well as which hexagons contained the plasma membrane . These data provided us with estimates for the diameter of the exclu - sion zone ( parallel to the plasma membrane ) as well as the height of the exclusion zone . To calculate the volume of the exclusion zones of invaginations , we assumed the shape of a half - ellipsoid with two equal short axes . Statistics For statistical analysis of the membrane shapes and exclusion zones , we used GraphPad Prism or R ( https : / / cran . r - project . org / ) . All mu - tant data were compared with wild - type data ( Kukulski et al . , 2012a ) . For the data that are normally distributed , we used an unpaired two - tailed Welch’s test . To compare the exclusion zone volumes , the vesicle surfaces and their distance from the plasma membrane , we used a Mann – Whitney unpaired nonparametric test . All measurements from CLEM data shown in the figures are listed in Supplemental File 4 . Numbers ( n ) referring to CLEM data set sizes are technical replicates . Endocytic sites with multiple invaginations or vesicles As described for wild - type cells , in the correlative microscopy data set of mutant strains described here , we found endocytic sites that contained multiple endocytic events within the same exclusion zone ( Kukulski et al . , 2012a ) . In the sac6 Δ data set , one Sla1 - GFP Abp1 - mCherry spot contained two invaginations . These were included in all analysis . In the bbc1 Δ data set , of the 26 Rvs167 - GFP / Abp1 - mCherry spots , 6 contained multiple endocytic events . One site contained an invagination and a vesicle , one contained two invaginations , two contained two vesicles and two contained three vesicles each . Of 25 Sla1 - GFP / Abp1 - mCherry spots containing either invagina - tions or vesicles , four contained multiple events . One contained a vesicle and an invagination , two contained two invaginations , and one contained two vesicles . Of the 14 Abp1 - mCherry spots in the absence of Sla1 - GFP , two contained multiple events . One con - tained an invagination and a vesicle , and one contained three vesicles . We included these events in all analysis of membrane shape parameters . However , we did not use ribosome exclusion zones that contained multiple events for any quantification of ex - clusion zone sizes .
