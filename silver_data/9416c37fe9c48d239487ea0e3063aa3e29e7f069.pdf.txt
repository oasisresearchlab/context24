Introduction Multivesicular bodies ( MVBs ) are mid - stage endosomes that contain intraluminal vesicles ( ILVs ) . ILVs are generated by invagination and scission from the limiting membrane of the endosome . Ultimately , most ILVs are delivered to lysosomes , enabling degradation of transmembrane proteins and lipids ( Katzmann et al . , 2002 ; Gruenberg and Stenmark , 2004 ; for reviews see Babst , 2005 ; Hurley and Emr , 2006 ) . However , in certain specialized cells , MVBs also fuse with the plasma mem - brane to secrete their ILVs as entities called exosomes , which subserve a variety of important functions in the immune sys - tem and elsewhere ( Stoorvogel et al . , 2002 ; Thery et al . , 2002 ; Fevrier and Raposo , 2004 ) . A great deal of attention has recently focused on understanding how proteins are sorted into MVBs and how ILVs actually form . Among the proteins involved in creating ILVs are at least 18 that were identifi ed via genetic studies of vacuolar protein sorting in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae . Interfering with the function of any these proteins leads to missorting of cargo normally destined for the ILV , causing it to accumulate on the limiting membranes of abnormal compartments that form adjacent to the yeast vacuole ( its lysosome equivalent ) , the so - called class E compartments ( Raymond et al . , 1992 ) . Homologues of these class E proteins are present in mammalian cells and their role in the formation of MVBs appears to be well conserved ( for reviews see Hurley and Emr , 2006 ; Williams and Urbe , 2007 ) . Most of the class E proteins have also been implicated in the topologically similar process of viral budding ( Demirov and Freed , 2004 ; Morita and Sundquist , 2004 ) . All but one of the class E proteins are intrinsically soluble , cycling on and off the membrane as peripheral membrane pro - teins . Most are components of three large complexes , termed endosomal sorting complexes required for transport ( ESCRTs ) , including ESCRT - I , - II , and - III ( for reviews see Babst , 2005 ; Hurley and Emr , 2006 ; Slagsvold et al . , 2006 ; Williams and Urbe , 2007 ) . These complexes are thought to cooperate with each other ( and with additional factors ) to promote cargo selection and ILV formation . Signals that bring ESCRT complexes to the mem - brane include ubiquitin and phosphatidylinositol - 3 - phosphate , with current models suggesting that ESCRT complexes are recruited sequentially to ubiquitinated cargo on the endosomal membrane ( for review see Hurley and Emr , 2006 ) . It is not yet clear how ESCRT complexes orchestrate ILV formation but it is thought that they mostly dissociate from the invaginating mem - brane before the ILV is released because none end up at a high concentration within the lumen of the vesicle or viral particle E ndosomal sorting complex required for transport III ( ESCRT - III ) proteins function in multivesicular body biogenesis and viral budding . They are recruited from the cytoplasm to the membrane , where they assem - ble into large complexes . We used “ deep - etch ” electron microscopy to examine polymers formed by the ESCRT - III proteins hSnf7 - 1 ( CHMP4A ) and hSnf7 - 2 ( CHMP4B ) . When overexpressed , these proteins target to endosomes and the plasma membrane . Both hSnf7 proteins assemble into regular approximately 5 - nm ﬁ laments that curve and self - associate to create circular arrays . Binding to a co - expressed adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis – deﬁ cient mutant of VPS4B draws these ﬁ laments together into tight circular scaffolds that bend the membrane away from the cytoplasm to form buds and tubules protruding from the cell surface . Similar buds develop in the absence of mutant VPS4B when hSnf7 - 1 is expressed without its regulatory C - terminal domain . We demonstrate that hSnf7 proteins form novel membrane - attached ﬁ laments that can promote or stabilize negative curvature and outward budding . We suggest that ESCRT - III polymers delineate and help generate the luminal vesicles of multi - vesicular bodies .

Such deletions are thought to mimic the action of cellular ESCRT - III binding partners . One example of a binding partner that recruits and activates an ESCRT - III protein is the ESCRT - II subunit Vps25 ( EAP25 in mammalian cells ) , which binds to the N - terminal half of Vps20 ( Teo et al . , 2004 ; Yorikawa et al . , 2005 ; Langelier et al . , 2006 ) . Other examples of interacting proteins opening ESCRT - III proteins seem likely to emerge . Once assembled into complexes on the membrane , it is not yet clear how ESCRT - III proteins contribute to luminal vesicle formation or viral budding . Genetic studies in the yeast S . cere - visiae suggest that they act late in the process , after ESCRT - I and ESCRT - II . Missing from current models is an understanding of which factors drive the required membrane deformation and eventual separation of ILVs from the limiting membrane of the endosome ( for reviews see Hurley and Emr , 2006 ; Williams and Urbe , 2007 ) . In the present study , we fi nd that the ESCRT - III proteins hSnf7 - 1 / CHMP4A and hSnf7 - 2 / CHMP4B assemble into circular membrane - associated polymers that can be engaged to deform the membrane to which they are attached . We pro - pose that membrane - associated ESCRT - III polymers similar to these may contribute to delineating and generating vesicles within the lumen of the MVB . Results hSnf7 assembles into homopolymeric ﬁ laments on the membrane To study the organization of ESCRT - III – containing polymers by quick - freeze deep - etch EM ( DEEM ) , we took advantage of our previous observation that overexpressed hSnf7 ( CHMP4 ) proteins accumulate in patches on or adjacent to the plasma membrane as well as on internal , mostly endosomal , compart - ments ( Lin et al . , 2005 ; Shim et al . , 2007 ) . The plasma mem - brane is more accessible to DEEM than internal organelles because cells need only be “ unroofed ” to obtain expansive images of it and structures attached to it ( Heuser , 2000a , b ) . The anaglyph in the top of Fig . 1 shows a typical image of the inner surface of the plasma membrane of a COS - 7 cell , which in this case is transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding full - length FLAG - tagged hSnf7 - 1 ( CHMP4A ) . Visible on the membrane are the usual cortical cytoskeletal components , in - cluding actin fi laments and polygonal clathrin lattices , but , in addition , there are abundant fi laments that are curved and inter - connected to form a variety of circular arrays . In some areas , these new fi laments intermingle with actin and clathrin , whereas in other areas they are so abundant that they displace these nor - mal residents of the plasma membrane . It is important to note that transiently transfected COS - 7 cells produce ESCRT - III proteins at levels that greatly exceed the concentration of their endogenous counterparts ( unpublished data ) , creating a situa - tion in which we can study the behavior of transfected proteins without signifi cant contributions from endogenous proteins or binding partners . Higher magnifi cation DEEM views of cells expressing hSnf7 - 1 or the related hSnf7 - 2 ( CHMP4B ) show that the novel fi laments have a unit diameter of (cid:2) 5 - 6 nm ( including the (cid:2) 2 - nm ( for review see Olver and Vidal , 2007 ) . The release of ESCRT complexes from the membrane is probably driven by the AAA + ( ATPases associated with a variety of cellular activities ) protein VPS4 , of which there are two isoforms in mammalian cells , VPS4A and VPS4B / SKD1 ( Babst et al . , 1998 ) . ESCRT - I and - II are stable heterooligomeric complexes ( Katzmann et al . , 2001 ; Babst et al . , 2002b ) . Each has recently been crystallized both in pieces and as a complex ( Hierro et al . , 2004 ; Teo et al . , 2004 , 2006 ; Kostelansky et al . , 2006 , 2007 ) and a reasonable understanding of how these complexes inter - face with ubiquitin , the membrane , and other components of the MVB sorting machinery is emerging ( for reviews see Hurley and Emr , 2006 ; Williams and Urbe , 2007 ) . Less is known about the organization and interactions of proteins within the ESCRT - III complex . This complex consists of several related proteins that are recruited from the cytosol to the endosomal membrane , where they assemble into large detergent insoluble polymers ( Babst et al . , 2002a ) . Yeast has six ESCRT - III proteins , each a 200 – 250 - residue protein with basic N - terminal and acidic C - terminal halves . Four of these proteins are thought to form the core ESCRT - III complex ( Snf7p , Vps20p , Vps2p , and Vps24p ) , whereas two others ( Did2p and Vps60p ) associate with the core complex and may play regulatory roles ( Babst et al . , 2002a ; Nickerson et al . , 2006 ) . The ESCRT - III family is expanded to 11 proteins in humans , which are referred to either as human orthologues of their yeast counterparts or as charged MVB proteins ( CHMPs ) . Although each of the six ESCRT - III proteins in yeast is needed for normal MVB biogenesis , there may be some functional redundancy among the 11 human proteins . Understanding how ESCRT - III components work together and why so many related proteins are needed for MVB biogenesis clearly requires additional insight into the organization and func - tion of the complex or complexes that they form . A recent crystal structure of part of the ESCRT - III pro tein hVps24 ( CHMP3 ) showed that it consists of an (cid:2) 7 - nm - long (cid:2) - helical hairpin buttressed by three shorter helices ( Muziol et al . , 2006 ) . Based on homology , it seems likely that other ESCRT - III proteins share a similar structural core . Clues about how ESCRT - III proteins assemble into large complexes come from the several types of contacts between hVps24 protomers in the crystal , any or all of which could be involved in ESCRT - III polymerization . Recent studies support the idea that individual ESCRT - III proteins have an intrinsic ability to bind to membranes that is regulated by autoinhibitory sequences located near their C termini ( Muziol et al . , 2006 ; Zamborlini et al . , 2006 ; Shim et al . , 2007 ) . In one case ( the crystallized fragment of hVps24 ) , basic residues spread along a gently curved surface have been shown to be necessary for membrane binding ( Muziol et al . , 2006 ) and similar charge - based interactions may be at least partially responsible for association of the other ESCRT - III proteins with membranes . Binding to the membrane is thought to coincide with assembly of the ESCRT - III complex , leading to a model in which “ closed ” ESCRT - III proteins are soluble , whereas “ open ” ESCRT - III pro - teins on the membrane are available for interaction with other ESCRT components . Experimentally , membrane binding and complex assembly can be elicited by deleting C - terminal auto - on N o v e m be r 8 , 2011 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published January 21 , 2008 391 PROPERTIES OF H S NF 7 POLYMERS • HANSON ET AL . overexpressed hSnf7 - 1 remains insoluble after treatment with non denaturing detergents ( Lin et al . , 2005 ; Shim et al . , 2007 ) . The connections between adjacent fi laments may contribute to stabilizing the circular patterns formed by the fi laments . Particles corresponding at least in part to transmembrane pro - teins appear to be confi ned both at the center of the hSnf7 arrays and between the fi laments , which suggests that one function of hSnf7 polymers may be to control the distribution of pro - teins in the membrane in a manner similar to that previously proposed for actin fi laments close to the plasma membrane ( Morone et al . , 2006 ) . Several observations indicate that these novel fi laments are predominantly homopolymers of hSnf7 . Most striking is their altered appearance when GFP is fused to the C terminus of hSnf7 - 1 ( Fig . 2 ) . Filaments built from hSnf7 - 1 – GFP are wider and thickness of the platinum replica that coats them ) and appear to be tightly associated with the plasma membrane ( Fig . 1 B ) . Transverse striations can be seen faintly in many regions along the fi laments . When most distinct , these striations repeat every (cid:2) 4 nm ( Fig . 1 C , a ) . The fi laments frequently associate with each other laterally , either forming focal contact points between single fi laments ( Fig . 1 C , b ; and Fig . 1 D , b ) or generating wider strands that contain two or more intertwined fi laments . Larger bun - dles containing four or more strands tend to be less tightly asso - ciated with the membrane but are split into single - diameter fi laments at the membrane ( Fig . 1 C , c and d ; and Fig . 1 D , c ) . Sometimes fi laments branch without apparently changing their diameter , which suggests that there are numerous ways in which hSnf7 protomers interact with each other . The length of the hSnf7 fi laments offers a straightforward explanation for why Figure 1 . hSnf7 proteins form curved ﬁ la - ments on the plasma membrane .

In nontransfected cells , this procedure provides views of a subplasmalemmal cytoskeleton that has been converted by chemical fi xation into a microtrabecular meshwork ( Fig . 3 , middle , see cell on the right ; Heuser , 2002 ) . Cells expressing hSnf7 - 1 additionally contain characteristic domains of interconnected , roughly circular arrays of fi laments ( Fig . 3 , middle and bottom ) . These fi laments can be immunodecorated with a gold - conjugated antibody against a FLAG epitope tag on hSnf7 - 1 , confi rming that they contain hSnf7 - 1 ( not depicted ) . Both on unroofed plasma membranes and along the top surface of hSnf7 - expressing cells , there is considerable variation in the curvature of individual fi laments and the spacing be - tween adjacent fi laments that create a range of hSnf7 - based arrays . A consequence of this variation that is most apparent when viewing the tops of cells is that in the closely spaced arrays , central rings tend to rise above those at the periphery ( Fig . 3 , bottom left ) . This phenomenon is particularly strik - ing with polymers formed from GFP - tagged hSnf7 - 1 ( Fig . 3 , bottom right ) . An important functional difference between hSnf7 - 1 with and without GFP fused to its C terminus is that overexpressed hSnf7 - 1 – GFP strongly inhibits MVB maturation and viral budding , whereas hSnf7 - 1 lacking GFP does not ( von Schwedler et al . , 2003 ) . This could be caused by the attached GFP per - turbing the protein ’ s normal closed conformation , effectively locking hSnf7 into an open state . Alternatively , the GFP might interfere with recruitment of specifi c C - terminal binding part - ners . Either way , we wondered whether there might be a corre - lation between the arrangement of hSnf7 fi laments , membrane eversion , and the normal functioning of ESCRT - III proteins in the MVB pathway . We therefore decided to study the effects of manipulating hSnf7 ’ s C terminus by either adding binding part - ners or deleting domains . bumpier than those formed by hSnf7 - 1 alone , as would be expected from doubling the mass of each subunit ( both hSnf7 - 1 and GFP are (cid:2) 25 kD in mass ) . Additional support for the idea that the fi laments are primarily polymers of hSnf7 includes the fact that the fi laments are present only in a subset of cells after transient transfection with hSnf7 and the fact that the fi laments can be decorated specifi cally with gold - labeled antibody recognizing an epitope tag on hSnf7 ( see Fig . 4 , top ; and not depicted ) . A difference between the fi laments formed by hSnf7 - 1 with no tag or a small epitope tag and those formed by hSnf7 - 1 – GFP is that the latter are frequently tightly associated with each other , often to the point of creating compact circular arrays that appear as confl uent domains of protein . Such tight structures are not seen in cells overexpressing hSnf7 - 1 without GFP ( compare Figs . 1 and 2 ) . Their formation is not caused by the dimerization of GFP because mutating GFP to reduce its affi nity for itself ( Snapp et al . , 2003 ) does not change their appearance ( not depicted ) . Fusing GFP to the C terminus of hSnf7 - 1 must therefore expose something within hSnf7 - 1 that enhances lateral interactions between fi laments . Two limitations to imaging unroofed cells are , fi rst , that we can only examine the bottom or ventral surface of the cell where changes in the shape of the membrane are constrained and , second , that we have to lyse the cells during sample prepara - tion . To look instead at the dorsal or top surfaces of nondisrupted cells , we switched to freeze - drying and platinum - replicating whole cells . As expected , cells overexpressing hSnf7 - 1 dis - play areas with subtle circular patterns on their top surfaces that are comparable in size and organization to the curved fi la - ment arrays seen on the plasma membrane of unroofed cells ( Fig . 3 , top ) . To study the top surface of the cell in more detail , we ap - plied a method for imaging the cell cortex in which cells are chemically fi xed and then treated with a mixture of Triton X - 100 Figure 2 . Filaments containing hSnf7 - 1 – GFP show their GFP .

VPS4 is thought to hydrolyze ATP and disassemble ESCRT - III complexes , most likely by unfolding and removing individ - ual protein subunits from the polymeric ESCRT - III complex . Recent studies reveal that VPS4 binds directly to a microtubule interacting and traffi cking – interacting motif present near the C termini of CHMP1 , CHMP2 , and CHMP3 ( Obita et al . , 2007 ; Stuchell - Brereton et al . , 2007 ) . Other sequences are likely to be responsible for VPS4 binding to hSnf7 ( CHMP4 ) proteins . To gain insight into how VPS4 might affect the hSnf7 polymers examined here , we coexpressed a “ substrate trap ” A hydrolysis - defective mutant of VPS4B binds to hSnf7 polymers and promotes membrane eversion Among proteins that interact with ESCRT - III family members , the most general appears to be the AAA + ATPase VPS4 ( of which there are two isoforms in mammalian cells , VSP4A and VPS4B / SKD1 ) . This ATPase binds to most if not all of the indi - vidual ESCRT - III proteins , albeit with varying affi nity ( von Schwedler et al . , 2003 ; Scott et al . , 2005b ; Lottridge et al . , 2006 ; Tsang et al . , 2006 ; Zamborlini et al . , 2006 ; Shim et al . , 2007 ) .

Although the density of VPS4B particles varied widely , there were many arrays on which the particles were essentially con - fl uent . These VPS4B oligomers not only obscured the under - lying hSnf7 - 1 fi laments but also tightened the arrays to create compact circular structures on the membrane . Importantly , the change in the hSnf7 fi lament arrays caused by binding to VPS4 ( E235Q ) was accompanied by the appearance of distortions in the membrane at the center of the arrays . This could be glimpsed in views of unroofed plasma membranes , where dense hSnf7 arrays had small central gaps or holes that appeared slightly everted ( presumably limited by mutant of VPS4B , VPS4B ( E235Q ) , with hSnf7 - 1 in COS - 7 cells . This mutant form of VPS4B is unable to hydrolyze ATP be - cause of a change in its Walker B motif and therefore binds tightly to its protein substrates ( Hanson and Whiteheart , 2005 ) . We found that VPS4B ( E235Q ) with or without a GFP tag ac - cumulated on hSnf7 fi laments , where it appeared as a large particle along the cytoplasmic surface of the fi laments ( Fig . 4 ) . These particles were recognized by antibodies against epitope tags or GFP attached to VPS4 , which confi rms that , as expected , they are VPS4B ( E235Q ) ( Fig . 4 , top ) . Their sizes range from (cid:2) 10 to (cid:2) 16 nm , which is signifi cantly larger than expected for a VPS4B - GFP monomer and could instead be consistent with Figure 4 . hSnf7 / CHMP4 ﬁ laments bind VPS4B ( E235Q ) .

VPS4B ( E235Q ) particles on the detergent - extracted scaffolds because these are external views of the fi laments and would not be expected to show proteins attached to the opposite cyto - plasmic surface . The subplasmalemmal scaffolds could also be seen to good advantage in replicas of unextracted cells when and where the membrane happened to peel back during the freeze - drying process ( Fig . 7 ) . This is a fortuitous occurrence that provides clean and undistorted views of submembranous protein lattices ( unpublished data ) . In the case of cells expressing hSnf7 and VPS4B ( E235Q ) , these views confi rm that hSnf7 fi laments ex - tend beyond the perimeter of the buds and tubules to create a circular base . Examination of the spacing between adjacent fi la - ments shows that the fi laments are tightly and regularly packed within and directly around the everting tubules and may become less interconnected as the lattice extends further away from the tubule . Not all of the lattices have central eversions , per - haps because those that recruit less VPS4B do not undergo the required structural change . the fact that the ventral surface of the cell cannot extend far before reaching the glass on which the cells are growing ; Fig . 4 ) . Much more obvious changes could be seen on the tops of freeze - dried whole cells . There , it was apparent that co - expressing hSnf7 and VPS4B ( E235Q ) led to the formation of buds and occasionally tubules that extended out from the cell ( Fig . 5 ) . These measured (cid:2) 100 – 120 nm in diameter and ex - tended to varying heights . They could easily be distinguished from microvilli by their comparatively large size because micro - villi are only (cid:2) 50 nm in diameter . Similar tubules developed on cells coexpressing hSnf7 - 2 and VPS4B ( E235Q ) - GFP as well as hSnf7 - 1 and VPS4B ( E235Q ) - myc ( unpublished data ) . We examined the protein scaffold lining these tubules by again extracting fi xed cells with detergents , which revealed closely spaced and highly regular subplasmalemmal fi laments with a unit diameter similar to the fi laments seen on top of cells expressing only hSnf7 ( Fig . 6 ) . These fi laments could be immuno - decorated with antibodies against epitope tags on either hSnf7 or VPS4B ( unpublished data ) . Note that there are no visible Figure 5 .

(cid:2) 100 – 120 nm ) and only rarely elongate into tubules . Again , concentrated at the centers or apices of these buds are particles that probably correspond to trapped transmem - brane proteins . Not surprisingly , plasma membrane buds were easier to fi nd in cells that expressed a mutant form of hSnf7 ( 1 – 116 ) in which a cysteine replaces serine at residue two because this mutant undergoes palmitoylation and is more effi ciently targeted to the plasma membrane than normal ( Lin et al . , 2005 ) . Further examination of cells expressing hSnf7 ( 1 – 116 ) ( with either cysteine or the wild - type serine at residue two ) revealed that fi ne fi laments are visible on the plasma membrane . These can be Polymers formed by an hSnf7 - 1 fragment suggest a role for the N - terminal region in bud formation To further explore the relationship between hSnf7 and membrane eversion , we studied the effects of removing the C - terminal half of the hSnf7 - 1 protein . We used an N - terminal hSnf7 - 1 fragment ( residues 1 – 116 ) that we previously showed associated well with the plasma membrane ( Lin et al . , 2005 ) . This fragment retains the core (cid:2) - helical hairpin predicted by the CHMP3 / hVps24 crys - tal structure ( Muziol et al . , 2006 ) but is constitutively open and does not interact with VPS4B ( Lin et al . , 2005 ) . Strikingly , whole cells expressing hSnf7 ( 1 – 116 ) have regions on their dorsal sur - faces that are abundantly studded with distinctive buds ( Fig . 8 ) . Figure 6 .

On these membranes , immunoreactive VPS4B ( E235Q ) - GFP again appears as particles 10 – 16 nm in diameter ( Fig . 9 ) . These particles typi - cally appear in chains , as if they are decorating an underlying threadlike polymer on the membrane ( likely one composed of endogenous ESCRTs , although we cannot rule out other pos - sibilities ) . The chains of VPS4B ( E235Q ) particles often curve to form circles (cid:2) 100 nm or more in diameter , reminiscent of indi - vidual rings created by overexpressed full - length hSnf7 . Some - times , the circles of mutant VPS4B particles surround circular or helical arrays of fi laments that distort the plasma membrane , pushing it outwards . One possibility is that these represent endogenous ESCRT - III fi laments “ corralled ” by mutant VPS4 . Alternatively , these could be coat components of an unidentifi ed virus that is intrinsic to our cultured cells and whose budding has been blocked by expression of the mutant VPS4 . Discussion MVB biogenesis is governed at least in part by transient recruit - ment of ESCRT complexes and associated proteins to the limiting membrane of the endosome . Among the proteins involved in seen on the inner surface of the membrane in unroofed cells ( Fig . 8 , top right ) as well as in freeze - fracture images of cells grown on sapphire ( Fig . 8 , middle right ) and on top of fi xed whole cells that have been extracted with detergent ( Fig . 8 , bottom right ) . In many cases , the fi laments associate laterally with each other and curve into circular arrays . The fact that the pattern of these fi lament arrays is particularly evident in freeze - fracture images demonstrates that the protein directly or indirectly affects the structure of the membrane bilayer . A peculiarity of the hSnf7 ( 1 – 116 ) fi laments visible in unroofed cells is that they are often decorated on their cytoplasmic surfaces with many copies of an unusually large particle ( > 20 nm in diameter ) . Whether these particles are normal binding partners for the ESCRT - III machin - ery ( i . e . , ESCRT - I and ESCRT - II complexes ) or are something unrelated has yet to be determined . VPS4B ( E235Q ) mutant accumulates in rings on membranes of cells even with no exogenous ESCRT - III expression To determine whether fi laments or scaffolds anything like those shown in the previous section form in cells expressing only endogenous levels of ESCRT - III components , we fi nally exam - ined stable tetracycline - inducible HEK293 cell lines in which the ESCRT pathway can be inhibited by regulated expression of VPS4B ( E235Q ) - GFP ( Lin et al . , 2005 ) .

Although we cannot defi ne the arrangement of protein subunits within these fi laments , some possibilities can be gleaned from the recent crystal structure of a fragment of another ESCRT - III protein , hVps24 ( CHMP3 ) ( Muziol et al . , 2006 ) . The core of this ESCRT - III protein is an (cid:2) 7 - nm - long (cid:2) - helical hairpin , which in the crystal binds to a partner subunit to form an antiparallel dimer . To fi t such dimers into the smallest fi laments seen here , the long axes of the helical formation of ILVs must be factors that select membrane and cargo for incorporation into the ILV and factors that promote the membrane deformation needed to drive ILV formation . Here , we found that the ESCRT - III proteins hSnf7 - 1 ( CHMP4A ) and hSnf7 - 2 ( CHMP4B ) assemble into fi lamentous polymers on membranes . The circles formed by these fi laments may con - tribute both to defi ning the contents of a nascent ILV and de - forming the membrane to create it . Insight into the function of ESCRT - III proteins has been slow in coming ( Russell et al . , 2006 ) and the novel properties of the subset of ESCRT - III proteins described here should form the basis for further exploration of their role in ILV formation .

Although we focused our study on plasma membrane polymers for technical reasons ( e . g . , ease of visibility ) , there is good evidence that ESCRT proteins can function on the plasma membrane as well as on the endosome . Most proteins involved in MVB biogenesis ( including hSnf7 and VPS4 ) have been implicated in the budding of several enveloped viruses , which at least in some cases happens on the plasma membrane ( von Schwedler et al . , 2003 ; Fisher et al . , 2007 ; Fraile - Ramos et al . , 2007 ) . Moreover , several recent studies have shown that there are endosome - like domains in the plasma membrane , which in turn has led to the proposal that exosome - like vesicles might bud directly from the plasmalemma ( Booth et al . , 2006 ; Nydegger et al . , 2006 ) . Finally , the ESCRT machinery has recently been shown to be necessary for completing cytokine - sis , again requiring function at the plasma membrane ( Carlton and Martin - Serrano , 2007 ; Morita et al . , 2007 ) . Thus , at least in certain situations , the ESCRT machinery , probably includ - ing the ESCRT - III complex , is recruited to and operational at the plasma membrane . ESCRT - III scaffolds and membrane deformation Current thinking is that one way in which proteins deform membranes is by attaching tightly to them and imposing their intrinsic geometry upon them . Well - studied examples of this include the curved polymers formed by coat proteins ( i . e . , the binding of clathrin lattices to the plasmalemma during coated pit formation ; Heuser , 1989a ; Hinrichsen et al . , 2006 ) and viral structural proteins ( i . e . , the binding of viral matrix proteins to the plasmalemma to form viral particles ; Karacostas et al . , 1989 ; Morita and Sundquist , 2004 ) as well as the more localized deformations associated with curved helical proteins containing Bin / amphiphysin / Rvs ( BAR ) domains and related structural motifs ( Peter et al . , 2004 ; McMahon and Gallop , 2005 ; Itoh and De Camilli , 2006 ; Shimada et al . , 2007 ) . In the case of the ESCRT pathway and ILV formation , there has been to date little structural evidence for involvement of complexes with the ability to distort the membrane . Our im - ages suggest that ESCRT - III subunits assembled into fi laments and circular lattices may be able to drive and / or stabilize nega - tive membrane curvature such as is needed to generate vesicles that bud away from the cytoplasm . The mechanism for these ef - fects could be similar to that used by BAR domain – containing proteins ( Peter et al . , 2004 ; McMahon and Gallop , 2005 ) , with the shape of the ESCRT - III polymers promoting negative rather than positive curvature . The idea that proteins with an “ inverse ” BAR domain shape might promote negative curvature ( and mem - brane evolution ) has been proposed ( McMahon and Gallop , 2005 ) and , very recently , demonstrated in a study of two actin binding proteins involved in the formation of fi lopodia , missing in metastasis , and IRSp53 ( Mattila et al . , 2007 ) . These proteins contain a gently curved helical domain and create everting tubules lined on their interior with the proteins . It is not diffi cult to imagine that dimers of the (cid:2) - helical hairpin at the core of ESCRT - III subunits would use a positively charged , gently convex surface ( Muziol et al . , 2006 ) to create the kind of membrane distortions described in the present paper . hairpins would have to run roughly parallel to the fi lament . This could be accomplished by a simple tip - to - tip interaction between dimers as occurs in the crystal or by opening up the hairpins to allow other types of intersubunit interactions not seen in the crystal . The variety of interconnections that we see between adjacent hSnf7 fi laments indicates that there is more than one way for these subunits to interact with each other , and coassembly of hSnf7 with other ESCRT - III proteins is likely to yet further expand the ways in which the subunits associate with each other . Our fi nding that fi laments also form when the N - terminal half of hSnf7 - 1 ( which contains little besides the (cid:2) - helical hairpin ) is expressed ( Fig . 9 ) suggests that the N - terminal helical hairpin domain by itself is suffi cient to allow polymer assembly . Once assembled and attached to a membrane , hSnf7 fi la - ments have an intrinsic tendency to curve ( Figs . 1 – 3 ) . This ap - pears to derive from the shape of the subunits and / or the way in which they interact with each other . The degree of curvature is not fi xed because the path taken by individual fi laments varies widely ( e . g . , compare the curvature of a fi lament near the center of an array with that of one at its periphery ) . Interfi lament con - tacts may contribute to stabilizing or even creating the circular arrays . When the fi laments are tightly associated with each other and the membrane , their shape could play a role in de - forming the membrane , as will be further discussed in the fi nal section of the Discussion . Relevance of hSnf7 / CHMP4 polymers to a native ESCRT - III complex It is important to emphasize that the polymers studied in this paper arise from overexpressed proteins and do not necessarily correspond to normal intermediates in the ESCRT pathway . Both up - and downstream components of the ESCRT pathway have been bypassed or overwhelmed by hSnf7 overexpression , allowing unopposed growth of hSnf7 polymers that may ex - aggerate or even change their normal effects on membranes . There are , however , several reasons to believe that these over - grown polymers reveal important characteristics of ESCRT - III proteins that are relevant to understanding how these proteins contribute to MVB biogenesis . These include the facts that the fi laments ( a ) are highly organized , ( b ) bind specifi cally to rele - vant proteins such as VPS4B ( Figs . 4 – 7 ) , ( c ) bind tightly to both the plasmalemma and endosomes ( this paper ; Lin et al . , 2005 ; Shim et al . , 2007 ) , ( d ) do not form nonspecifi c aggregates with other cellular proteins , ( e ) share properties with complexes of endogenous ESCRT proteins trapped by inhibiting the path - way in yeast , including being detergent insoluble and extremely large , and ( f ) resemble structures trapped by expressing mu - tant VPS4B ( E235Q ) on its own ( Fig . 9 ) . The fact that individual hSnf7 proteins homooligomerize into regular structures leads us to suggest that ESCRT - III complex could be either a defi ned heteropolymer , as is currently assumed , or a series of intercon - nected homopolymers . Our preliminary studies of other ESCRT - III proteins support the idea that each can form homopolymers that when opened or activated recruit other ESCRT - III components ( Shim et al . , 2007 ) . Further exploration of the structure of com - plexes containing multiple ESCRT - III proteins and their effects on membranes will clearly be an important next step . on N o v e m be r 8 , 2011 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published January 21 , 2008 JCB • VOLUME 180 • NUMBER 2 • 2008 400 Cell growth COS - 7 cells were grown in DME ( Invitrogen ) containing 5 % fetal bovine serum ( Invitrogen ) , 5 % supplemented calf serum ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁ c ) , and 2 mM L - glutamine . TREx - HEK293 cells expressing VPS4B ( E235Q ) - GFP were grown in DME containing 10 % tetracycline - free fetal bovine serum ( Atlanta Biologics ) , 2 mM L - glutamine , 5 (cid:3) g / ml blasticidin , and 100 (cid:3) g / ml zeocin as described previously ( Lin et al . , 2005 ) . Expression of VPS4B ( E235Q ) in these cells was induced by adding 0 . 5 (cid:3) g / ml tetracycline for 4 – 6 h . Transfections and sample preparation for DEEM For DEEM , cells were grown on 3 × 3 - mm glass ( or where indicated , sap - phire ) coverslips . COS - 7 cells were transfected with plasmids using Lipo - fectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen ) according to the manufacturer ’ s instructions and were used 18 – 24 h after transfection . To prepare unroofed cells , cover - slips were brieﬂ y rinsed in serum - free , Hepes - buffered Ringer solution ( 30 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM NaCl , and 2 mM CaCl 2 ) and then unroofed using a brief pulse of ultrasound as described previously ( Heuser , 2000a ) in an intracellular buffer ( 30 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 2 , 70 mM KCl , 5 mM MgCl2 , and 3 mM EGTA ) . Samples were immediately ﬁ xed in the same buffer containing 2 % glutaraldehyde or 4 % paraformaldehyde . To prepare whole cells , cells on coverslips were simply ﬁ xed in Ringer solution contain - ing 2 % glutaraldehyde or 4 % paraformaldehyde . To extract ﬁ xed whole cells with detergent , ﬁ xed coverslips were incubated for at least 2 h in buf - fer containing 1 % Triton X - 100 ( Sigma - Aldrich ) and 0 . 1 % saponin . Immunogold antibody decoration For antibody decoration , samples ﬁ xed in formaldehyde were quenched in 50 mM NH 4 Cl , 50 mM lysine , and 50 mM glycine . Samples were then blocked in 30 mM Hepes , pH 7 . 4 , 100 mM NaCl , and 2 mM CaCl 2 con - taining 1 % bovine serum albumin , incubated in primary antibody for 1 h , washed , incubated with 18 - nm gold - conjugated goat anti – rabbit or anti – mouse , washed again , and postﬁ xed in buffer containing 2 % glutaralde - hyde . Primary antibodies used were rabbit anti - GFP and rabbit and mouse ( M2 ) anti - FLAG ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . Freezing , replicating , and imaging samples Coverslips with samples to be frozen were washed in water and then quick - frozen by abrupt application ( slamming ) of the coverslip onto a liquid helium – cooled copper block using a cryopress ( Heuser et al . , 1979 , 1989b ) . Coverslips were stored in liquid nitrogen until mounting in a freeze - etch device ( Oerlikon Balzers ) , where they were immediately warmed to (cid:4) 80 ° C , freeze - dried for 15 min in vacuo , and replicated with 2 nm of platinum , which was vacuum evaporated onto them from 24 ° above horizontal while they rotated at 20 rpm . For freeze - fracture of cells grown on sapphire , the coverslip was frozen upside down , stored in liquid nitrogen , mounted in the freeze - etch device , warmed to (cid:4) 105 ° C , fractured by popping the sap - phire off with the knife , etched by sitting for 2 min in vacuo , and then repli - cated as above . In all cases , replicas were separated from the coverslips by ﬂ otation on concentrated hydroﬂ uoric acid , and washed brieﬂ y with 4 % sodium hy - pochlorite ( bleach ) and several rinses of water before being retrieved on 400 - mesh Formvar - coated grids ( Electron Microscopy Sciences ) . These were then viewed with a standard transmission EM ( JEOL ) operating at 100 kV and imaged at two different degrees of tilt ( ± 10 ° ) with standard EM ﬁ lm . Thereafter , the stereo pairs of ﬁ lm were aligned by superimposition on a copy stand and rerecorded as 4 , 492 × 3 , 328 - pixel ( 17 - Mp ) digital images with a digital single - lens reﬂ ex camera ( EOS - 1Ds Mark II ; Canon ) . Finally , the digital image pairs were converted ( one to red and the other to green ) , layered on top of each other with the screen blending mode in Photoshop ( Adobe ) , aligned to each other , and , where necessary , adjusted to equalize their brightness and contrast to create the ﬁ nal 3D anaglyphs shown here ( Heuser , 2000b ) .

Submitted : 4 July 2007 Accepted : 17 December 2007 There are several questions that need to be answered be - fore we can propose a specifi c model for the role of ESCRT - III polymers in MVB biogenesis . The most important is when and where the polymers assemble and are subsequently removed . Defi ning when ESCRT components dissociate from each other and the membrane is particularly important because their con - tinued presence on the membrane of a vesicle after it is released from the limiting membrane would trap them inside the lumen of the vesicle . This is inconsistent with current data showing that ESCRT proteins are not present at a high concentration in either viral particles or ILVs and exosomes ( for review see Olver and Vidal , 2007 ) . One way out of this dilemma would be for ESCRT - III polymers to initiate membrane deformation but remain only at the perimeter or evolving neck of the vesicle , perhaps as a result of ongoing and closely coupled VPS4 - driven disassembly of the ESCRT complexes . Changes in the lipid composition of the evolving vesicle could play a role in vesicle evolution , as has been previously suggested for lysobisphospha - tidic acid , a cone - shaped lipid known to be present at high con - centrations in ILVs ( Matsuo et al . , 2004 ) . The Snf7 subfamily of ESCRT - III proteins may have a unique and particularly important role in the steps leading to creation of ILVs , particularly if they recruit other ESCRT - III proteins and their specifi c binding partners to join the poly - mers they form . Indeed , evidence for a special role for hSnf7 comes from studies of viral budding , where recent data shows that the late domain - interacting protein Alix only functions in viral release when its ability to recruit hSnf7 is intact ( Fisher et al . , 2007 ) . Current understanding of how membrane budding into the MVB is driven is clearly limited . Although ESCRT - III pro - teins have been implicated in this process , evidence for their involvement has been indirect and primarily based on the development of a class E compartment in yeast when ESCRT - III function is impaired . The images presented here of hSnf7 show that even without upstream regulatory factors , this pro - tein is capable of forming uniform circular structures that can be induced to drive formation of everting buds and tubules . These images are the fi rst to show that an ESCRT - III polymer is associated with changes in the curvature of a membrane . Important future steps will be to compare the structure of other ESCRT - III homo - and heteropolymers with those of hSnf7 to determine how these polymers interface with other compo - nents of the ESCRT machinery and fi nally to visualize the ac - tual events that occur on isolated , functional MVBs as they actively form and involute their ILVs .

Note that VPS4B is synonymous with SKD1 . pcDNA3 . 1 - FLAG - hSnf7 - 2 full length ( residues 1 – 222 ) was used as described previously ( Shiels et al . , 2007 ) . Finally , a QuikChange site - directed mutagenesis kit ( Stratagene ) was used to mutate leucine 221 of GFP to lysine in hSnf7 - 1 – GFP to create hSnf7 - 1 – mGFP ( Snapp et al . , 2003 ) . on N o v e m be r 8 , 2011 j c b . r up r e ss . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m Published January 21 , 2008 401 PROPERTIES OF H S NF 7 POLYMERS • HANSON ET AL . complex and its role in human immunodefi ciency virus type 1 release .
