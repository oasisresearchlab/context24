Heissler 2 † , Salma Pathan - Chhatbar 2 , Dietmar j . Manstein 2 , 3 & Stefan Raunser 1 The interaction of myosin with actin filaments is the central feature of muscle contraction 1 and cargo movement along actin filaments of the cytoskeleton 2 . The energy for these movements is generated during a complex mechanochemical reaction cycle 3 , 4 . Crystal structures of myosin in different states have provided important structural insights into the myosin motor cycle when myosin is detached from F - actin 5 – 7 . The difficulty of obtaining diffracting crystals , however , has prevented structure determination by crystallography of actomyosin complexes . Thus , although structural models exist of F - actin in complex with various myosins 8 – 11 , a high - resolution structure of the F - actin – myosin complex is missing . Here , using electron cryomicroscopy , we present the structure of a human rigor actomyosin complex at an average resolution of 3 . 9 Å . The structure reveals details of the actomyosin interface , which is mainly stabilized by hydrophobic interactions . The negatively charged amino ( N ) terminus of actin interacts with a conserved basic motif in loop 2 of myosin , promoting cleft closure in myosin . Surprisingly , the overall structure of myosin is similar to rigor - like myosin structures in the absence of F - actin , indicating that F - actin binding induces only minimal conformational changes in myosin . A comparison with pre - powerstroke and intermediate ( P i - release ) 7 states of myosin allows us to discuss the general mechanism of myosin binding to F - actin . Our results serve as a strong foundation for the molecular understanding of cytoskeletal diseases , such as autosomal dominant hearing loss and diseases affecting skeletal and cardiac muscles , in particular nemaline myopathy and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy . Using electron cryomicroscopy ( cryo - EM ) and single - particle - based analysis of helical specimens ( Methods ) , we determined the structure a human actomyosin – tropomyosin ( ATM ) complex , composed of the motor domain of non - muscular myosin - 2C ( NM - 2C ) , cytoplasmic γ 1 - F - actin and cytoplasmic tropomyosin 3 . 1 ( Fig . 1 , Extended Data Figs 1a – g and 2 and Supplementary Video 1 ) . We also reprocessed our previous F - actin – tropomyosin data set 12 and obtained an improved reconstruction at 3 . 6 Å resolution ( Extended Data Figs 1h – k and 2a ) . The density of tropomyosin did not improve in both data sets and is limited to ~ 7 Å as described previously 12 . The ATM structure reveals that myosin interacts intimately with F - actin ( Fig . 1a ) . The overall organization of the ATM complex is similar to that described in our previous structure of the complex 1 Department of Structural Biochemistry , Max Planck Institute of Molecular Physiology , 44227 Dortmund , Germany . 2 Institute for Biophysical Chemistry , Hannover Medical School , 30625 Hannover , Germany . 3 Division for Structural Analysis , Hannover Medical School , 30625 Hannover , Germany . † Current address : Laboratory of Molecular Physiology , National Heart , Lung , and Blood Institute , National Institutes of Health , Bethesda , Maryland 20892 , USA .

However , given the superior resolution of our present structure , we could clearly identify large side chains and therefore reveal most intermolecular interactions between F - actin and myosin in detail . The large interface between the two proteins is formed mainly between the helix – loop – helix ( HLH ) motif and surface loops of myosin ( CM - loop , loop 2 , loop 3 , loop 4 , and ‘activation’ loop 13 ) and the subdomain ( SD ) 1 and 2 of one actin subunit and SD2 ( D - loop ) of the adjacent actin subunit as previously predicted 9 – 11 ( Fig . 1b – d and Supplementary Video 3 ) . Tpm3 . 1 , which is resolved to ~ 7 Å , is in the same position as skeletal muscle tropomyosin 1 . 1 ( Tpm1 . 1 ) in our previous structure , namely the M - state 10 , interacting with loop 4 of myosin and SD3 of actin ( Figs 1b , c and 2a ) . Interestingly , although Tpm3 . 1 is shorter ( stretching over six actin subunits ) than Tpm1 . 1 ( stretching over seven actin subu - nits ) , the pitch of the coiled - coil structure is equivalent . Tpm3 . 1 , which is mainly negatively charged on its surface , interacts with arginine 384 of loop 4 , indicating electrostatic interactions ( Fig . 2a ) . In addition , the negatively charged residue D387 on loop 4 ( N377 – D393 ) interacts with a positively charged region on F - actin ( K325 , K327 ) ( Fig . 2b ) . Notably , in the absence of myosin , these actin residues directly interact with tropomyosin ( A - state ) 12 . The HLH motif ( L550 – E575 ) in the lower 50 - kDa ( L50 ) domain of NM - 2C plays an essential role in strong binding of myosin to F - actin ( Figs 1c , d and 2c , d ) . It enters a hydrophobic groove on actin that is formed between two adjacent actin subunits comprising SD1 and SD3 of one and the D - loop ( R38 – V53 ) of the adjacent subunit . In particular , the hydrophobic loop of the HLH motif interacts with the hydro - phobic groove and F560 is completely immersed into a hydrophobic cavity resembling a lock - and - key interaction ( Fig . 2d , Extended Data Fig . 3a – d and Supplementary Video 4 ) . The key role of F560 for the actomyosin interaction has also been shown by mutational analyses in which a F560A mutation resulted in a complete disruption of motility , whereas alanine mutants of the directly adjacent W559 and P561 showed only one - tenth the motility compared with wild type 14 . Interestingly , compared with its position in the pre - powerstroke ( PPS ) state the loop is the only part of the HLH motif that alters its position upon actin binding , stressing its important role in the actin – myosin interaction ( Extended Data Fig . 3a , c ) . In addition to the hydrophobic contacts , there are also two elec - trostatic interactions that stabilize the HLH motif binding to F - actin . E570 probably forms a salt bridge with K49 of the D - loop and E556 interacts with the backbone of S349 and T350 in SD1 of F - actin ( Fig . 2c , Extended Data Fig . 3b , e and Supplementary Video 4 ) . Both residues are part of a highly conserved acidic patch in several myosin classes ( Extended Data Fig . 3e , f ) , and a single point muta - tion ( E556Q ) in myosin results in a tenfold reduced F - actin binding affinity 15 . The cardiomyopathy loop ( CM - loop ) , forming one antiparallel β - strand pair ( T417 – T432 ) , is the major site of the myosin upper 50 - kDa ( U50 ) domain that interacts with actin ( Figs 1c , and 2e , f and Supplementary Video 4 ) . The CM - loop is fully ordered and the interface with actin is mainly stabilized by hydrophobic interactions ( Fig . 2f ) , supported by weak electrostatic interactions at the tip and the base of the CM - loop ( Fig . 2e ) . K429 , which is found in all myosin - II isoforms ( Extended Data Fig . 4a , b ) , interacts with a negatively charged patch on F - actin formed mainly by D24 and E333 in SD1 and SD3 , respectively ( Fig . 2e ) . In addition , the positively charged tip ( R424 ) interacts with the negatively charged region around E55 and D92 of F - actin ( Fig . 2e ) . However , residue 424 is only positively charged in smooth and non - muscular isoforms of myosin ( Extended Data Fig . 4b ) and therefore does not play a role in skeletal and cardiac muscles . Importantly , we did not find any prominent possible salt bridges that would stabilize the contacts between the CM - loop and F - actin , supporting previous mutagenesis studies suggesting that charged residues , in particular the highly conserved residue D425 , play a minor role in this interface 14 , 16 . As speculated previously 8 , the highly conserved and disease - related residue R419 ( R403 in β - cardiac myosin ) indeed does not directly interact with F - actin ( Fig . 2e , Extended Data Fig . 4b – d and Supplementary Video 4 ) . In our structure , R419 clearly interacts with Y426 on the opposing strand of the CM - loop , thereby bridging and stabilizing the conformation of the loop ( Fig . 2e ) . Both residues are highly con - served , suggesting that this bridge is present in all myosin - II isoforms ( Extended Data Fig . 4b ) . Many disease - causing mutations are found in the region of the CM - loop , demonstrating the high importance of the CM - loop for the strong binding between actin and myosin ( Extended Data Fig . 4b – e ) . Several studies showed that loop 2 , connecting the L50 and U50 domains in myosin ( W638 – T669 ) , plays a major role in the initial binding to F - actin 14 , 15 , 17 – 19 . We see clear density for loop 2 in the ATM structure . However , whereas the base of the loop is ordered , the rest of the loop is more flexible ( Fig . 3a , b ) . It occupies a large predominantly hydrophobic surface of the actin SD1 domain ( Fig . 3c and Extended Data Fig . 5a , b ) . A conserved hydrophobic patch at the carboxy ( C ) - terminal base of loop 2 ( G665 – F667 ) and the tip of helix - R ( W559 ) ( Fig . 3c , Extended Data Fig . 3f and Supplementary Video 4 ) interacts with a hydrophobic groove of actin SD1 ( Fig . 3c and Extended Data Fig . 3d ) . Mutagenesis studies showed that especially W559 is essential for forming the F - actin – myosin interface and obtaining motility 14 , 20 .

Interestingly , the adjacent conserved positively charged region ( R661 – R664 ) interacts with the acidic N terminus of actin and a negatively charged area ( D23 , D24 ) of SD1 ( Fig . 3d , Extended Data Fig . 5b and Supplementary Video 4 ) . While one of the conserved arginines ( R663 ) forms a possible salt bridge with actin E3 ( Fig . 3d ) , the other one ( R664 ) interacts with D640 and D642 at the other end of loop 2 , forming an electrostatic belt that stabilizes the base of loop 2 ( Fig . 3c ) . Notably , D640 and D642 are only conserved in myosins with a long loop 2 ( Extended Data Fig . 5c ) , suggesting that the electrostatic belt is not required for myosins with a shorter loop 2 . In line with our previous observation 10 , loop 3 ( Q576 – D593 ) forms the so - called Milligan - contact 9 , 21 connecting the L50 domain to SD1 of the adjacent actin subunit ( Figs 1c and 2g and Extended Data Fig . 5d , e ) . The small interface is only formed by complementary charged surfaces and not by specific salt bridges as previously expected ( Fig . 2g ) . The weak nature of the interactions , and the fact that not all myosin isoforms have a long loop 3 that can form this contact 22 , suggest that , for most myosin proteins , loop 3 plays only an ancillary role in strong F - actin binding . Several studies suggested that a proline - rich loop in the L50 domain , a so - called activation loop ( I541 – G549 ) , is directly involved in activa - tion of myosin by interacting with the negatively charged N terminus of actin 13 , 23 . Our ATM structure confirms that this loop is part of the actomyosin interface . Together with helix - W and the base of loop 2 , it forms a positively charged basin that interacts with the negatively charged N terminus of actin ( Fig . 3d , Extended Data Fig . 6a , b and Supplementary Video 4 ) . However , R543 , which is the only positively charged residue of the loop and conserved in myosin - II ( Extended Data Fig . 6c ) , points away from the interface and therefore cannot be involved in a direct interaction with the glutamates of the actin N terminus ( Fig . 4b and Extended Data Fig . 6d ) . In other myosins with shorter activation loops , namely myosin - V , myosin - VI or Dictyostelium myosin - II , the position of the positively charged residue is shifted by one position and would therefore allow a direct interaction with the N terminus ( Extended Data Fig . 6c , e , f ) . Compared with the PPS conformation , the proline - rich loop orients slightly closer to F - actin ( Extended Data Fig . 6b ) . Since the actin - induced conformational changes in the proline - rich loop and the adjacent relay helix are minor , we conclude that they are probably not responsible for a direct activa - tion of myosin and therefore suggest using the term supporting loop rather than activation loop . To identify myosin - induced conformational changes in F - actin , we compared the ATM structure with our reprocessed F - actin – tropomyosin structure . As expected from our previous observations 10 , the overall changes are minimal . Whereas the D - loop and other interface regions orient slightly towards myosin ( Fig . 4c and Extended Data Fig . 3a ) , areas interacting with the CM - loop and more distal regions of actin only move marginally away from the interface ( Extended Data Fig . 7a – c ) . The most prominent changes occur at the N and C termini of actin ( Fig . 4b , c and Extended Data Fig . 7d – k ) . The highly conserved and negatively charged N terminus ( Extended Data Fig . 7c ) , which is only partly resolved in F - actin 12 , but essential for myosin binding 24 – 26 , is completely ordered in the ATM structure and pulled into a positively charged basin on the myosin structure ( Fig . 4b , c and Extended Data Fig . 6a ) . Two glutamates at its tip ( E2 , E3 ) are potentially involved in salt bridges with positively charged residues on helix - W and loop 2 ( Fig . 3d ) . The conformational change of the N terminus is partly trans - mitted to the nucleotide - binding pocket ( Extended Data Fig . 7e , f ) . Actin residues D10 and K17 slightly change their position ( Extended Data Fig . 7f , g ) ; however , this does not considerably alter the position of ADP and Mg 2 + ( Extended Data Fig . 7f , h ) .

This is in line with previous studies showing that myosin binding to F - actin results in quenching of fluorescence of pyrene - labelled actin at C373 ( C374 in α - actin ) 14 . The higher myosin - induced stability of the D - loop , N terminus and surrounding regions is prob - ably responsible for the stabilization of the C terminus , which is not well ordered in the F - actin – tropomyosin structure 12 ( Extended Data Fig . 7j ) . We believe that the minimal but substantial myosin - induced conformational changes are exemplary for most actin – myosin interac - tions . We therefore suggest using the term M - state for F - actin bound to myosin in contrast to A - state for bare F - actin ( Figs 1a and 4c ) . To understand which conformational changes F - actin binding induces in myosin , we compared our rigor ATM structure with rigor - like crystal structures ( Extended Data Fig . 8 ) . Surprisingly , the overall structures of the different rigor - like states are very similar com - pared with that of the rigor state ( Extended Data Fig . 8a , b ) , indicating that F - actin induces only minimal conformational changes in myosin as previously predicted 11 , 27 . Differences are found at actin - interacting loops that are partly ordered in the crystal structures and are stabilized by actin in the ATM structure ( Extended Data Fig . 8c ) . In addition , we found that the converter and lever arm regions differ in their position relative to the rest of the protein ( Extended Data Fig . 8d ) . Importantly , the comparison between rigor and rigor - like structures shows that F - actin stabilizes the closed conformation of myosin , but does not induce major additional conformational changes . To gain further insight into how actin accommodates first a weak and then a strong myosin - binding state , we compared our rigor NM - 2C structure with the crystal structure of the same protein in the PPS state . On the basis of recently determined crystal structures of the motor domain of myosin - VI in the P i - release state , an important intermediate state , a detailed mechanism of myosin binding to F - actin has been proposed 7 . To obtain the best possible approximation for an F - actin – NM - 2C complex in the P i - release state , we used a two - step approach . First , we calculated a homology model of the P i - release state of NM - 2C on the basis of the atomic model of myosin - VI ( ref . 7 ) . On the basis of the positions of actin and myosin in our rigor actomyosin structure and the myosin PPS structure , we then performed different alignments of the P i - release state model to obtain a model for the actomyosin complex in its P i - release state ( Fig . 5 and Extended Data Fig . 9a – c ) . Exclusive alignment to the U50 domain in all states would cause steric clashes with F - actin in the P i - release state ( Extended Data Fig . 9a ) . Alignment to the L50 domain would result in a rotation of the U50 away from F - actin before the final strong binding ( Extended Data Fig . 9b ) . We therefore chose a combined alignment instead ( Extended Data Fig . 9c and Supplementary Video 5 ) to describe the possible global conformational changes during myosin binding ( Extended Data Fig . 9d – f , Fig . 5 and Supplementary Video 6 ) . We aligned the P i - release state model first to the L50 domain of the rigor state . The PPS state was then aligned to the U50 domain of the P i - release state . There is general agreement that loop 2 initiates weak binding of myosin - ADP - P i to F - actin by interacting with the SD1 and SD3 of one actin subunit 14 , 15 , 17 – 19 ( Extended Data Fig . 9d ) . This brings both the L50 and U50 close to F - actin ( Fig . 5a ) . As proposed in ref . 7 , the L50 domain rotates and binds to actin , resulting in the P i - release state that repre - sents the initial strong binding state of myosin . The interface is mainly mediated by hydrophobic interactions of the HLH domain with SD1 , SD3 and the D - loop and hydrophilic interactions with the N terminus of actin , in line with our previous prediction 10 ( Fig . 5b ) . On the basis of our results , we propose that this process stabilizes the base of loop 2 ( Extended Data Fig . 9e , Fig . 5b and Supplementary Video 6 ) , creating a positively charged patch to which the negatively charged strut ( bridge between L50 and U50 ) is attracted ( Extended Data Fig . 9f and Fig . 5b ) . Thus , the base of loop 2 acts as a key region that shifts the equilibrium between the open and closed actin - binding cleft 28 towards the closed conformation , in which F - actin directly interacts with the CM - loop and loop 4 of the U50 domain ( Fig . 5c ) . Notably , both the strut and the highly conserved basic region at the base of loop 2 have previously been shown to be essential for strong binding 17 , 27 , 29 . In our model , the closure of the cleft is mediated by a rotation of the U50 domain towards F - actin and not by a back - rotation of the L50 domain ( Fig . 5c ) . As described before ( reviewed in ref . 4 ) , cleft closure results in the strong binding of myosin to actin , providing the necessary anchoring of the motor domain for the subsequent powerstroke ( Fig . 5c ) . The time point and effect of P i and ADP release during this process is highly debated 7 , 30 . Because we lack high - resolution structures of intermediate states of myosin bound to F - actin , we cannot determine whether P i is 4 . U50 rotates and binds 2 . L50 rotates and binds 1 .

However , our observation that the rigor state is very similar to the rigor - like state suggests that actin promotes and stabilizes the closed conformation of myosin , ultimately resulting in the release of phosphate and ADP .

The investigators were not blinded to allocation during experiments and outcome assessment . Protein expression and purification . G - actin ( γ 1 - actin , ACTG1 from Homo sapiens ) was recombinantly expressed using the baculovirus / Sf9 - cell system and purified as described previously 31 , 32 . Afterwards , the sample was polymerized to F - actin by increasing the salt concentration to 100 mM KCl and 2 mM MgCl 2 . Tropomyosin 3 . 1 ( TPM3 from H . sapiens , isoform Tpm3 . 1 ) was expressed and purified from Escherichia coli on the basis of the protocol of ref . 33 with no addi - tional modifications . The motor domain of non - muscular myosin - 2C ( MYH14 , isoform 2 from H . sapiens ) consisting of amino acids 1 – 799 was directly fused to an artificial lever arm ( spectrin repeats 1 and 2 from α - actinin ) 34 and a C - terminal Flag - tag . The protein was recombinantly overproduced in the Sf9 / baculovirus system as previously described 34 and purified via Flag capture and size - exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 26 / 60 – 200 prep grade column . Before grid prepara - tion for electron microscopy studies , the F - actin sample was spun down ( 100 , 000 g ) and carefully suspended in nucleotide - free F - actin buffer ( 5 mM Tris - HCl pH 7 . 5 , 1 mM DTT , 100 mM KCl , and 2 mM MgCl 2 ) . The actomyosin complex was prepared by mixing F - actin with tropomyosin initially at a molar ratio of 7 : 1 . The final concentration of tropomyosin for frozen specimens was then adjusted empir - ically to obtain complete decoration and only little unbound tropomyosin in the background by standard negatively stained studies as described previously 12 . The F - actin – tropomyosin filaments were decorated with myosin during preparation of vitrified sample grids ( see below ) . Optimized grid preparation and image acquisition for cryo - EM . Best condi - tions for reconstituting the F - actin – tropomyosin complex were screened by using the negatively staining protocol as described above . When myosin was incubated in solution with the optimized F - actin – tropomyosin sample before applying the sample to the grid , we always obtained only bundles of fully myosin - decorated actin filaments . Because of this , we optimized the protocol to reconstitute the full actomyosin filaments with reduced bundling on a grid . Therefore , the normal cryo - preparation protocol was changed . First we applied 2 μ l of F - actin – tropomyosin solution to a glow - discharged holey carbon grid ( C - flats 2 / 1 , Protochips ) , incubated for 20 s and manually blotted from the backside for less than a second with filter paper . A thin layer of solution stayed on the grid and the filaments where pre - straightened in the holes . Afterwards , 1 . 5 μ l of myosin solution ( 3 μ M in F - actin buffer without nucleotide ) were added directly on the grid , incubated for 10 s and then manually blotted for 5 s from the backside with filter paper ( Whatman no . 5 ) , before vitrification by plunging the grid into liquid ethane using a Cp3 plunger ( Gatan ) . Screening for the best sample and blotting conditions was performed on a JEOL JEM 3200FSC electron microscope equipped with a field emission gun and oper - ated at a voltage of 200 kV . The omega in - column energy filter of the microscope was used to estimate best ice conditions ( ~ 70 – 100 nm thickness ) . Finally , a data set was taken with a spherical aberration - corrected FEI Titan Krios transmission electron microscope equipped with an extra - high brightness field emission gun ( X - FEG ) and operated at a voltage of 300 kV . Although the sample preparation pro - tocol was optimized , we had to screen and choose usable grid squares extensively . Images were recorded with a back - thinned 4k × 4k FEI Falcon 2 direct detection camera under minimal dose conditions using the automatic data collection software EPU ( FEI ) . Within each selected grid hole , three different positions were imaged , each with a total exposure of 1 s and a frame recording time of 55 ms . Seven frames from 85 to 475 ms with a total dose of ~ 16 electrons per square ångström and one total average ( integrated image ) with an electron dose of ~ 35 electrons per square ångström were used for image processing . The used magnification of 125 , 000 ( nominal magnification of 59 , 000 ) corresponds to a pixel size of 1 . 1 Å . The defocus range of the data set was 0 . 7 – 2 . 8 μ m ( Extended Data Table 1 ) . Image processing of the cryo - EM data set . In total , we collected ~ 6 , 300 images in two sessions . Despite the extensive pre - screening of grid squares before starting automatic data collection ( see above ) , we deleted ~ 68 % of the recorded images because of bundled filaments , contaminations or bad ice quality . Resulting frames were aligned and afterwards summed up using motion correction 35 . The drift - corrected averages were used for determination of defocus and astigmatism values with CTFFIND3 36 . Filaments were manually selected ( Extended Data Fig . 1a ) and exported from the 1 s integrated images using sxhelixboxer in SPARX 37 without changing the orientation of the filaments to the y axis . A total of ~ 138 , 000 seg - ments were extracted with a box size of 256 pixels and a boxing distance of 29 pixels ( overlap ~ 90 % ) . Thus , the approximate distance between them ( ~ 32 Å ) slightly exceeded the rise of the helical assembly of actin ( ~ 27 – 28 Å ) . The same procedure was applied to the drift - corrected average and all individual frames . Afterwards all segments were transformed to RELION 38 - readable image stack formats and initial metadata files were created for further refinement steps in RELION . First , two - dimensional reference - free classification and sorting of bad classes from the integrated images led to a resulting data set of 126 , 000 particles ( Extended Data Fig . 1b ) . The resulting data set was used in several rounds of three - dimensional auto - refinements with particles from the integrated images and local three - dimensional auto - refinements with the particles from the drift - corrected averages . The refinement showed an expected Gaussian distribution of projection direction around the filament axis ( Extended Data Fig . 1d , e ) . To improve processing time , we limited the tilt angle afterwards ( Extended Data Fig . 1d ) . Finally , we applied a particle - based movie refinement and frame weighting 39 and continued three - dimensional auto - refinements with the resulting contrast - enhanced particles . We did not make use of helical symmetry during refinement but masked F - actin and myosin in the outer regions to focus the refinement on the central parts . Initially , we applied a standard spherical mask ( diameter 270 Å , Extended Data Fig . 1d ) to the reconstruction . After a global refinement with the spherical mask , we continued with local refinement and a mask at the size of seven F - actin subunits and six myosin molecules . We used a preliminary model and the ‘Colour zone’ and ‘Split Map’ options in CHIMERA 40 , 41 to extract the central part of the map from the current density map . From this part of the map we calculated a smoothed mask with the ‘relion _ mask _ create’ function in RELION . To evaluate the results , we again performed a two - dimensional classification with projection parameters derived from three - dimensional refinement ( Extended Data Fig . 1c ) . In single class averages , we could already detect secondary structure elements ( Extended Data Fig . 1f , g ) . As a final sorting step , we deleted particles , which were outliers with respect to their neighbouring segments coming from the same filament . Therefore , we kept track throughout the whole processing steps to know to which filament each particle belongs . This resulted in 118 , 000 particles , which we used for a local three - dimensional auto - refinement . In the final iteration , we applied a mask of the central five F - actin subunits and two central myosin mole - cules ( coloured region in Fig . 1a ) . This mask was created as described above for the mask of seven F - actin subunits and six myosin molecules . Outer regions of the lever arm were also excluded . Fourier shell correlation ( FSC ) analysis was performed within the central area ( five F - actin subunits and two myosin molecules ) of the volume , resulting in an average resolution of 3 . 9 Å ( FSC 0 . 143 criterion 42 ) for the F - actin – myosin electron density map ( Extended Data Fig . 2a ) . The density map of F - actin – myosin was then sharpened using a negative b factor of – 200 Å 2 and filtered to its nominal resolu - tion . Because tropomyosin was masked out during refinements as we did before 12 , we filtered the tropomyosin density map to ~ 7 Å and merged it with the final F - actin – myosin map to obtain a map of the entire F - actin – myosin – tropomyosin complex . Local resolution was estimated using ResMap 43 on the full density map without masking ( Extended Data Fig . 2b ) , revealing a resolution gradient from higher ( ~ 3 . 5 Å , F - actin core ) to lower ( 4 . 5 Å - 5 Å , outer myosin domains ) values , which could be a result of induced forces from the protruded lever arm ( Extended Data Fig . 2c – e ) . We converted the local resolution map to absolute frequencies and applied a local filtering algorithm on the final map with sxfilterlocal in SPARX . To estimate and confirm the helical symmetry of the actomyosin complex , we used the symmetry search function of sxhelicon _ utils in SPARX . We reprocessed our previous F - actin – tropomyosin 12 data set with the same protocol as described above ( Extended Data Fig . 1h – k ) and obtained an improved reconstruction at an average resolution of 3 . 6 Å for the central five F - actin subu - nits ( Extended Data Fig . 2a ) . During the helical reconstruction approach , several asymmetrical units are averaged by symmetrization . This results in a decrease of resolution in flexible and bent regions . However , using the single particle approach , we refine only on the central region , thereby probably decreasing the influence of flexibility induced by the bending of the filament . This probably improves the resolution of the resulting reconstruction . For each data set , we provide two density maps in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank ( EMDB ) databank . One entry contains the map after ‘post - processing’ in RELION without masking , the other one the same map locally filtered , masked and merged with the filtered tropomyosin density map at its respective position ( as described above ) . Atomic model building and refinement . The central F - actin subunit ( chain A ) and the central myosin molecules ( chain F , G ) show all available contacts to adja - cent chains ( B , C , D , E ) and were therefore used for further structural analysis . We used our previous F - actin model 12 as a starting model for F - actin and the highly homologous model of rigor - like NM - 2B ( PDB accession number 4PD3 44 ) for myosin . We performed homology modelling with the respective sequences of both proteins using MODELLER 45 . Derived models were rigid - body fitted into the density map , using ‘Fit in Map’ and the map was segmented with ‘Split Map’ in CHIMERA 40 , 41 . Additionally , models were flexibly fitted with iMODFIT 46 into the respective density maps . Finally , the flexibly fitted models were used to create a starting F - actin – myosin model . The electron density was converted to © 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited . All rights reserved Letter reSeArCH structure factors with the CCP4 program suite 47 . The model and the density map were then used for real space refinement and model building in COOT 48 . Flexible parts of the N terminus ( residues 1 – 49 ) , loop 1 ( residues 222 – 232 ) , loop 2 ( residues 640 – 661 ) and lever arm ( residues 817 – 1039 ) of myosin were deleted from the model . Some parts ( especially surface loops and termini ) of F - actin and myosin were built de novo . Domains showing resolution lower than 4 . 5 Å ( outer myosin regions ) were not manually changed and only the backbone trace was optimized . The resulting model was refined in REFMAC , using the modified version of the program for cryo - EM maps 49 and applying secondary structure and reference restraints derived by ProSMART 50 . In addition , we added non - crystallographic symmetry restraints for F - actin ( chain A – E ) and myosin ( chain F and G ) . To prevent overfitting , we first determined refinement settings by refining the model ( atoms randomly displaced by 0 . 5 Å ) only versus a density map belonging to one half of the data set and compared the FSC curves of the refined model with both half maps ( Extended Data Fig . 2f ) . Finally , the model was refined versus the full map with the derived refinement parameters , which did not show significant differences in the two FSC curves ( Extended Data Fig . 2f ) . We used MOLPROBITY 51 to evaluate the resulting atomic model . The data statistics are given in Extended Data Table 1 . For the reprocessed F - actin – tropomyosin data set , we used the same refine - ment strategies as for the actomyosin data set . The final data statistics are given in Extended Data Table 1 . Fit of the tropomyosin models . To describe the interaction between F - actin – myosin and tropomyosin , we used the tropomyosin model from our previous structure 10 . As already described in the main text , the pitch of the coiled - coil structure is equivalent . We directly rigid - body fitted the tropomyosin model ( PDB acces - sion number 4A7F ) into the density map , using ‘Fit in Map’ in CHIMERA 40 . We reduced the model to the five central pseudo - repeats as before 12 and shifted the residue numbering regarding the differences from long Tpm1 . 1 to the shorter Tpm3 . 1 . Owing to the limited resolution of the cryo - EM density in the region of tropomyosin , we avoided interpretation of tropomyosin at the single amino - acid level . For the reprocessed F - actin – tropomyosin model , we could use the tropomyosin model from our previous model ( PDB accession number 3JA8 ) , as the structure and resolution in that region did not differ . Structure analysis and visualization . For visualization of models and density maps in all figures and videos , we used CHIMERA 40 . The actomyosin complex was protonated using H + + ( ref . 52 ) at pH 7 . 5 , and the electrostatic Coulomb potential of the filament surface was calculated ranging from − 10 to + 10 kcal mol − 1 . For vis - ualization of the hydrophobicity per amino - acid residue , we used ‘Define attribute’ in CHIMERA and generated amino - acid - specific scores 53 . The densities of flexible parts of myosin were detected by using the ‘Colour Zone’ function on a low - pass - filtered density map in CHIMERA 41 . For comparison of differences in density of A - state and M - state F - actin , we low - pass filtered both density maps to the same resolution of 3 . 9 Å . Sequence alignments were performed using the ClustalOmega online server 54 . The HGMD 55 library and UNIPROT 56 were browsed to find mutations in regions of interest . For creating a homology model of NM - 2C in the P i - release state , we used MODELLER in the CHIMERA ‘Multalign viewer’ - interface with NM - 2C as target sequence and the coordinates of the previously determined crystal structure of the P i - release state of myosin - VI ( PDB accession number 4PFO ) 7 as reference structure . 31 .

All rights reserved Letter reSeArCH Extended Data Figure 9 | Different alignments of models for weak to strong binding of myosin and strut attraction to the base of loop2 promotes cleft closure . a – c , Three possible alignments of myosin in the PPS ( first column , purple , PDB accession number 5I4E ) , P i - release ( second column , blue ) and rigor ( third column , red ) states are illustrated with respect to F - actin . For better visualization , differences in F - actin are not shown and F - actin is only depicted in the M - state ( green , cyan ) . The P i - release state represents a homology model of NM - 2C based on a crystal structure of myosin in the P i - release state 7 ( PBD accession number 4PFO , see Methods ) . All models are either aligned to the U50 domain ( a ) or the L50 domain ( b ) of the rigor state . In c , the model of the P i - release state was first aligned to the L50 domain of the rigor state . The PPS state was then aligned to the U50 domain of model of the P i - release state . The first row in each subfigure shows changes in the U50 domain from the top ( for a better visualization L50 was deleted ) . The second row shows the L50 domain from the bottom ( U50 is transparent ) . Possible clashes are indicated by a yellow star ( a ) . d – f , Binding mechanism of the strut , connecting L50 and U50 domains , to the stabilized base of loop 2 . To illustrate the conformational changes , the respective regions in the PPS state ( PPS , purple , PDB accession number 5I4E ) and rigor state ( RS , red ) of myosin have been partly overlaid . The rest of myosin is shown in grey . L50 binds to F - actin ( A - state , yellow ) ( d , e ) . The base of loop 2 is stabilized by F - actin ( e ) and attracts the negatively charged strut with its positive patch . This promotes the binding of the strut , shifting the equilibrium to a closed conformational state of myosin ( f ) . Flexible parts of loop 2 are indicated as dotted lines . Lower panels show surfaces of the same regions as in the upper panels coloured by electrostatic Coulomb potential . For better visualization , the upper parts of the strut were removed .
