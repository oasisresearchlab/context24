SCD5 is essential , but an scd5 - (cid:1) 338 mutant , expressing Scd5p with a C - terminal truncation of 338 amino acids , is temperature sensitive for growth . Further studies here demonstrate that scd5 - (cid:1) 338 affects recep - tor - mediated and ﬂuid - phase endocytosis and normal actin organization . The scd5 - (cid:1) 338 mutant contains larger and depolarized cortical actin patches and a prevalence of G - actin bars . scd5 - (cid:1) 338 also displays synthetic negative genetic interactions with mutations in several other proteins important for cortical actin organization and endocytosis . Moreover , Scd5p colocalizes with cortical actin . Analysis has revealed that clathrin - deﬁcient yeast also have a major defect in cortical actin organization and accumulate G - actin . Overexpression of SCD5 partially suppresses the actin defect of clathrin mutants , whereas combining scd5 - (cid:1) 338 with a clathrin mutation exacerbates the actin and endocytic phenotypes . Both Scd5p and yeast clathrin physically associate with Sla2p , a homologue of the mammalian huntingtin interacting protein HIP1 and the related HIP1R . Fur - thermore , Sla2p localization at the cell cortex is dependent on Scd5p and clathrin function . Therefore , Scd5p and clathrin are important for actin organization and endocytosis , and Sla2p may provide a critical link between clathrin and the actin cytoskeleton in yeast , similar to HIP1 ( R ) in animal cells . INTRODUCTION A major pathway for endocytosis involves the coat protein clathrin , comprised of heavy and light chains ( HC and LC ) and a large number of accessory factors . These proteins facilitate cargo capture , assembly of the clathrin lattice , membrane invagination , pinching off , and then uncoating of the vesicle once detached from the membrane . Many of these accessory proteins are held together by the cooperative interaction of different binding domains and appear to form a web beneath the cell surface ( D’Hondt et al . , 2000 ; Brodsky et al . , 2001 ) , although the role of the majority of these com - ponents and how they are regulated is still not completely understood . Saccharomyces cerevisiae also contains clathrin HC and LC ( Chc1p and Clc1p ) ; however , there is only a partial depen - dence on clathrin for uptake at the cell surface ( Payne et al . , 1988 ; Tan et al . , 1993 ; Huang et al . , 1997 ) . On the other hand , the actin cytoskeleton appears to be essential for endocytosis in yeast , as genetic screens to identify factors involved in internalization have repeatedly uncovered proteins impor - tant for function of the cortical actin cytoskeleton ( for re - views see Baggett and Wendland , 2001 ; D’Hondt et al . , 2000 ) . Interestingly , many of these factors , or proteins that interact with these factors , are related to molecules that function in clathrin - mediated endocytosis in animal cells . For example , cortical actin patch components Rvs161p and Rvs167p are related to amphiphysins , which bind to clathrin HC , the heterotetrameric adaptor AP - 2 , and other regulatory com - ponents involved in clathrin - coated vesicle ( CCV ) formation in animal cells ( David et al . , 1996 ; McPherson et al . , 1996 ; Ramjaun and McPherson , 1998 ; Slepnev et al . , 2000 ) .

Animal Eps15 has an AP - 2 binding region and interacts with NPF motifs via the EH domain in proteins like epsin , which in turn has clathrin and AP - 2 binding domains ( Benmerah et al . , 1996 ; Di Fiore et al . , 1997 ; Iannolo et al . , 1997 ; Chen et al . , 1998 ; Drake et al . , 2000 ) . Yeast Pan1p is in a complex with End3p and another cortical actin patch component , Sla1p and has recently been shown to activate Arp2 / 3 complexes ( Tang et al . , 2000 ; Duncan et al . , 2001 ; Zeng et al . , 2001 ) . This Pan1p function may couple actin polymerization to the en - docytic machinery . Interestingly , Pan1p binds to NPF motifs in the yeast epsin - related proteins , Ent1 / 2p , and AP180 / CALM - like proteins , Yap180p’s , which are associated with cortical patches but also directly bind to clathrin HC in yeast ( Wendland and Emr , 1998 ; Wendland et al . , 1999 ) . AP180 / CALM promote the assembly of clathrin lattices in vitro and bind AP - 2 , and functional studies indicate that these pro - teins are also important components of the endocytic ma - chinery in animal cells ( McMahon , 1999 ; Traub et al . , 1999 ) . A role for cortical actin in endocytosis in animal cells has been less clear , because actin - depolymerizing drugs , e . g . , latrunculin A ( Lat - A ) , disrupt clathrin - mediated endocytosis in some cell types or under some growth conditions but not in others ( Fujimoto et al . , 2000 ; Qualmann et al . , 2000 ; Apo - daca , 2001 ) . Also , in some polarized epithelial cells such drug treatments inhibit internalization at the apical surface but not the basolateral membrane ( Apodaca , 2001 ) . Al - though actin may not be absolutely required for endocytosis in animal cells , other recent results support an important association of the actin cytoskeleton with clathrin - coated pits . Treatment of cells with Lat - A increases the lateral mo - bility of clathrin - coated pits at the cell surface , suggesting that cytoskeletal elements may localize the endocytic ma - chinery to domains of the plasma membrane ( Gaidarov et al . , 1999 ; Bennett et al . , 2001 ) . In addition , a few proteins that associate with both the actin cytoskeleton and clathrin - coated pit components have been identiﬁed . Two of these factors , mAbp1p and HIP1 / HIP1R , were ﬁrst identiﬁed in yeast as actin - associated proteins Abp1 or Sla2p ( also known as End4p ) or in screens for endocytic mutants ( Drubin et al . , 1990 ; Holtzman et al . , 1993 ; Raths et al . , 1993 ) . mAbp1 has an actin - binding region and a SH3 domain that also interacts with dynamin , and overexpression of the SH3 domain in - hibits receptor - mediated endocytosis in animal cells ( Kessels et al . , 2001 ) . HIP1 was identiﬁed as a huntingtin interacting protein and is closely related to HIP1R ( Kalchman et al . , 1997 ; Wanker et al . , 1997 ; Seki et al . , 1998 ; Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 1999 ) . These proteins , as well as Sla2p , contain an epsin N - terminal homology ( ENTH ) domain found in epsin and AP180 / CALM , which may help to recruit these proteins to the plasma membrane by binding cell surface phosphoi - nositides ( Ford et al . , 2001 ; Itoh et al . , 2001 ) . The C terminus of the yeast and mammalian Sla2p - related proteins is ho - mologous to the talin - like F - actin binding module ( McCann and Craig , 1997 ) . The central region of HIP1 / HIP1R , which includes a coiled - coiled segment , has recently been shown to bind directly to clathrin and facilitates association with clathrin - coated pits ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2001 ; Metzler et al . , 2001 ; Mishra et al . , 2001 ; Waelter et al . , 2001 ; Legendre - Guillemin et al . , 2002 ) . Although yeast Sla2p binds actin , shows partial colocalization with cortical actin patches , and is important for cortical actin organization and endocytosis ( Holtzman et al . , 1993 ; Raths et al . , 1993 ; Wesp et al . , 1997 ) , no connection to clathrin - mediated trafﬁcking has been re - ported . In previous studies we identiﬁed the SCD5 gene as a multicopy suppressor of clathrin HC - deﬁcient yeast ( Nelson and Lemmon , 1993 ; Nelson et al . , 1996 ) . Here we demon - strate that Scd5p is important for actin organization and endocytosis . This ﬁnding led us to examine actin localization in cells lacking clathrin . We ﬁnd that similar to scd5 mutants , loss of clathrin function causes major defects in cortical actin organization , and overexpression of SCD5 partially sup - presses this defect . Moreover , two - hybrid screening with the clathrin LC has identiﬁed Sla2p as an interacting protein . Scd5p also associates with Sla2p and Sla2p’s cortical local - ization is dependent on both clathrin and Scd5p . These data suggest that clathrin and Scd5p may play a role in organiz - ing or stabilizing the cortical actin network , which is impor - tant for endocytosis in yeast . MATERIALS AND METHODS Strains , Media , and Genetic Methods Strains used in this study are listed in Table 1 . YEPD ( 2 % yeast extract , 1 % peptone , and 2 % dextrose ) , YEP - GAL ( 2 % yeast extract , 1 % peptone , and 2 % galactose ) , 5 - ﬂuoro - orotic acid ( FOA ) plates , and synthetic complete dropout media ( e . g . , complete - uracil [ C - URA ] ) were prepared as described in Nelson and Lemmon ( 1993 ) . Yeast mating , sporulation , and tetrad analysis were performed as described ( Guthrie and Fink , 1991 ) . Yeast were transformed using the method of Gietz et al . ( 1995 ) . Plasmids Plasmids were propagated in Escherichia coli DH5 (cid:1) . Important plas - mids used in this study are listed in Table 2 . A clone containing the scd5 - (cid:1) 338 truncation mutation under its own promoter was gener - ated in two steps . A 4 . 6 - kb Bam HI - Cla I SCD5 fragment was cloned into pBluescript SK (cid:2) ( Stratagene , La Jolla , CA ) . This plasmid was subjected to site directed mutagenesis by the dut (cid:3) ung (cid:3) method ( Kunkel et al . , 1987 ; McClary et al . , 1989 ) to generate pAC8 . The primer 5 (cid:4) - GAGGAAGAGTAATTTACTAAGAATTCAG - 3 (cid:4) used for mutagenesis created two stop codons at positions 535 and 536 of the Scd5p coding sequence . The mutation was veriﬁed by DNA sequencing . pAC10 was made by cloning the scd5 - (cid:1) 338 Bam HI - Cla I fragment from pAC8 into YIp5 ( Botstein et al . , 1979 ) . pJSC3 was generated by gap repair and contains scd5 - (cid:1) 338 from pAC8 in pRS315 ( Sikorski and Hieter , 1989 ) . The GFP - SCD5 construct con - tains SCD5 with the coding sequence for green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) fused in frame between codons 80 and 81 at a unique Sac I site . A PCR product for gap repair was made using primers 5 (cid:4) - CAG - AAATAATCACTCAAATACAGCAGCTGATAATGCCACTAAC - GTGAGCTCTGGTGCTGGTGCTGGTGCTGC - 3 (cid:4) and 5 (cid:4) - CA - GAAAGTGTTCGTACCTCCCCATTAGGTGGATTATCCTTT - GAGGAGAGCTCACTTTGTACAATTCATCCATACC - 3 (cid:4) and a modiﬁed YGFP3 coding sequence as a template . The modiﬁed YGFP3 contains the coding sequences for an N - terminal 5 (cid:5) GlyAla linker followed by yeast enhanced GFP - S65G , S72A ( gift of C . Schaerer - Brodbeck ) . The PCR product was cotransformed into SL1462 with YEp24 - SCD5 , which was cut with Sac I . The ﬁnal CEN , LEU2 , GFP - SCD5 plasmid , pKRH21 , was made by gap repairing a K . R . Henry et al .

Scd5p and Clathrin in Actin Function Vol . 13 , August 2002 2609 2 . 2 - kb fragment from YEp GFP - SCD5 into pCC545 gapped with Xba I . pKH19 was created by engineering a CLC1 PCR product with a 5 (cid:4) Nco I site at the CLC1 start codon and a Pvu II site downstream of the stop codon using primers 5 (cid:4) - CCATGGCAGAGAAATTC - 3 (cid:4) and 5 (cid:4) - GCGCAGCTGATCATTTAAGCACCG - 3 (cid:4) , respectively . This was transferred by subcloning into pAS2 ( Harper et al . , 1993 ) to generate pKH15 . The CLC1 ORF in pKH15 was then subcloned as a Nco I - Bam HI fragment into pACT2 ( Harper et al . , 1993 ) to yield pKH19 . pKH24 was generated by cloning a 5 . 0 - kb Cla I - Sal I fragment con - taining CHC1 into the Sma I - Xho I sites of pACT2 . This fused codons 655 - 1653 of CHC1 to the GAL4 activation domain ( GAD ) coding sequence . In pKH31 , a Bam HI fragment containing the CLC1 ORF was cloned into pGBDU - C3 ( James et al . , 1996 ) to generate a full - length CLC1 ORF fused in frame to the coding region of the GAL4 binding domain ( GBD ) . pGAD - SLA2 - ( 292 – 520 ) ( p31 - 2 ) and pGAD - SLA2 - ( 292 – 968 ) ( p31 - 10 ) were isolated from a two - hybrid screen using a LC bait ( pKH31 ) . pKH47 was generated by moving SLA2 - ( 292 – 520 ) from p31 - 2 as an Eco RI - Pst I fragment into pGBDU - C2 ( James et al . , 1996 ) . To generate pKRH20 , a 0 . 7 - kb SCD5 PCR prod - uct was made using primers 5 (cid:4) - CGGGATCCATGTCGTTTGATTG - GCTTA - 3 (cid:4) and 5 (cid:4) - CGAGATCTACACCTCCTCG - 3 (cid:4) . This produced a Bam HI site at the SCD5 start codon and a stop at codon 227 followed by a Bgl II site . This product was cloned into pGBDU - C1 ( James et al . , 1996 ) fusing SCD5 codons 1 – 227 to the GBD coding region . pNT1 was made by cloning a Xba I - Sal I fragment containing the scd5 - (cid:1) 338 mutation into the Xba I - Sal I sites of pKRH20 . This resulted in a construct coding for residues 1 – 534 of Scd5p fused to the GBD ( GBD - scd5 - (cid:1) 338 ) . scd5 - (cid:1) 338 Integration and END3 Gene Deletion To integrate the scd5 - (cid:1) 338 allele at the SCD5 chromosomal locus , pAC10 ( URA3 , scd5 - (cid:1) 338 ) was linearized by Blp I and transformed into scd5 (cid:1) : : TRP1 / SCD5 strains , selecting on C - URA . YIp5 - scd5 - (cid:1) 338 could integrate adjacent to SCD5 or scd5 (cid:1) : : TRP1 . Several integrants strains were plated on FOA to select for recombinants that lost the vector and adjacent sequence . FOA R colonies were then screened for the loss of TRP1 by plating replica plating on C - TRP . The Trp (cid:3) candidates represented events where integration occurred adjacent to the null allele and recombination excised scd5 (cid:1) : : TRP1 retaining the scd5 - (cid:1) 338 allele . The scd5 - (cid:1) 338 mutation generates a new Dde I site . The integration of scd5 - (cid:1) 338 was conﬁrmed by heteroduplex analysis ( Cotton , 1992 ) and PCR analysis combined with restriction enzyme digestion using Dde I . Tetrads were dissected to generate haploid progeny ( SL3519 , SL3521 , and SL4182 ) . The scd5 - (cid:1) 338 seg - regants were temperature sensitive for growth and expressed the truncated protein , as expected . To generate a null allele of END3 the complete ORF was replaced by HIS3 - MX6 using a PCR - based one - step gene - replacement method . The disruption PCR fragment was created with primers 5 (cid:4) - AGTTAGTGGGTATTGGAAAGGCCGGTAAAGATAACAGGG - ATCTCTGAAAACGGATCCCCGGGTTAATTAA - 3 (cid:4) and 5 (cid:4) - AA - CAAACAGTAAATATTACACATTCATGTACATAAAATTAATTATCGGTGGAATTCGAGCTCGTTTAAAC - 3 (cid:4) using pFA6a - HIS3MX6 ( Wach , 1996 ) as the template . This PCR product was transformed into a scd5 - (cid:1) 338 / SCD5 heterozygous diploid generat - ing SL4117 . Colony PCR was used to verify the disruption . Two - hybrid Interaction Analysis For the two - hybrid screen with CLC1 as a bait , a yeast genomic two - hybrid library ( James et al . , 1996 ) was transformed into SL3004 . YPJ96 - 4A ( James et al . , 1996 ) was transformed with pKH31 ( pGBD - CLC1 ) . The library strain and YPJ96 - 4A carrying pKH31 were mated in liquid culture for 4 h and plated on YEPD overnight . The cells were scraped from the plate and replated on synthetic medium lacking leucine , adenine , and uracil ( C - ADE - LEU - URA ) to select for mated zygotes and to monitor expression of the GAL2 - ADE2 re - porter from YPJ96 - 4A .

Molecular Biology of the Cell 2610 further screened for false positives by testing against an empty bait vector and nonrelevant baits . Plasmids that passed these tests were sequenced from both ends of the insert . Scd5p two - hybrid interactions studies used the mating method described above to generate strains expressing GAD and GBD plas - mids . For clathrin two - hybrid interaction studies , YPJ96 - 4A was directly transformed with both GAD and GBD plasmids . For anal - ysis of two - hybrid interactions , log phase cultures were diluted to 5 (cid:5) 10 6 cells / ml , and equal volumes of cells were spotted on C - ADE - LEU - URA and C - LEU - URA plates . The plates were grown for 3 – 5 d at 30°C . Other Assays The alpha - factor endocytosis assay was performed as described previously ( Dulic et al . , 1991 ) . Lucifer yellow ( LY ) uptake was carried out by methods described in Munn et al . ( 1995 ) . The latrun - culin - A ( Lat - A ) halo sensitivity assay was performed as described by Ayscough et al . ( 1997 ) , comparing a scd5 - (cid:1) 338 strain ( SL4301 ) to an isogenic wild - type control ( SL4302 ) . Microscopy Yeast cells were grown to early exponential phase in YEPD or YEP - GAL . For F - actin , DNA , and chitin staining , cells were ﬁxed with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde and then stained with Alexa - 568 - phalloi - din ( Molecular Probes , Eugene , OR ) , 4 (cid:4) 6 (cid:4) - diamidino - 2 - phenylindole ( DAPI ; Sigma , St . Louis , MO ) , or calcoﬂuor white ( Sigma ) , respec - tively , as described in Adams and Pringle ( 1991 ) and Pringle ( 1991 ) . For simultaneous localization of GFP - Scd5p and actin , cells were ﬁxed for 10 min with 2 . 0 % formaldehyde and washed three times with PBS . The cells were stained with Alexa - 594 - phalloidin ( Molec - ular Probes ) as described in Adams and Pringle ( 1991 ) and visual - ized immediately . For GFP - Abp1p and actin colocalization , cells were ﬁxed and processed as described in Heil - Chapdelaine et al . ( 1998 ) . For immunoﬂuorescence , cells were prepared using a methanol / acetone ﬁxation as described previously ( Pringle et al . , 1991 ) . Afﬁn - ity - puriﬁed rabbit anti – C - terminal Sla2p antiserum ( Yang et al . , 1999 ) was used at 1 : 75 dilution , and guinea pig anti - actin antiserum ( Mulholland et al . , 1994 ) was used at 1 : 2000 dilution . For ﬂuorescent visualization , FITC - conjugated goat anti - rabbit IgG and Alexa - 594 – conjugated goat anti - guinea pig IgG were used at 1 : 800 dilution . Most of the microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axioplan - 2 microscope ( Thornwood , NY ) equipped with Nomarski differential interference contrast ( DIC ) optics , a plan - Neoﬂuor 100 (cid:5) objective ( numerical aperture 1 . 3 ) , and a Hamamatsu C4742 – 95 cooled CCD camera ( Bridgewater , NJ ) using QED acquisition software . A LSM 410 confocal microscope equipped with a plan - Apochromat 100 (cid:5) objective ( numerical aperture 1 . 4 ) was used for analysis of cells stained with Alexa - 568 - phalloidin in Figures 2 and 6 . Images were manipulated in Adobe Photoshop ( San Jose , CA ) . For quantiﬁcation of microscopy , 100 – 500 cells were counted for each condition . Cells were scored as having depolarized actin patches if there were (cid:3) 10 patches in the mother cell of cells with buds . Actin patches were scored “large” ( or aggregates of actin ) if they were (cid:3) 0 . 5 (cid:2) m diameter . Normal patches seen in wild - type cells were typically 0 . 1 – 0 . 2 (cid:2) m diameter . Large patches were usually delocalized to the mother cell , but each was counted as a single patch . G - actin “bars” were scored by their unusual stick - like or bar morphology and were only detected with anti - actin antibodies . Actin bar structures were never observed in wild - type cells . RESULTS Endocytosis Is Defective in a scd5 Truncation Mutant SCD5 was originally isolated as a multicopy suppressor of the lethality of a clathrin HC - deﬁcient strain ( Nelson and Lemmon , 1993 ) . Previously we studied a temperature - sensitive scd5 - (cid:1) 338 mutant , expressing a 338 - amino acid COOH - terminal truncation of Scd5p ( Nelson et al . , 1996 ) . This strain exhibits a partial post - Golgi secretion defect at the nonpermissive temperature but no obvious defects in sorting / retention of trans - Golgi proteins typical of clath - Figure 1 . Endocytosis is defective in scd5 - (cid:1) 338 cells at 37°C . ( A ) Receptor - mediated internalization of radiolabeled (cid:1) - factor . Cultures were grown at 25°C to mid log phase in YEPD , pelleted , and resus - pended at 1 (cid:5) 10 9 cells / ml in fresh YEPD . Cells were preincubated at 25 ( F , f ) or 37°C ( E , (cid:1) ) for 15 min before addition of 35 S - radiolabeled (cid:1) - factor . Samples were harvested at times indicated and processed for determination of internalized (cid:1) - factor . Strains are isogenic wild - type ( SL3921 ; F , E ) and scd5 - (cid:1) 338 ( SL3993 ; f , (cid:1) ) . ( B ) Lucifer yellow ( LY ) uptake . Wild - type ( SL1462 ; a and c ) and scd5 - (cid:1) 338 ( SL3739 ; b and d ) cells were incubated at 25°C ( a and b ) or preshifted to 37°C ( c and d ) for 15 min . Then LY was added , and incubation was continued for 60 min . Cells were photographed using DIC ( to visualize the vacuole ) and ﬂuorescence microscopy . Bar , 5 (cid:2) m . Scd5p and Clathrin in Actin Function Vol . 13 , August 2002 2611 rin mutants ( Nelson et al . , 1996 ) . Because clathrin mutants also display slowed receptor - mediated endocytosis ( Payne et al . , 1988 ; Tan et al . , 1993 ; Huang et al . , 1997 ) , we examined whether Scd5p function is required for inter - nalization of (cid:1) - factor by its receptor , Ste2p ( Figure 1A ) . At 25°C , internalization of 35 S - labeled (cid:1) - factor was nearly normal compared with an isogenic wild - type strain . Pre - shifting scd5 - (cid:1) 338 cells to 37°C for 15 min resulted in a rapid and complete block in internalization of (cid:1) - factor . We also examined ﬂuid - phase endocytosis in the scd5 mutant by visualizing accumulation of the ﬂuorescent dye lucifer yellow ( LY ) in the vacuole ( Figure 1B ) . At 25°C to 35 – 55 % of scd5 - (cid:1) 338 cells , depending on the isolate , showed vacuolar staining with LY . When cells were shifted to 37°C , uptake to the vacuole was completely blocked . Nearly 100 % of wild - type cells internalized LY at either temperature . We conclude that Scd5p is required for both ﬂuid - phase and receptor - mediated endocytosis . Figure 2 . Actin organization is defective in scd5 - (cid:1) 338 cells . Wild - type ( SL1528 , A , B , E , and F ) and scd5 - (cid:1) 338 ( SL3920 , C , D , G , and H ) strains were grown on YEPD to log phase at 25°C . Cells were immediately harvested ( A , C , E , and G ) or shifted to 34°C ( B , D , F , and H ) for 3 h before ﬁxation , staining , and micro - scopic visualization as described in MATERI - ALS AND METHODS ( Bar , 5 (cid:2) m ) .

Molecular Biology of the Cell 2612 Scd5p Is Important for Actin Organization The endocytic defects of scd5 - (cid:1) 338 are much more severe than observed in clathrin mutants ( Payne et al . , 1988 ; Tan et al . , 1993 ; Huang et al . , 1997 ) but resemble the internalization phenotypes of a number of mutants with a perturbed corti - cal actin cytoskeleton ( e . g . , see Ku¨bler and Riezman , 1993 ; Be´ne´detti et al . , 1994 ; Munn et al . , 1995 ; Wesp et al . , 1997 ; Madania et al . , 1999 ; Schaerer - Brodbeck and Riezman , 2000 ) . Moreover , some of these mutants , e . g . , sla2 / end4 , rvs161 , rvs167 , and act1 , also display partial post - Golgi secretory defects similar to those of scd5 - (cid:1) 338 ( Novick and Botstein , 1985 ; Nelson et al . , 1996 ; Mulholland et al . , 1997 ; Breton et al . , 2001 ) . Therefore , we examined actin organization in the scd5 - (cid:1) 338 mutant . Two major actin ﬁlament - based ( F - actin ) structures are seen in yeast cells : actin cables and cortical actin patches ( Adams and Pringle , 1984 ; Pruyne and Bretscher , 2000a ) . The cables , which are bundles of actin ﬁlaments , are respon - sible for polarized growth and delivery of secretory vesicles , cell wall material , organelles , and other proteins into the growing daughter cell . Cortical actin patches appear at the site of bud emergence and then localize primarily to the growing bud . Late in the cell cycle , patches ﬁrst redistribute across mother and daughter cells . Finally , cables reorient toward the mother / daughter cell neck and patches concen - trate at the bud neck where they are involved in septum formation and cytokinesis ( See Figure 2 , A and B ) . To examine actin organization , wild - type and scd5 - (cid:1) 338 cells were grown at 25°C or shifted to 34°C for 3 h and stained with Alexa - 568 - phalloidin to label F - actin . Many scd5 - (cid:1) 338 mutant cells displayed aberrant patch organiza - tion , which was more severe at 34°C ( Figure 2 , C and D ) . Often these patches were depolarized to the mother cell , and some patches appeared larger than normal cortical actin structures ( see Figure 2I for quantiﬁcation of patch morphol - ogy ) . In addition , there were fewer or thinner cables in some scd5 - (cid:1) 338 cells , particularly in those that had larger patches , and in some cells the cables seemed to be misoriented . There is very little nonpolymerized globular actin ( G - actin ) and it is not aggregated in normal yeast cells ; how - ever , G - actin aggregates or actin bars are observed in the presence of some mutations affecting the actin cytoskeleton ( e . g . , srv2 (cid:1) , act1 - 2 , or sla1 (cid:1) ; Novick and Botstein , 1985 ; Holtzman et al . , 1993 ; Cope et al . , 1999 ) . Therefore we stained SCD5 and scd5 - (cid:1) 338 cells with anti - actin antibodies , which detect both F - and G - actin . The staining of wild - type cells resembled the phalloidin pattern ( Figure 2 , E and F ) . In contrast , many scd5 - (cid:1) 338 cells accumulated actin bars and other large aggregates of actin , presumably G - actin , that were not observed by phalloidin staining ( examples shown in Figure 2 , G and H , and quantiﬁcation in I ) . Latrunculin A ( Lat - A ) is an inhibitor of actin assembly , and many mutations affecting actin organization are hypersensitive to the drug ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ) . In addition , sla1 (cid:1) and end3 (cid:1) are slightly resistant to Lat - A ( Ayscough et al . , 1997 ) . We found that scd5 - (cid:1) 338 also confers mild resistance to this inhibitor . In a Lat - A halo assay the scd5 - (cid:1) 338 mutant ( SL4301 ) gave a di - ameter ratio of 0 . 8 (cid:6) 0 . 05 compared with an isogenic wild - type strain ( SL4302 ; average of three experiments ) , although the observed effect could actually be stronger because scd5 - (cid:1) 338 grows slightly slower than wild type . The scd5 - (cid:1) 338 mutant was examined for other phenotypes that are often associated with perturbation of the actin cy - toskeleton . Mutations affecting actin can cause defects in bud site pattern selection and depolarized chitin deposition ( Novick and Botstein , 1985 ; Yang et al . , 1997 ) . Also , multinu - cleated cells and aberrant morphologies , including mul - tibudded cells , are sometimes seen because of the polarity defects in actin mutants ( Novick and Botstein , 1985 ; Yang et al . , 1997 ) . To examine budding pattern , cells were stained with calcoﬂuor white , which labels chitin in bud scars left on mother cells after cytokinesis ( Pringle , 1991 ) . In the scd5 - (cid:1) 338 cells chitin was delocalized both at 25°C and after shift to 34°C for 3 h ( Figure 3 , B and C , and 3 , E and F ) . Also , the majority of scd5 - (cid:1) 338 diploids ( (cid:7) 75 % ) displayed random bud scar placement at 25 and 34°C , whereas (cid:7) 93 % of wild - type cells showed the normal bipolar budding pattern ( Fig - ure 3 , A – C ) . Haploid scd5 - (cid:1) 338 cells also showed random Figure 3 . scd5 - (cid:1) 338 cells exhibit cell polarity defects . Cells were grown in YEPD to log phase at 25°C or shifted to 34°C for 3 h before ﬁxation and visualization . Top panels : ( A – F ) calcoﬂuor white stain - ing of chitin ; ( G – I ) cells stained with DAPI to visualize DNA . Bottom panels : DIC images . Strains are as follows : wild - type diploid ( SL1528 ) at 34°C ( A and G ) ; scd5 - (cid:1) 338 diploid ( SL3920 ) at 25 ( B and H ) or 34°C ( C and I ) ; wild - type haploid ( SL1462 ) at 34°C ( D ) ; scd5 - (cid:1) 338 haploid ( SL3739 ) at 25 ( E ) or 34°C ( F ) . Bar , 5 (cid:2) m . Scd5p and Clathrin in Actin Function Vol . 13 , August 2002 2613 budding ( 72 % at 34°C ) , rather than the normal axial budding pattern ( Figure 3 , E – F ) . Haploid and diploid mutants were heterogeneous in size and shape but were generally larger and rounder than wild - type cells ( Figures 1 and 3 ) . Cell surface rims were observed in DIC proﬁles of scd5 - (cid:1) 338 mutant cells , indicating the mutation results in thickened cell walls ( Figure 3 ) . EM analysis also showed thickening of the mother cell wall , similar to other cortical actin mutants . In addition , mutant cells ( 17 and 33 % of diploids at 25 and 34°C , respectively ) were often multibudded , mostly appear - ing to have a small aborted bud on the mother cell ( see Figure 3I ) . Similar numbers were observed in haploids . The concentrated patches of F - actin sometimes found in mother cells ( for example , see Figure 2C ) were often positioned at these sites of aborted budding . A signiﬁcant number of scd5 - (cid:1) 338 cells were multinucleated ( up to 14 % at 34°C ) , compared with (cid:8) 1 % seen in wild - type cells ( Figure 3 , G and H ) . From these data we conclude that scd5 - (cid:1) 338 causes cell polarity defects typical of many mutations affecting the actin cytoskeleton . scd5 - (cid:1) 338 Exhibits Genetic Interactions with Mutations in Genes Encoding Other Proteins that Modulate the Actin Cytoskeleton and / or Endocytosis Many mutations affecting actin cytoskeletal organization and / or endocytosis cause synergistic phenotypes when combined , and many of the normal gene products are phys - ically associated or directly interact ( Botstein et al . , 1997 ; D’Hondt et al . , 2000 ) . Therefore , we examined genetic inter - Figure 4 . Scd5p localizes with cortical actin .

K . R . Henry et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 2614 actions between scd5 - (cid:1) 338 and mutations in genes impor - tant for these processes ( Table 3 ) . Haploids carrying muta - tions in genes to be tested were crossed to scd5 - (cid:1) 338 and subjected to segregation analysis . Then wild - type , single , and combination mutant progeny from tetrads were ana - lyzed for synthetic growth phenotypes . We found sla2 - 41 ( end4 - 1 ) , pan1 - 20 , and end3 (cid:1) were synthetically lethal with scd5 - (cid:1) 338 . abp1 (cid:1) , and rvs161 (cid:1) , and rvs167 (cid:1) showed strong negative synergistic growth defects with scd5 - (cid:1) 338 , as the double mutants were inviable at 30°C and often grew very slowly at 25°C , whereas the single mutants grew relatively well or like wild - type cells at these temperatures . A weaker negative genetic interaction was observed with sac6 (cid:1) , where the sac6 (cid:1) scd5 - (cid:1) 338 double mutant grew at 30°C but not at 32°C . These genetic interactions are likely to be speciﬁc because ent1 (cid:1) , ent2 (cid:1) , sla1 (cid:1) , srv2 (cid:1) , yap1801 (cid:1) , yap1802 (cid:1) , and yap1801 (cid:1) yap1802 (cid:1) had no effect when combined with scd5 - (cid:1) 338 . In these cases , growth of the multiple mutants was similar to that of the scd5 - (cid:1) 338 mutant alone . The double mutants were also analyzed for enhanced defects in actin cytoskeleton organization at 25°C , compared with the single mutants , by staining with Alexa - 568 - phalloi - din ( summarized in Table 3 ) . Generally the results paralleled the growth phenotypes . The mutations that exacerbated the growth of scd5 - (cid:1) 338 the most caused more severe actin defects . For example abp1 (cid:1) scd5 - (cid:1) 338 double mutants had fewer cables and fewer , but larger and depolarized , patches than scd5 - (cid:1) 338 alone , even although the actin cytoskeleton in abp1 (cid:1) single mutants was normal at 25°C ( Drubin et al . , 1990 ) . In addition , disruptions in RVS161 and RVS167 , which exhibit some defects in the actin cytoskeleton on their own ( Bauer et al . , 1993 ; Sivadon et al . , 1995 ) , resulted in the appearance of more and depolarized patches and fewer actin cables than the single mutants . sac6 (cid:1) , which also per - turbs actin ( Adams et al . , 1991 ) , resulted in the appearance of fewer cables and a few larger patches in combination with scd5 - (cid:1) 338 . This weaker synergistic effect on actin is consis - tent with the more limited effect of sac6 (cid:1) on growth of the scd5 mutant . The scd5 - (cid:1) 338 double mutants that contained sla1 (cid:1) , ent1 (cid:1) , ent2 (cid:1) , yap1801 (cid:1) , yap1802 (cid:1) , or srv2 (cid:1) did not show an exaggerated actin phenotype . Instead , these double mutants resembled the scd5 - (cid:1) 338 mutant , despite the fact that some of these mutations ( sla1 (cid:1) and srv2 (cid:1) ; Vojtek et al . , 1991 ; Holtzman et al . , 1993 ; Lila and Drubin , 1997 ) cause actin phenotypes on their own . The noninteracting muta - tions also did not exacerbate the LY internalization defect of scd5 - (cid:1) 338 at 25°C . We note that most of the mutations caus - ing enhanced growth and actin cytoskeleton phenotypes with scd5 - (cid:1) 338 also had major endocytic defects on their own , so the LY analysis was uninformative . Overall this analysis indicates that mutations in several genes affecting actin organization and endocytosis also genetically interact with scd5 - (cid:1) 338 , further supporting a role for Scd5p in actin function . Scd5p Colocalizes with Cortical Actin Because scd5 - (cid:1) 338 causes several phenotypes observed in other mutants with defects in cortical actin organization , we examined localization of Scd5p using a GFP - tagged protein in cells where this was the only source of the protein . The plasmid containing GFP - SCD5 ( pKRH21 ) complements scd5 (cid:1) completely . We found that GFP - Scd5p colocalized with cortical actin patches visualized with Alexa - 594 - phal - loidin . This was most easily observed in budding cells , where there was a striking polarized distribution of Scd5p to the bud ( Figure 4 ) . GFP - Scd5p could also be seen in mother cell actin patches . However , there was not complete overlap of Scd5p and cortical patches , as has been observed for other actin patch proteins like Sla2p ( Yang et al . , 1999 ) . Overall , the localization results further support a role for Scd5p in cor - tical actin function . Clathrin Deﬁciency Causes Defects in Cortical Actin Organization Because Scd5p is important for endocytosis and the gene was isolated by its ability to rescue inviable strains of clath - Figure 5 .

( B ) Cells were grown to log phase in selective medium ( C - URA ) . Radiolabeled (cid:1) - factor was prebound to cells at 4°C in YEPD . Cells were pelleted , and then endocytosis was initiated by resuspending in prewarmed YEPD at 30°C . Samples were taken at the indicated times and cells were processed to determine percentage of (cid:1) - factor internalized . Strains are chc1 (cid:1) scd1 - v ( SL3593 ) transformed with YEp24 ( E ) , YEp24 - SCD5 ( ‚ ) or YCp50 - CHC1 ( (cid:1) ) . Scd5p and Clathrin in Actin Function Vol . 13 , August 2002 2615 rin HC - ( Chc1p ) deﬁcient yeast ( Nelson and Lemmon , 1993 ; Nelson et al . , 1996 ) , we considered the possibility that this interaction is associated with endocytic defects seen in via - ble clathrin mutants . To investigate this , we transformed a viable clathrin HC null strain with YEp24 , YEp24 - SCD5 , or a CHC1 complementing plasmid ( YCp50 - CHC1 ) and tested for suppression of the chc1 (cid:1) growth and receptor - mediated en - docytosis defects . SCD5 overexpression suppressed the tem - perature sensitivity of the viable chc1 (cid:1) strain quite well at 34°C , although not at 37°C ( Figure 5A ) . However , the slowed (cid:1) - factor internalization seen in chc1 (cid:1) mutants was minimally affected by overexpression of SCD5 ( Figure 5B ) , even at 30°C , a permissive growth temperature . Because scd5 - (cid:1) 338 causes actin defects , we next examined whether clathrin deﬁciency affects actin organization . We made use of a strain expressing CHC1 under control of the repressible GAL1 promoter as its only source of clathrin HC . GAL1 : : CHC1 cells grown in galactose medium showed the normal pattern of actin localization by phalloidin staining ( Figure 6A ) . Shifting to glucose for 15 h , which completely depletes Chc1p ( Nelson and Lemmon , 1993 ) , caused accu - mulation of larger actin patches . These large patches were usually delocalized to the mother cell during bud growth and were observed in 70 % of the cells ( Figure 6 , B and I ) . The clathrin - depleted cells also displayed fewer actin patches at the mother - daughter neck during cytokinesis , when compared with cells expressing clathrin HC ( Figure 6B ) . Furthermore , 35 % of HC - depleted cells contained actin bars , whereas none of the cells grown on galactose contained G - actin bars ( Figure 6 , E , G , and I ) . Similar actin phenotypes were seen in chc1 (cid:1) and clathrin LC - deﬁcient ( clc1 (cid:1) ) strains . We next tested whether overexpression of SCD5 could sup - press the actin organization defect of Chc1p - depleted cells . On Figure 6 . Overexpression of SCD5 partially suppresses the actin organization defect of clathrin - deﬁcient yeast . A GAL1 : : CHC1 strain ( SL554 ) was transformed with YEp24 ( A , B , E , and G ) or YEp24 - SCD5 ( C , D , F , and H ) . Precultures were grown on selective C - URA (cid:2) 2 % galactose . Then cells were washed and resuspended in medium containing galactose ( A , C , E , and F ) or glucose to deplete clathrin HC ( B , D , G and H ) for 15 h at 30°C . Cells were then ﬁxed and stained with Alexa - 568 phalloidin ( A – D ) or anti - actin antibodies ( E – H ) . Bar , 5 (cid:2) m . ( I ) Graph showing the percent - age of cells from the above cultures with large patches or actin bars . K . R . Henry et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 2616 galactose medium GAL1 : CHC1 cells transformed with YEp - SCD5 had normal actin organization ( Figure 6 , C and F ) , al - though during cytokinesis more depolarized patches were ob - served in the mother and daughter cells ( see Figure 6C , 2nd row , 3rd cell ) . However , in total , (cid:8) 10 % of cells with YEp SCD5 had depolarized patches when grown on galactose , and no large patches or bars were observed ( Figure 6F ) . On glucose medium the number of Chc (cid:3) cells with large patches was signiﬁcantly reduced by overexpression of SCD5 ( Figure 6 , D and I ) . Thus , extra Scd5p prevented aggregation of cortical actin . However , these normal size patches were still delocal - ized in the majority ( 83 % ) of the clathrin - deﬁcient cells ( Figure 6D ) . The actin bar defect of the Chc (cid:3) cells was also partially suppressed by increased Scd5p ( Figure 6 , H and I ) . In addition , SCD5 overexpression partially suppressed the enlarged size and morphological defects observed in chc1 (cid:1) and clc1 (cid:1) mutants . Genetic Interactions of scd5 - (cid:1) 338 and chc1 Mutations Because clathrin - deﬁcient yeast have actin phenotypes and overexpression of SCD5 partially rescues this defect , we examined whether mutations in CHC1 and SCD5 cause syn - thetic phenotypes . We made use of a chc1 - ts mutant ( chc1 - 521 ) , which exhibits TGN sorting and endocytic defects at 37°C , but is normal at 25°C ( Seeger and Payne , 1992a , 1992b ; Tan et al . , 1993 ) . The chc1 - ts mutant was crossed to a scd5 - (cid:1) 338 strain , and haploid progeny from tetrad dissection were analyzed . We found that although both the chc1 - ts and scd5 - (cid:1) 338 spore progeny grew up to 32 or 34°C , the chc1 - ts scd5 - (cid:1) 338 double mutants grew very poorly at 25°C and were completely inviable at 30°C or higher ( Figure 7A ) . Also , ﬂuid - phase endocytosis of LY in the double mutant was almost completely blocked at 25°C ( only 7 % of cells had vacuolar staining ) , although 98 % of the chc1 - ts and 39 % of the scd5 - (cid:1) 338 single mutants internalized the dye at this temperature ( Figure 7B ) . Furthermore , although the chc1 - ts mutant showed no actin phenotype at 25°C , it exacerbated the scd5 - (cid:1) 338 cortical actin defect causing appearance of more and larger actin patches than were observed in the scd5 mutant alone ( Figure 7C ) . There were no large patches in the chc1 - ts mutant and (cid:8) 10 % of scd5 - (cid:1) 338 mutant had large patches , whereas 50 % of the double mutant cells contained large patches of F - actin . Clathrin and Scd5p Interact with Sla2p by Two - hybrid Analysis A yeast two - hybrid screen was carried out to identify clath - rin LC interacting proteins ( see MATERIALS AND METH - ODS ) . Thirteen positive clones were obtained . Two of the clones contained C - terminal fragments of Chc1p including the LC binding domain ( Liu et al . , 1995 ) , as would be ex - pected . The other 11 clones ( representing ﬁve distinct iso - lates ) contained various fragments of Sla2p coding se - quences . Figure 8A shows two - hybrid interaction results with two of the LC interacting Sla2p clones . The smallest Sla2p prey coded for amino acids 292 – 520 , which includes part of the predicted central coil - coiled domain as well as the glutamine - rich region , the leucine zipper , and a portion of the proline - rich region ( Figure 8B ; Wesp et al . , 1997 ; Yang et al . , 1999 ) . A slightly smaller fragment ( residues 292 – 501 ) also interacted with LC ( Figure 8A ) . Interestingly , similar regions in the related mammalian proteins , HIP1 and HIP1R , were recently shown to interact with clathrin ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2001 ; Metzler et al . , 2001 ; Mishra et al . , 2001 ; Waelter et al . , 2001 ) . Chc1p - 655 – 1653 , which binds LC , also interacted with Sla2p - 292 – 501 . However , this association was some - what weaker than the interaction of LC with HC or LC with the Sla2p coil domain , as the pGAD - CHC1 - 6 55 – 1653 / pGBD - SLA2 - 2 92 – 501 transformant grew consistently more slowly on the C - adenine reporter plates . This suggests that the interaction of HC with Sla2p might be through LC . In addi - tion , conﬁrming previous studies ( Wesp et al . , 1997 ; Yang et al . , 1999 ) , we found that the coil - coiled domain of Sla2p can interact with itself ( Figure 8A ) . Genetic interactions were also observed between clathrin mutations and sla2 , supporting the two - hybrid physical as - Figure 7 . Synthetic phenotypes are caused by combining scd5 - (cid:1) 338 and chc1 - 521 . ( A ) Growth of scd5 - (cid:1) 338 chc1 - 521 double mutant . SL4182 ( scd5 - (cid:1) 338 ) was crossed to SL2726 ( chc1 - 521 ) and subjected to tetrad analysis . Resulting spore clones were streaked onto YEPD plates and incubated fo r 3 d at 25 , 32 , and 37°C . An example of a tetratype tetrad is shown .

Scd5p and Clathrin in Actin Function Vol . 13 , August 2002 2617 sociation results . Crosses of chc1 mutants to sla2 mutants resulted in strong synergistic growth phenotypes in double mutant spore progeny ( Figure 9 ) . In fact , chc1 (cid:1) was synthet - ically lethal with sla2 (cid:1) ( Figure 9A ) . Similar results were observed when clc1 (cid:1) was combined with sla2 mutations . Overall these results suggest that clathrin and Sla2p function in related pathways . Because scd5 - (cid:1) 338 shows synthetic lethality with sla2 - 41 ( end4 - 1 ) ( Table 3 ) and strong genetic interactions with chc1 - 521 ( Figure 7 ) , we tested whether Scd5p interacts with clath - rin or Sla2p by two - hybrid analysis . When full - length Scd5p was fused with the GAL4 DNA binding domain ( GBD ) , the fusion protein activated reporter genes even in the absence of the GAL4 activation domain ( GAD ) preys . However , the GBD - Scd5 - (cid:1) 338 truncation only weakly autoactivated , al - lowing tests for interaction with Sla2p and clathrin preys . We found that Scd5 - (cid:1) 338p could not interact with full - length LC or Chc1p - 655 – 1653 ( Figure 8C ) . However , a two - hybrid interaction was observed with the longer Sla2p - 292 – 968 clone ( Figure 8C ) but not the Sla2p 292 – 520 fragment . Thus , the N - terminal region of Scd5p appears to associate with Sla2p , but this interaction depends on se - quences C - terminal to the minimal region that binds clathrin LC . Clathrin and Scd5p Are Required for Normal Sla2p Localization In wild - type cells , Sla2p partially colocalizes with cortical actin patches ( Yang et al . , 1999 ) . This is most easily observed in unbudded and small budded cells where actin is highly polarized . Interestingly , not all actin patches stain with anti - Sla2p nor does every Sla2p patch have associated actin ( Yang et al . , 1999 ; Figure 10 , A and B ) . Because Scd5p and Chc1p interact with Sla2p by two - hybrid analysis , we tested whether Sla2p localization is affected in scd5 - (cid:1) 338 or Figure 8 . Clathrin and Scd5p interact with Sla2p by two - hybrid analysis . ( A ) Yeast strain YPJ96 - 4 was transformed with GAL4 binding domain ( GBD ) bait plasmids pGBDU ( emp - ty ) , pKH19 ( GBD - CLC1 ) , or pKH47 ( GBD - SLA2 - 292 – 501 ) in combination with GAL4 ac - tivation domain ( GAD ) prey plasmids pGAD ( empty ) , pKH24 ( GAD - CHC1 - 655 – 1653 ) , pKH19 ( GAD - CLC1 ) , p31 - 10 ( GAD - SLA2 - 292 – 968 ) , or p31 - 2 ( GAD - SLA2 - 292 – 520 ) . Equal numbers of cells from transformants were spotted on complete synthetic medium lacking leucine and uracil ( C - LEU - URA ) and medium lacking adenine , leucine , and uracil ( C - ADE - LEU - URA ) and grown for 3 and 5 d . Interactions of baits and preys were scored for activation of the GAL2 : : ADE2 reporter by growth on C - ADE - LEU - URA . ( B ) Model of Sla2p .

Bait and prey plasmids were combined by the mating method . Cells were spotted on plates as described in A and grown for 3 d . K . R . Henry et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 2618 Chc1p - depleted cells . In scd5 - (cid:1) 338 cells grown at 25°C , Sla2p was partially delocalized to the cytoplasm , but there was still some residual cortical staining of Sla2p ( Figure 10 , C and D ) . This remaining cortical Sla2p was much less polar - ized than in wild - type cells , and less was found in actin patches ( Figure 10 , C , D , and M ) . After a 3 - h shift to 34°C , nearly all of the Sla2p was cytoplasmic , although faint cor - tical rim staining was observed in some scd5 - (cid:1) 338 cells ( Figure 10F ) . However , these small patches at the cell pe - riphery rarely colocalized with actin ( Figure 10M ) . When GAL1 : : CHC1 cells were depleted of clathrin by growth on glucose , Sla2p was completely cytoplasmic in most cells ( Figure 10 , H and M ) , whereas cells grown on galactose showed the normal Sla2p staining pattern . We also localized another cortical actin patch protein , Abp1p ( Drubin et al . , 1988 ) , which was tagged with GFP . Interestingly , in the majority of scd5 - (cid:1) 338 cells grown at either 25 or 34°C , as well as cells depleted of clathrin , GFP - Abp1p was still associated with actin patches ( Figure 10 , I – M ) . Similar results were obtained with Rvs167p . Thus , loss of Scd5p or clathrin function speciﬁcally affects Sla2p and does not cause a general effect on all cortical patch proteins . DISCUSSION Scd5p Plays a Role in Actin Organization and Endocytosis In this study we found that Scd5p is crucial for normal actin organization and endocytosis . Both ﬂuid - phase and recep - tor - mediated endocytosis were completely blocked in the scd5 - (cid:1) 338 mutant at the nonpermissive temperature , which is a phenotype caused by many mutations that affect the cortical actin cytoskeleton . In these cells cortical actin patches were often larger or depolarized to the mother cell , and a major accumulation of G - actin in bar structures was observed , suggesting a defect in actin assembly or destabi - lization of F - actin . Other phenotypes typical of mutants with actin defects were observed in scd5 - (cid:1) 338 ( Pruyne and Bretscher , 2000a , 2000b ) , including delocalized chitin depo - sition , bud site selection defects , thickened cell walls , and the presence of multibudded and multinucleated cells . Sup - porting the phenotypic analysis , Scd5p colocalized with ac - tin patches in the cell . In our previous work on SCD5 we showed that the scd5 - (cid:1) 338 mutation caused a partial post - Golgi secretory defect at the nonpermissive temperature ( Nelson et al . , 1996 ) . Based on the evidence presented here , this secretory defect could be due to the effect of loss of Scd5p function on the actin cytoskeleton and / or endocytosis . Several other actin patch mutants display similar partial secretory defects or accumu - lation of secretory vesicles , including act1 - 1 , myo3 (cid:1) myo5 (cid:1) , sla2 (cid:1) , rvs161 (cid:1) , and rvs167 (cid:1) ( Novick and Botstein , 1985 ; Goodson et al . , 1996 ; Mulholland et al . , 1997 ; Breton et al . , 2001 ) . Budding continues and secretory vesicles still polarize to growth sites in many of these patch mutants , including scd5 - (cid:1) 338 ( K . Henry , unpublished results ) . It has been sug - gested that a defect in endocytosis may affect recycling of components ( e . g . , v - SNAREs ) required for assembly of ma - ture fusion - competent secretory vesicles ( Pruyne and Bretscher , 2000a ) . However , we noted that the scd5 mutant had cables that were often misoriented within the cell , so the secretion phenotypes could be due to a partial effect on polarization of actin cables . This polarization defect might be caused indirectly by effects on cortical actin patches , which may contribute to anchoring of cables in the bud . Alternatively endocytic defects might affect localization of important membrane proteins that provide cues needed for cable polarization . A more complex function for Scd5p is suggested by the scd5 - (cid:1) 338 budding pattern defect . Unlike most cortical patch mutants , which show defects only in the diploid bipolar budding pattern ( Yang et al . , 1997 ; Pruyne and Bretscher , 2000a ) , scd5 - (cid:1) 338 was defective in both hap - loid and diploid speciﬁc budding . Also SCD5 is an essential gene , whereas many cortical actin patch components that affect endocytosis are not . This suggests that Scd5p could play a broader role in actin organization and cell polariza - tion or may function in other cellular processes unrelated to actin . scd5 - (cid:1) 338 Shows Genetic Interactions with Mutations in Genes Encoding Other Cortical Actin Patch Components We found that the scd5 - (cid:1) 338 mutation caused more severe growth and actin organization phenotypes when combined with a number of mutations in cortical actin patch compo - nents , supporting the idea that Scd5p is important for cor - tical actin function . Interestingly , scd5 - (cid:1) 338 was syntheti - cally lethal with pan1 - 20 and end3 (cid:1) but phenotypes were not exacerbated with sla1 (cid:1) , even although Pan1p , End3p , and Sla1p exist in a complex ( Tang et al . , 2000 ; Zeng et al . , 2001 ) . This difference could be explained by the fact that pan1 and end3 (cid:1) mutants have severe endocytic phenotypes ( Be´ne´detti et al . , 1994 ; Tang et al . , 1997 ; Duncan et al . , 2001 ) , whereas Figure 9 . Clathrin mutants display negative synergistic growth defects with sla2 . ( A ) sla2 (cid:1) and chc1 (cid:1) are synthetically lethal . SL4162 ( sla2 (cid:1) ) was crossed to SL13 ( chc1 (cid:1) scd1 - v YCp50 - CHC1 ) . The CHC1 plasmid was dropped , and the diploid was sporulated and dis - sected for tetrad analysis . An example of a tetratype tetrad is shown . ( B ) Tetrads were dissected from SL13 ( chc1 (cid:1) scd1 - v YCp50 - CHC1 ) X SL4049 ( sla2 - 41 ) that had lost YCp50 - CHC1 or SL2726 ( chc1 - 521 ) X SL4049 . Overnight cultures of spore segregants were diluted to 10 7 cells / ml , and serial fourfold dilutions were made in YEPD . Equal volumes of cells were spotted on YEPD and plates were grown for 2 d at the indicated temperatures . Scd5p and Clathrin in Actin Function Vol . 13 , August 2002 2619 sla1 (cid:1) is only modestly affected ( Ayscough et al . , 1999 ; K . Henry , unpublished results ) . Because interaction of End3p with Pan1p is not dependent on the presence of Sla1p ( Tang et al . , 2000 ) , perhaps Pan1p and End3p association are most critical for function of this complex . Also , END3 , but not SLA1 , overexpression rescues the temperature sensitivity of pan1 - 4 , and overexpression of SLA1 prevents END3 overex - pression from rescuing the pan1 mutant at 37°C ( Tang et al . , 2000 ) . Thus , Sla1p may act antagonistically to End3p , which could explain the difference in genetic interactions with scd5 - (cid:1) 338 . scd5 - (cid:1) 338 had a strong genetic interaction with abp1 (cid:1) and rvs167 (cid:1) , but not srv2 (cid:1) . Interestingly both Srv2p ( ad - enylyl cyclase – associated protein ) and Rvs167p interact with Abp1p ( Freeman et al . , 1996 ; Lila and Drubin , 1997 ; Drees et al . , 2001 ; Fazi et al . , 2001 ) . However , rvs167 (cid:1) , but not srv2 (cid:1) , shows a pattern of genetic interactions similar to abp1 (cid:1) when combined with other mutations in genes encoding actin cytoskeleton components ( Lila and Drubin , 1997 ) . Thus , the results with scd5 - (cid:1) 338 further support the idea that Abp1p and Rvs167p functions are closely related . Figure 10 . Sla2p is mislocalized in scd5 - (cid:1) 338 and clathrin - depleted cells . Wild - type ( SL1528 ; A and B ) and scd5 - (cid:1) 338 ( SL3920 ; C – F ) strains were grown on YEPD to log phase at 25°C ( C and D ) or shifted to 34°C ( A , B , E , F ) for 3 h . The GAL1 : : CHC1 strain ( SL554 ; G and H ) was grown to log phase in YEP - GAL and then shifted to YEPD for 15 h at 30°C to deplete clathrin HC . In I and J scd5 - (cid:1) 338 ( SL3920 ) (cid:2) pJC4 [ pGFP - ABP1 ] was grown in C - URA and shifted to 34°C for 3 h . In K and L the GAL1 : CHC1 strain ( SL554 ) (cid:2) pJC4 [ pGFP - ABP1 ] was grown in C - URA (cid:2) GAL and then shifted to glucose medium for 15 h to deplete clathrin HC . Cells were ﬁxed , stained with anti - actin ( A , C , E , and G ) and anti - Sla2p antibodies ( B , D , F , and H ) ; or in cells for GFP - Abp1p localization ( J and L ) actin was visualized with Alexa - 594 phalloidin ( I and K ) . ( M ) Quantiﬁcation of the percent of cells with Sla2p or Abp1p showing colocalization with actin patches . Note that the GAL1 (cid:1) CHC1 strain grown on galactose gave similar results as wild - type cells . Bar , 5 (cid:2) m . K . R . Henry et al . Molecular Biology of the Cell 2620 Sla2p Localization Is Dependent on Scd5p Scd5p is also physically associated with components of the cortical actin cytoskeleton . In addition to showing overlap - ping localization with cortical actin patches , Scd5p interacts with Sla2p by two - hybrid analysis . In preliminary studies , we ﬁnd that it also interacts with Rvs167p , but not Rvs161p , by two - hybrid screening ( J . Chang , unpublished results ) . Thus far we have not been able to demonstrate association of Sla2p and Scd5p by coprecipitation , but their interaction may be transient or only occur in the context of the plasma membrane or when assembled with cortical actin structures . However , based on the synthetic lethality caused by com - bining sla2 - 41 ( end4 - 1 ) with scd5 - (cid:1) 338 , we believe the phys - ical interactions detected by two - hybrid analysis are func - tionally important . As further support for this , we found that Sla2p dissociated from cortical structures and accumu - lated in the cytoplasm in scd5 - (cid:1) 338 cells . The delocalization of Sla2p seen in scd5 - (cid:1) 338 appears to be speciﬁc , because other actin patch - associated components , Abp1p and Rvs167p , localize in cortical sites relatively normally in these cells . Also , scd5 - (cid:1) 338 cells still have phalloidin - staining actin patch - like structures , indicating the effect of scd5 - (cid:1) 338 on Sla2p localization is not merely caused by actin depolymer - ization . It is interesting to note that although Scd5 - (cid:1) 338p associ - ates with Sla2p by two - hybrid interaction , the same trunca - tion mutation causes delocalization of Sla2p . Possibly the C - terminal region of Scd5p is important for its localization with cortical actin , and perturbation of Scd5p localization thereby affects Sla2p’s association with actin patches . Scd5p has also been shown to interact with Glc7p ( Tu et al . , 1996 ; Uetz et al . , 2000 ; Venturi et al . , 2000 ; JiSuk Chang , unpublished results ) , which is yeast PP1 , a broad speciﬁcity Ser / Thr phosphatase with many cellular functions ( Stark , 1996 ) . PP1’s activity is restricted toward physiological sub - strates in vivo by different regulatory or targeting subunits ( Stark , 1996 ) , so it is possible that Scd5p targets PP1 to dephosphorylate speciﬁc actin - associated components . It could play a major role in regulating assembly , disassembly , or speciﬁc organization of actin - associated factors needed for endocytosis . Supporting this idea , genetic interactions with scd5 - (cid:1) 338 were observed with mutations in a number of actin - associated proteins that are known to be phosphor - ylated . One of these proteins is Sla2p , which interacts with Ark1p , an actin regulating kinase ( ARK ; Cope et al . , 1999 ) . Pan1p and Sla1p are phosphorylated by Prk1p ( another ARK ) , as well as Ark1p ( Zeng and Cai , 1999 ; Zeng et al . , 2001 ) . Recent evidence indicates that Prk1p phosphorylation disrupts association of Pan1p with Sla1p and End3p ( Zeng et al . , 2001 ) . Also , in ark1 (cid:1) prk1 (cid:1) double mutants cortical F - actin patches , and many patch components , including Sla2p , are found in large aggregates ( Cope et al . , 1999 ) . Because we ﬁnd that Sla2p dissociates from the cortex in the scd5 - (cid:1) 338 mutant , dephosphorylation of Sla2p or other patch compo - nents may be important for assembly in actin patches , and Scd5p / PP1 may regulate this . Clathrin Is Important for Organization of Actin in Yeast In previous studies we identiﬁed SCD5 as a multicopy sup - pressor of clathrin - deﬁcient yeast , but scd5 - (cid:1) 338 cells do not show the Golgi retention defects that lead to CPY sorting and alpha factor processing phenotypes seen in clathrin mutants ( Nelson et al . , 1996 ) . Also , overexpression of SCD5 could not suppress these clathrin mutant phenotypes ( Nel - son and Lemmon , 1993 ) . Here we report our discovery that clathrin mutants , like scd5 - (cid:1) 338 cells , have major cortical actin defects and accumulate signiﬁcant nonﬁlamentous G - actin . SCD5 overexpression partially suppressed these actin defects , and combining scd5 - (cid:1) 338 with a chc1 - ts mutation exacerbated growth , actin and endocytic phenotypes . Fur - thermore , clathrin mutations genetically interact with sla2 mutations , and Sla2p association with the cortex is depen - dent on the presence of clathrin . Previous studies are also consistent with a connection between clathrin and actin in yeast . Clathrin - deﬁcient yeast become polyploid at high fre - quency , and aberrant nuclear divisions within the mother cell are observed ( Lemmon and Jones , 1987 ; Lemmon et al . , 1990 ) . Like scd5 - (cid:1) 338 and other actin patch mutants , clathrin mutants are enlarged and round in appearance , they have delocalized chitin deposition , and their cell walls are thick - ened ( Lemmon and Jones , 1987 ; Lemmon et al . , 1990 ; S . K . Lemmon , unpublished results ) . Moreover , clathrin interacts with other cortical patch components , such as Ent1 / 2p ( Wendland et al . , 1999 ) , in addition to Sla2p . Therefore , we suggest that clathrin plays a role in cortical actin function in yeast . Clathrin Interacts with Sla2p Clathrin is a trimeric molecule with three HC’s joined at the C terminus and a LC bound to each leg in the hub region adjacent to the triskelion vertex . Each HC contains an N - terminal globular terminal domain ( TD ) that interacts with a number of proteins containing a signature clathrin binding motif ( “clathrin box” ) related to LLDLD in amphiphysin ( Dell’Angelica , 2001 ) . This interaction is thought to facilitate the recruitment of clathrin and many of its associated factors to sites of clathrin - mediated transport . The yeast epsins ( Ent1 / 2p ) and AP180 - like proteins ( Yap1801p / Yap1802p ) both bind to the Chc1p TD via this type of clathrin binding motif ( Wendland and Emr , 1998 ; Wendland et al . , 1999 ) . Interestingly , we identiﬁed Sla2p in a two - hybrid screen with the clathrin LC . Although Sla2p has some sequences distantly related to the LLDLD motif , we found that the clathrin LC interacted with a portion of the Sla2p central coiled - coil domain , which does not contain potential clathrin TD - binding sequences . A fragment of clathrin HC including the LC binding region , but not the TD , also interacted with Sla2p , albeit more weakly than LC . In preliminary studies we ﬁnd that LC interacts with Sla2p by two - hybrid analysis in a chc1 (cid:1) strain , indicating that this association is not de - pendent on HC ( T . Newpher , unpublished results ) . We note that , because Sla2p dimerizes via the central coiled - coil do - main ( Wesp et al . , 1997 ; Yang et al . , 1999 ; this study ) , the two - hybrid coiled - coil product could associate with endog - enous Sla2p . Thus , we cannot yet exclude the possibility that the LC interacts with another portion of Sla2p or that clath - rin HC interacts with other Sla2p regions , possibly via the TD . However , consistent with an importance for the LC - Sla2p coiled - coil interaction , deletion of the Sla2p central coiled - coil domain causes defects in endocytosis and actin organization that resemble those of clathrin - deﬁcient cells ( Wesp et al . , 1997 ; Yang et al . , 1999 ) . Scd5p and Clathrin in Actin Function Vol . 13 , August 2002 2621 Recent work has shown that the mammalian Sla2p - related proteins , HIP1 and HIP1R , localize to sites of clathrin - medi - ated endocytosis in vivo , are enriched in clathrin - coated vesicles , and bind directly to clathrin ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 1999 , 2001 ; Metzler et al . , 2001 ; Mishra et al . , 2001 ; Waelter et al . , 2001 ) . Additional studies indicate that that HIP1R may link the actin cytoskeleton to coated pits and suggest that cortical actin helps organize or isolate regions of active clathrin - mediated internalization ( Gaidarov et al . , 1999 ; Ben - nett et al . , 2001 ; Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2001 ) . Thus , HIP1 ( R ) may be important for this organization of coated - pits or may be actively involved in the endocytic process itself . The binding of clathrin to HIP1 and HIP1R appear to be distinct . In HIP1 , there are clathrin N - TD - binding sequences as well as AP - 2 binding motifs ( DPF and FXDXF ) adjacent to the central coiled - coil region ( Metzler et al . , 2001 ; Mishra et al . , 2001 ; Waelter et al . , 2001 ) . In HIP1R the binding to clathrin appears to occur principally via the coil - coiled re - gion and involves a direct interaction with clathrin LC ( En - gqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2001 ; Legendre - Guillemin et al . , 2002 ) , similar to our ﬁndings of Sla2p and yeast LC binding . In addition , overexpression of a hub fragment of clathrin , which contains the LC binding site and inhibits clathrin - mediated endocytosis , causes dissociation of HIP1R from coated pits in HeLa cells ( Bennett et al . , 2001 ) . Similarly , we found that depletion of clathrin causes dissociation of Sla2p from the cell cortex . Overall this indicates there are close connections between clathrin , Sla2p - related proteins and the actin cytoskeleton in all eukaryotes . Why then might clathrin deﬁciency in yeast only cause a partial defect in endocytosis ? Clathrin may help collect spe - ciﬁc membrane proteins , localize regulatory factors and or mark / domains for endocytosis , but not be absolutely re - quired for generating force for internalization , which may be primarily an actin - mediated process in yeast . Clathrin may be diffusely distributed in the cortical actin network , which would explain why surface - coated pits have yet to be de - tected by microscopic methods . Possibly , classic surface - derived CCV do not even form in yeast , although some plasma membrane proteins have been detected in enriched CCV fractions ( Pishvaee et al . , 2000 ) . Still , it has not been ruled out that these vesicles are of endosomal origin or on a recycling trajectory ( Valdivia et al . , 2002 ) . Recent work also indicates that clathrin may be important for formation of a subclass of secretory vesicles , so CCV could contain newly synthesized plasma membrane proteins ( Gurunathan et al . , 2002 ; Harsay and Schekman , 2002 ) . Nonetheless , our ﬁnd - ings suggest that the endocytic phenotype of clathrin - deﬁ - cient cells may relate to a role for clathrin in actin - associated processes . This effect may only be partial because clathrin is one of several factors that facilitate organization or stabili - zation of the cortical actin network . Interestingly , many homologues of mammalian clathrin associated factors that are involved in endocytosis in yeast ( e . g . , Ent1 / 2p [ epsins ] , Pan1p [ Eps15 - related ] , and Rvs161 and Rvs167 [ am - phiphysins ] ) , are also important for actin organization ( Munn et al . , 1995 ; Sivadon et al . , 1995 ; Tang and Cai , 1996 ; Wendland et al . , 1996 ; Balguerie et al . , 1999 ; Wendland et al . , 1999 ) . A ﬁnal question concerns why SCD5 was isolated as a multicopy suppressor of clathrin - deﬁcient lethality . Muta - tions in both clathrin and SCD5 show genetic interactions with sla2 and both clathrin and Scd5p are required for localization of Sla2p at the cell cortex . Our data suggest that Scd5p , as a potential targeting subunit for PP1 , may promote the recruitment of proteins , like Sla2p , to the cortical actin network . Thus , overexpression of SCD5 could counter the destabilization of cortical actin components that might occur in the absence of clathrin . Further studies will be directed toward determining whether Scd5p plays a regulatory role in actin organization and endocytosis and determining what are its targets .
