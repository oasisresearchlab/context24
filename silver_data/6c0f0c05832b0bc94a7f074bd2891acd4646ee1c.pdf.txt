Unless otherwise noted , reactions were carried out under an atmosphere of nitrogen or argon in air - dried glassware with magnetic stirring . Air - and / or moisture - sensitive liquids were transferred via syringe . Organic solutions were concentrated by rotary evaporation at 25 - 60 °C at 15 - 30 torr . Analytical thin layer chromatography ( TLC ) was performed using plates cut from glass sheets ( silica gel 60 F - 254 from Silicycle ) . Visualization was achieved under a 254 or 365 nm UV light and by immersion in an ethanolic solution of cerium sulfate , followed by treatment with a heat gun .

A commercially available colorimetric assay ( Trevigen , Gaithersburg , MD ) was used to measure PARP activity in vitro in the presence of inhibitors . Olaparib and the Olaparib - derivatives ( compound 6 , 10 , and 14 ) ( concentration from 10 μM to 1 nM ) were incubated with 0 . 5 units PARP HSA for 10 minutes in histone - coated 96 well plates . All experiments were carried out in triplicate . Control samples did not contain inhibitor . All reaction mixtures were adjusted to a final volume of 50 uL and a maximum final concentration 0 . 4 % DMSO in assay buffer . The remainder of the assay was performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions . PARP activity was measured by absorbance at 450 nm in each well using a Safire 2 microplate reader ( Tecan Group , Mannedorf , Switzerland ) . IC 50 values were calculated using Prism software ( GraphPad , La Jolla , CA ) . Cell Lines The MDA - MB - 231 cell line was purchased from ATCC ( Manassas , VA , USA ) and the OVCA429 cell line was generously provided by Dr Michael Birrer ( Massachusetts General Hospital , Boston , MA , USA ) . These cell lines were grown in RPMI media supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 100 I . U . penicillin , 100 μg / ml streptomycin , and 2 mM L - glutamine . HT1080 cells from ATCC were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 100 I . U . penicillin , 100 µg / ml streptomycin , and 2 mM L - glutamine . GFP expressing cell lines GFP - H2B cells ( HT1080 cell line ) and GFP - PARP cells ( MDA - MB - 231 cell line ) were constructed according to the previously reported procedure 2 , 3 . GFP - Mito cells ( OVCA429 cell line ) Green Fluorescent Protein tagged to subunit VIII of cytochrome c oxidase ( Mito - GFP ) was utilized to identify mitochondria . Mito - GFP was generated by subcloning the mitochondrial targeting sequence and AcGFP1 from the pAcGFP1 - Mito Vector ( Clontech , Cat . # 632432 ) into the pLVX - mCherry - N1 Vector ( Clontech , Cat . # 632562 ) using BamHI and NotI restriction enzymes . Correct insertion of pAcGFP1 - Mito was confirmed by sequencing the insert in its entirety . Infectious lentiviral particles were produced in HEK - 293T cells . Briefly , 293T cells at low passage number were plated in 10 cm dishes and cultured overnight at 37°C in a humidified chamber with 5 % CO 2 in Dulbecco ' s Modified Eagle Medium ( DMEM ) supplemented with 10 % Tet - system approved fetal bovine serum ( FBS , Clontech ) , 100 I . U . penicillin , 100 μg / ml streptomycin , and 2 mM L - glutamine . Cells were then transfected with a packaging plasmid mix of pMDL gag / pol , pRSV Rev , and pCMV - VSVg , ( Addgene plasmids 12251 , 12253 , and 8454 , respectively ) and the pLVX - Mito - GFP target vector in a 1 : 1 ratio using the TransIT - LT1 Transfection Reagent ( Mirus ) . The 293T cells were then incubated for approximately 72 h , at which point the supernatant was collected and filtered through a 0 . 45 μm cellulose acetate syringe filter . Supernatants were aliquoted into cryovials and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen before being stored at - 80 °C . To generate OVCA429 cells stably expressing the Mito - GFP reporter , cells were plated in 12 well plates and infected with lentiviral supernatants such that approximately 85 % of cells were fluorescent . Cells were then sorted for positive fluorescence using a BD FACSAria ( MGH Pathology - Simches and CNY Flow Cytometry Core and Flow Image Analysis ) followed by selection in 5 μg / ml puromycin . Cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10 % FBS , 100 I . U . penicillin , 100 μg / ml streptomycin , 2 mM L - glutamine , and 3 μg / ml puromycin . Live cell fluorescence microscopic imaging of SiR - based CIDs . OVCA429 , HT1080 and MDA - MB - 231 cells were plated at 5000 cells per well in 96 - well black μ - clear bottom plates ( Grenier Bio - One ) and were grown for 48 - 72 hrs . On the day of imaging , cells were incubated with a final concentration of 10 μM ( 0 . 1 % DMSO in growth media ) of compound 6 , 10 and 14 for 30 min at 37°C . Cells were washed three times with media ( 3 min each ) and live cells were imaged in a humidified environmental chamber of a DeltaVision microscope using a 40X objective . Competition imaging experiment . OVCA429 ( GFP - Mito ) cells were plated at 5000 cells per well in 96 - well black μ - clear bottom plates ( Grenier Bio - One ) and were grown for 48 hrs . On the day of imaging , cells were incubated with final concentration of 800 and 400 nM ( 0 . 2 % DMSO in growth media ) of Olaparib ( AZD - 2281 ) for 30 min at 37°C . Without washing , cells were co - incubated with compound 14 ( 5 μM final concentration with 0 . 4 % DMSO in growth media ) and Olaparib ( 800 and 40 nM ) for 30 min at 37°C . Cells were washed three times with media ( 5 min each ) and live cells were imaged in a humidified environmental chamber of a DeltaVision microscope using a 20X objective .
