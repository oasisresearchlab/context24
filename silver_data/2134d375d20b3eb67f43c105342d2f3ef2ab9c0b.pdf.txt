Cell transformation by Rous sarcoma virus re - sults in a dramatic change of adhesion structures with the substratum . Adhesion plaques are replaced by dot - like at - tachment sites called podosomes . Podosomes are also found constitutively in motile nontransformed cells such as leukocytes , macrophages , and osteoclasts . They are rep - resented by columnar arrays of actin which are perpendic - ular to the substratum and contain tubular invaginations of the plasma membrane . Given the similarity of these tu - bules to those generated by dynamin around a variety of membrane templates , we investigated whether dynamin is present at podosomes . Immunoreactivities for dynamin 2 and for the dynamin 2 – binding protein endophilin 2 ( SH3P8 ) were detected at podosomes of transformed cells and osteoclasts . Furthermore , GFP wild - type dynamin 2aa was targeted to podosomes . As shown by ﬂuorescence re - covery after photobleaching , GFP - dynamin 2aa and GFP - actin had a very rapid and similar turnover at podosomes . Expression of the GFP - dynamin 2aa G273D abolished podo - somes while GFP - dynamin K44A was targeted to podo - somes but delayed actin turnover . These data demonstrate a functional link between a member of the dynamin fam - ily and actin at attachment sites between cells and the sub - stratum . Key words : clathrin • endocytosis • actin patches • Src • osteoclast Introduction Dynamin is a GTPase that plays a critical role in endocyto - sis . In mammals it occurs as three distinct isoforms ( dy - namin 1 , 2 , and 3 ) with different cellular and subcellular distributions ( Urrutia et al . , 1997 ; Schmid et al . , 1998 ) . Based on studies of the Drosophila melanogaster shibire mutant which harbors a temperature - sensitive mutation in the dynamin gene , dynamin was proposed to mediate the fission of endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane in nerve terminals ( Koenig and Ikeda , 1989 ; Chen et al . , 1991 ; van der Bliek and Meyerowitz , 1991 ) . Subsequent studies have generalized this putative function of dynamin to clathrin - mediated endocytosis in all cells ( Herskovits et al . , 1993 ; van der Bliek et al . , 1993 ) and more recently to other forms of endocytosis ( Schnitzer et al . , 1996 ; Henley et al . , 1998 ; Gold et al . , 1999 ) . Ultrastructural analysis of nerve terminals of shibire mutants after exposure to the re - strictive temperature ( Koenig and Ikeda , 1983 ) and of mem - brane templates incubated with brain cytosol , ATP and GTP g S ( Takei et al . , 1995 ) , have shown that dynamin can oligomerize into rings or stacks of rings at the neck of en - docytic vesicles , consistent with its putative role in the sepa - ration of endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane . Stacks of rings produce in peculiar elongations of the neck of endocytic pits into narrow tubules ( Takei et al . , 1995 ) . The precise mechanism of action of dynamin in the pinching - off reaction of endocytic vesicles remains unclear and several models have been proposed . While some mod - els suggest that dynamin acts as a mechanochemical en - zyme which severs the vesicle stalk ( Hinshaw and Schmid , 1995 ; Takei et al . , 1995 ; Sweitzer and Hinshaw , 1998 ) , other models propose that dynamin acts indirectly by recruiting or regulating downstream effectors ( De Camilli and Takei , 1996 ; Roos and Kelly , 1997 ) . The latter possibility has re - cently been supported by the report that GTP hydrolysis by dynamin may not be required for the endocytic reac - tion ( Sever et al . , 1999 ) . Although the majority of studies implicate dynamin in endocytosis , there is evidence to suggest that this GTPase may play additional functions in cell physiology . Dynamin alone , or dynamin in combination with amphiphysin , was shown to evaginate lipid membranes into tubules with a diameter very similar to that of collars of deeply invagi - nated clathrin - coated pits ( Sweitzer and Hinshaw , 1998 ; Takei et al . , 1998 , 1999 ) . This finding indicates that mem - brane tubulation by dynamin does not require a coated endocytic pit as a template , and hints to a possible role of dynamin in membrane dynamics independent of an en - Address correspondence to Pietro De Camilli , Department of Cell Biol - ogy , Yale University School of Medicine , 295 Congress Avenue , New Ha - ven , CT 06510 .

In growth cones , dynamin colocalizes with actin , and disruption of the function of either dy - namin or the dynamin - binding protein amphiphysin im - pairs growth cone dynamics ( Torre et al . , 1994 ; Mundigl et al . , 1998 ) . Dynamin also binds profilin II ( Witke et al . , 1998 ) , a major regulator of the actin based cytoskeleton , as well as syndapin / pacsin / FAP52 ( Merilainen et al . , 1997 ; Qualmann et al . , 1999 ; Ritter et al . , 1999 ) , a protein impli - cated in the attachment of the actin cytoskeleton to mem - branes . Many studies have implicated actin in endocytosis ( Munn et al . , 1995 ; Lamaze et al . , 1997 ; Wendland and Emr , 1998 ; Merrifield et al . , 1999 ) . Thus , one potential downstream effector of dynamin may be the actin cyto - skeleton and effects of dynamin on actin may underlie its role both in endocytosis and in other cellular functions . The proline - rich COOH terminus of dynamin was shown to interact with a variety of SH3 domain containing proteins including Src ( Gout et al . , 1993 ) a non - receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a key role in actin - mediated cell adhesion and motility ( Thomas and Brugge , 1997 ) . Previ - ous studies have shown that activated forms of Src induce a profound change in attachment structures between the cell and the substratum ( Tarone et al . , 1985 ) . Focal adhe - sions are replaced by dot - like contacts sites , called podo - somes ( Tarone et al . , 1985 ; Marchisio et al . , 1988 ; Nitsch et al . , 1989 ) which are columnar arrays of actin cytoskele - ton often containing a narrow tubular invagination of the plasmalemma roughly perpendicular to the substratum . In some cells , podosomes cluster in a peculiar rosette - like ar - rangement ( Nitsch et al . , 1989 ) . Podosomes are constitu - tively found in osteoclasts ( Zambonin - Zallone et al . , 1988 ) where Src plays an essential role ( Soriano et al . , 1991 ; Tanaka et al . , 1996 ) . In these cells podosomes are ar - ranged in a ring at the cell periphery where they mediate the attachment and motility of the osteoclast on bone and generate the sealed compartment where bone resorption takes place ( Zambonin - Zallone et al . , 1988 ; Tanaka et al . , 1996 ) . Furthermore , podosomes are present in leukocytes and macrophages where they play a role in migration and diapedesis ( Wolosewick , 1984 ; DeFife et al . , 1999 ; Linder et al . , 1999 ) . The membrane tubules which represent the core of podosomes are very similar in diameter to tubules generated by the oligomerization of dynamin around membrane templates ( Takei et al . , 1995 , 1998 ; Sweitzer and Hinshaw , 1998 ) . Prompted by this similarity , and by the potential connection of dynamin both to actin function and to Src , we investigated whether dynamin is concen - trated at podosomes . Materials and Methods Antibodies and Reagents Monoclonal antibodies directed against dynamin ( Hudy - 1 and D25520 ) , vinculin and actin were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology , Trans - duction Laboratories , Boehringer , and ICN Biomedicals , respectively . Rabbit polyclonal antibodies specifically directed against endophilin 2 were raised using a peptide corresponding to sequence unique to rat endophilin 2 ( SH3P8 ) within the region of the protein which differs among endophilin 1 , 2 and 3 , also called SH3P4 , SH3P8 , and SH3P13 ( Ringstad et al . , 1997 ) . Rabbit pan - endophilin antibodies ( serum 2 of Ringstad et al . , 1997 ) , rab - bit anti - dynamin - 2 polyclonal antibodies ( Dyn2 ; Cao et al . , 1998 ) and a monoclonal anti - Src antibody ( # 327 ; Horne et al . , 1992 ) were previously described . Monoclonal antibodies directed against clathrin’s heavy chain ( X - 22 ) and cortactin were kind gifts of Dr . Francis Brodsky ( University of California ) and Dr . J . Thomas Parsons ( University of Virginia ) , respec - tively . Rhodamine and fluorescein - labeled phalloidin was purchased from Molecular Probes . Secondary antibodies conjugated with CY3 and Ore - gon Green were purchased from Jackson Immunochemicals and Molecu - lar Probes , respectively . Cyclosporin A was purchased from Calbiochem - Novabiochem . Cell Culture and Immunocytochemistry BHK21 and RSV - transformed BHK21 cells were cultured at 37 8 C in GMEM , 10 % ( vol / vol ) Tryptose Phosphate Broth , 10 % ( vol / vol ) FBS , and 100 U / ml each of penicillin and streptomycin . Before fixation , RSV - transformed BHK21 cells were grown in 2 % FBS for 12 h and then for ad - ditional two hours in 0 . 2 % FBS . BHK21 cells were transfected using Lipo - fectAMINE Plus ( GIBCO BRL ) reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol . Cells were fixed in 4 % formaldehyde ( freshly prepared from para - formaldehyde ) in 0 . 1 M phosphate buffer , detergent - permeabilized , im - munostained and prepared for microscopic observation as previously described ( Cameron et al . , 1991 ) . Cells were visualized using a Zeiss Axio - phot 2 . cDNAs In this manuscript the term dynamin 2aa ( rat ) applies to the Genebank se - quence # B53165 . This sequence was previously referred to as either dy - namin 2aa ( Cao et al . , 1998 ) or dynamin 2ba ( Sontag et al . , 1994 ) by differ - ent groups . Constructs encoding GFP - dynamin 2aa ( COOH - terminal – linked GFP ) were previously described ( Cao et al . , 1998 ) . GFP - dynamin 2aa G273D and GFP - dynamin 2aa K44A were generated by a modified Strat - agene “QuickChange” site - directed mutagenesis technique following manufacturer’s instructions . The Pfu DNA polymerase was replaced by Pwo DNA polymerase ( Roche ) for initial amplification reaction . Muta - tions were verified by sequencing . A construct encoding GFP - actin ( NH 2 - terminal GFP linked by 5 glycines to chicken b - actin in a CMV driven vec - tor ) was a kind gift of Dr . Michael Way ( EMBL , Heidelberg ) . Electron Microscopy RSV - transformed BHK21 cells and osteoclasts were washed with phos - phate buffered saline ( PBS ) at 37 8 C , then fixed in 1 . 5 % glutaraldehyde in 0 . 1 M Na - Cacodylate , and postfixed with 1 % OsO 4 and 1 . 5 % K 3 FeCN 6 in 0 . 1 M Na - Cacodylate . En bloc staining with 0 . 4 % uranyl acetate ( Mg ) was performed before Epon embedding by standard procedures . Cell - free in - cubations of brain membranes with brain cytosol , ATP and GTP g S and immunolabeling of these preparations for dynamin and actin were per - formed as described ( Takei et al . , 1995 ) . Immunoprecipitation and Affinity Chromatography RSV - transformed BHK21 cells were washed with 120 mM phosphate buffer pH 7 . 4 , and removed with a cell scraper ( Becton Dickinson ) in the presence of 10 mM Hepes , 150 mM NaCl , and 1 % Triton X - 100 . The ex - tract was then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 14 , 000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge . 200 m g of extract was incubated with 2 m g of affinity - purified antibodies for 1 h at 4 8 C . Immune complexes were precipitated with 50 ml of protein A – Sepharose , extensively washed with 10 mM Hepes / 150 mM NaCl , and eluted in 200 m l of SDS / PAGE sample buffer . Conditions for affinity - chromatography on the GST fusion protein of the SH3 domain of endophilin 2 were previously described ( Ringstad et al . , 1997 ) . Isolation and Preparation of Osteoclasts Mouse osteoclasts were isolated according to procedures previously de - scribed ( Chambers and Magnus , 1982 ; Ali et al . , 1984 ) . In brief , long bones from 14 – 21 - d - old mice were dissected free of adherent tissue and placed in a - MEM containing 10 % FBS . They were minced into small pieces and pipetted vigorously to release osteoclasts . Bone particles were then allowed to sediment for 30 s and the remaining suspension containing osteoclasts was seeded onto serum coated coverslips . Coverslips were in - cubated 18 – 24 h at 37 8 C to allow cell attachment . Cells on coverslips were then fixed with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room tempera - ture , washed in PBS and processed for double immunofluorescence as de - Ochoa et al . Dynamin at Podosomes 379 scribed above for BHK21 cells . In some experiments cells were treated with cyclosporin A ( 20 m M ) for 20 min before fixation . Microinjection of Osteoclasts cDNA constructs were microinjected using an Eppendorf 5246 microin - jector with Femtotip needles . During injection osteoclasts were main - tained in a - MEM , 10 % FBS and 1 mM Hepes . After injection they were returned to the a - MEM media lacking Hepes and left to grow at 37 8 C for 6 h before fixation and immunostaining . Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) 1 experiments were conducted on a BioRad MRC 1024 two photon scanning laser microscope equipped with a krypton / argon laser and a sapphire Ti laser . The krypton / argon laser was used to excite the GFP - tagged proteins at 488 nm and emissions above 515 nm were collected . In each experiment , at least 20 consecutive baseline images were obtained . Then a region in the podo - some rosette was selected and photobleached using the sapphire Ti laser at 920 nm for 20 s at 50 % power . After photobleaching , fluorescence of the entire field was collected by the krypton / argon laser at 3 % power ev - ery second for at least 1 min after bleaching . The fluorescence intensity in the photobleached region of the podosome rosette at various times of recovery was normalized to the fluorescence intensity measured in a non - bleached region of the same rosette at the same post - bleaching time . This procedure allowed to account for the decreased fluorescence due to overall bleaching of the entire field . The fluorescence recovery curve was F ( t ) 5 F ss ( 1 2 e 2 kt ) 1 F 0 where F ( t ) is the fluorescence in the bleached area at time t , F ss is the net amount of fluorescence recovered at steady state , F 0 is the fluorescence in the bleached area immediately after photobleaching , and k is the constant that describes the rate of fluorescence recovery . Statisti - cal analysis was performed with all values given as a means of at least 6 sets of measurements 6 SEM . A t test was performed to compare the rate constants of the various curves and a P value of , 0 . 05 was taken as signif - icant . Nonlinear regression and t tests were performed using Microsoft Excel 4 . 0 . Results Presence of Dynamin 2aa at Podosomes of Rous Sarcoma Virus - transformed BHK21 Cells Rous sarcoma virus ( RSV ) - transformed BHK21 cells were stained with a variety of antibodies which recognize one or more of the three main dynamin isoforms , dynamin 1 , 2 , and 3 . In these BHK21 cells , podosomes cluster in a typi - cal rosette - like arrangement which can be visualized at the light microscopic level by staining for filamentous actin ( Fig . 1 , B and D ) and for other podosome markers such as vinculin and talin ( Fig . 1 A and data not shown ; Marchisio et al . , 1988 ) . Electron micrographs of the rosette in sec - tions cut perpendicular and parallel to the substratum demonstrate the characteristic juxtaposition of individual podosomes , i . e . , of columns of actin cytoskeleton sur - rounding a central membrane tubule ( Fig . 2 A – D ; Nitsch et al . , 1989 ) .

The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 150 , 2000 380 stratum , these tubules are continuous with the cell surface ( Fig . 2 , B – D ) . Their diameter ( z 25 nm ) is the same as that of dynamin coated tubules observed in synaptic mem - branes ( Takei et al . , 1995 ) . Of the several anti - dynamin antibodies tested , the Dyn2 antibody , which was raised against the proline - rich region of human dynamin 2aa ( data are available from GenBank / EMBL / DDBJ under accession number B53165 ; Jones et al . , 1998 ) , labeled very intensely podosome rosettes , as revealed by double stain - ing for filamentous actin with phalloidin ( Fig . 1 , C and D ) . In homogenates of BHK21 cells this antibody specifically recognized a band with the expected mobility of dynamin 2 ( Fig . 3 A ) . In addition , the Dyn2 antibody specifically depleted BHK21 cell extracts of dynamin 2 immunoreac - tivity recognized by another anti - dynamin antibody which recognizes dynamin 2 ( D25520 ) ( Fig . 3 B ) . Colocalization of the Dyn2 immunoreactive materials with actin did not occur throughout the cell . The few stress fibers present in these transformed cells were not stained ( data not shown ) , demonstrating a selective association of dynamin with the podosome pool of actin . Podosomes were not labeled by antibodies directed against either clathrin ( Fig . 1 , E and F ) or the endocytic clathrin adaptor AP - 2 ( Fig . 1 , G and H ) , thus indicating that podosomes are not a preferential site for clathrin - mediated endocytosis . Similarly , internalized transferrin , which is taken up by receptor - mediated endocytosis , did not show any preferential association with podosome ro - Figure 2 .

Dynamin immunoreactivity rec - ognized by Hudy - 1 antibodies , previously shown to recog - nize dynamin at clathrin coated pits ( Damke et al . , 1994 ) , was also not localized at podosomes ( Fig . 1 , I and J ) . Podosomes Are Positive for a Dynamin - binding Protein Podosomes , however , were intensely and specifically labeled with antibodies directed against endophilin 2 ( SH3P8 ; Fig . 1 , K and L ) a member of a family of three highly homolo - gous proteins ( endophilin 1 , 2 , and 3 , also referred to as SH3P4 , SH3P8 , and SH3P13 ) that interact with dynamin via a COOH - terminal SH3 domain ( Sparks et al . , 1996 ; Ringstad et al . , 1997 , 1999 ; Schmidt et al . , 1999 ) . This im - munofluorescence pattern was blocked by the presence in the immunostaining solution of the endophilin 2 peptide used as the immunogen for the generation of the antibod - ies ( data not shown ) . Furthermore , presence of authentic endophilin 2 immunoreactivity in RSV - transformed BHK21 cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis ( Fig . 3 C ) . The anti - endophilin 2 antibody recognized a 45 - kD band with the expected mobility of endophilin 2 ( Fig . 3 C , lanes 1 and 2 ) and this band comigrated with a band recognized by an antibody directed against all members of the endo - philin family ( Fig . 3 C , lane 3 ) . Endophilin 1 , 2 , and 3 have a pattern of expression which closely mimics that of dy - namin 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively ( Ringstad et al . , 1997 ) , and recent studies have suggested a functional partnership be - tween dynamin 1 and endophilin 1 ( SH3P4 ; Ringstad et al . , 1999 ; Schmidt et al . , 1999 ) . An interaction between dy - namin 2 and the SH3 domain of endophilin 2 was demon - strated by the property of a GST fusion protein of this do - main to affinity - purify dynamin 2 immunoreactivity from BHK21 cell extracts ( Fig . 3 D ) . Thus , the presence of en - dophilin 2 at podosomes supports a physiological role for dynamin 2 at these attachment sites . Podosome rosettes are also immunoreactive for Src ( Fig . 1 , M and N ; Gavazzi et al . , 1989 ; Nermut et al . , 1991 ) , which bind and phos - phorylate dynamin ( Gout et al . , 1993 ; Foster - Barber and Bishop , 1998 ; Ahn et al . , 1999 ) and for cortactin ( Fig . 1 , O and P ) another SH3 domain containing protein ( Wu and Parsons , 1993 ) which binds dynamin in vitro ( McNiven , M . , unpublished observation ) . The rosette - like distribution of dynamin 2 immunoreac - tivity and of other podosome markers was not observed in non – RSV - transformed BHK21 cells ( Fig . 4 , A – D ) , al - though even in these cells a fraction of Dyn2 immunoreac - tivity was colocalized with peripheral actin ( Fig . 4 , C and D ) . Finally , the localization of Dyn2 immunoreactivity at podosomes was not unique to RSV - transformed BHK21 cells but was also observed in v - Src – transformed Balb 3T3 cells , where podosomes remain isolated and scattered throughout the cell ( data not shown ) . GFP - dynamin 2aa Is Targeted to Podosomes Since some antibodies reported to react with dynamin 2 did not label podosomes ( not shown ) , we next searched for more direct evidence demonstrating the property of a dy - namin 2 isoform to concentrate at podosomes . RSV - trans - formed BHK21 cells were transiently transfected with a construct encoding rat GFP - dynamin 2aa ( dynamin 2aa ; data are available from GenBank / EMBL / DDBJ under ac - cession number B53165 ) . GFP - tagged dynamin 2aa accu - mulated at podosomes , as shown by the analysis of living cells ( Fig . 5 A ) , or of fixed cells counterstained for actin by phalloidin ( Fig . 5 , B and C ) . Individual podosomes were clearly resolved by high power observation of these cells ( Fig . 5 A ) . The lack of reactivity with podosomes of some antibodies which recognize dynamin 2 reflects a selective immunoreactivity of podosomal dynamin . This result may have several explanations including one or more of the fol - lowing possibilities : alternative splicing , epitope masking , Figure 3 . The Dyn2 antibody recognizes selectively dynamin in RSV - transformed BHK21 cell extracts and dynamin 2 specifi - cally interacts with endophilin 2 . ( A ) Western blot of a detergent extract of RSV - transformed BHK21 cells with the Dyn2 anti - body . ( B ) Triton X - 100 extracts of RSV - transformed BHK21 cells were immunoprecipitated with Dyn2 antibodies or control IgGs and the immunoprecipitates were reacted by Western blot - ting with either the Dyn2 antibody ( top ) or a commercial anti - dynamin antibody ( # D25520 from Transduction Laboratories ) which recognizes both dynamin 1 and 2 . Note that the Dyn2 anti - body depletes dynamin immunoreactivity ( arrows ) from the ex - tract . The slower mobility of dynamin 2 in the bound material was consistently observed and may reflect the absence of Triton X - 100 in the load . ( C ) Extracts of RSV - transformed BHK21 cells extracts were reacted by Western blotting with an endophilin 2 - specific antibody in the presence or absence of the peptide used as the immunogen ( lanes 1 and 2 ) or with a pan - endophilin anti - body ( lane 3 ) . ( D ) A Triton X - 100 extract of RSV - transformed BHK21 cells was incubated with either a GST fusion protein of the SH3 domain of endophilin 2 ( lane 1 ) or GST alone ( lane 2 ) . The bound material was then reacted by Western blotting with the Dyn2 antibody .

Dynamin 2 Is Also Present at Podosomes of Osteoclasts To insure that this localization of dynamin was not a con - sequence of cell transformation or specific of v - Src ex - pressing cells , we then examined a nontransformed cell known to contain podosomes . In osteoclasts , a peripheral actin - rich ring comprising podosomes , which may be seen as an exaggeration of the podosome rosette present in RSV - transformed BHK21 cells , forms the tight seal with the bone which delimits the compartment of bone resorp - tion ( Zambonin - Zallone et al . , 1988 ; Tanaka et al . , 1996 ) . A similar podosome - enriched actin ring is formed by os - teoclasts when they are cultured in vitro on serum - coated coverslips . Presence of narrow tubular invaginations within these podosomes was confirmed by electron microscopy ( Fig . 2 E ) . When mice osteoclasts cultured on coverslips were immunostained for dynamin 2 and endophilin 2 , in - tense immunoreactivity for both proteins was observed in the peripheral actin - rich ring ( Fig . 6 , A – D ) . In addition , after microinjection of DNA encoding GFP - dynamin 2aa , the expressed GFP fusion protein localized predominantly at podosomes ( Fig . 6 , E and F ) . Treatment of osteoclasts with cytochalasin B disrupted the peripheral actin ring re - sulting in a major change in cell morphology and a con - comitant redistribution of dynamin 2 immunoreactivity ( data not shown ) . Disruption of Podosomes by Cyclosporin A Studies in the nervous system have demonstrated that dynamin 1 is a substrate for the enzymatic activity of the calcium - dependent phosphatase calcineurin ( Liu et al . , 1994 ; Bauerfeind et al . , 1997 ) . Furthermore Dynamin 1 was shown to bind directly to calcineurin ( Lai et al . , 1999 ) . Dy - namin 1 undergoes constitutive phosphorylation in the nerve terminal and its Ca 2 1 - triggered calcineurin - dependent de - phosphorylation is thought to be required for the en - docytic reaction ( Liu et al . , 1994 ) . Dephosphorylation enhances the interaction of dynamin with its binding partners ( Slepnev et al . , 1998 ) and decreases its GTPase activity ( Liu et al . , 1994 ) , thus prolonging the half - life of GTP - dynamin . Accordingly , calcineurin inhibitors such as cyclosporin A and FK506 were reported to inhibit synaptic vesicle recycling ( Marks and McMahon , 1998 ) . Interestingly , cyclosporin A was also shown to inhibit os - teoclast differentiation and bone resorption in culture ( Chowdhury et al . , 1991 ; Orcel et al . , 1991 ; Klein et al . , 1997 ) . Based on our findings implicating dynamin in podo - some function , we tested whether inhibitors of calcineurin disrupts podosomes . Treatment of mouse osteoclasts for 20 min with cyclosporin A resulted in a disruption of their morphology ( Fig . 7 ) . Cyclosporin A – treated osteoclasts resembled osteoclasts from Src 1 / 1 mice that lack a periph - eral ring of podosomes and have decreased motility ( Neff et al . , 1997 ) . A similar disruption of podosomes was pro - duced by cyclosporin A in Src - transformed fibroblasts ( not shown ) . These results may underlie the reported in - hibitory effect of calcineurin antagonists on bone resorp - Figure 4 . Colocalization of dynamin 2 immunoreactivity and actin in RSV - transformed and nontransformed BHK21 cells .

Disruption of Podosomes by a Temperature - sensitive GFP - Dynamin 2aa Mutant Studies of dynamin 1 have defined mutations that impair its function and that have a dominant negative effect on endocytosis ( Herskovits et al . , 1993 ; van der Bliek et al . , 1993 ; Damke et al . , 1994 , 1995 ) . A Gly to Asp mutation at position 266 of Drosophila dynamin is responsible for the temperature - sensitive phenotype of the shibire mutant . A dynamin 1 mutant harboring the analogous mutation was shown to be functional at 30 8 C but to have a dominant negative effect at 38 8 C ( Damke et al . , 1995 ) . A corre - sponding mutation was introduced in GFP - tagged dy - Figure 6 . Immunolocalization of dynamin 2 and endophilin 2 in the podosomes of osteo - clasts . ( A – D ) Mouse osteo - clasts were immunostained for dynamin 2 and counter - stained for actin with phalloi - din . All three proteins colo - calize in the peripheral sealing zone known to be enriched in podosomes . ( E and F ) The cDNA encoding GFP - dynamin 2aa was microin - jected in the nuclei of the osteoclast . After 6 h , cells were fixed and counterstained for actin with phalloidin . Bar , 42 m M . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 150 , 2000 384 namin 2aa ( Gly to Asp mutation at position 273 ) and its effect was tested by transient expression in RSV - trans - formed BHK21 cells or in v - Src – transformed Balb / c 3T3 cells . At 30 8 C this mutant localized at podosomes but did not affect their structure ( Fig . 8 , C and D ) . In contrast , po - dosomes were only seldomly observed in transfected cells maintained at 38 8 C for 12 h after transfection ( Fig . 8 , A and B ) . Neighboring untransfected cells had normal podo - somes indicating that mutant dynamin , and not the tem - perature shift was responsible for podosome disappear - ance . A morphometric analysis revealed that 98 of 100 transfected Balb 3T3 cells had podosomes at the 30 8 C , but 7 of 100 cells had podosomes at 38 8 C . In the few cells containing podosomes at this temperature , GFP - dynamin 2aa G273D was still localized at podosomes . We also tested whether another well characterized dom - inant negative mutation of dynamin 1 , the K44A mutation ( Herskovits et al . , 1993 ; Damke et al . , 1994 ) , had a similar effect on podosomes if introduced into dynamin 2aa . Based on studies of the Ras GTPase , this mutation inhibits GTP binding and hydrolysis . GFP - dynamin 2aa K44A was targeted to podosomes but did not disrupt their structure ( Fig . 8 , E and F ) . Therefore , we explored the possibility that the K44A mutation may affect functional properties of dynamin 2aa at podosomes not resulting in an obvious modification of their structure . We used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ; Denk et al . , 1990 ; Yuste and Denk , 1995 ; Xu et al . , 1996 ) to determine the turnover of GFP - actin at po - dosomes , which are thought to be highly dynamic struc - tures relative to focal adhesion plaques . RSV - transformed BHK21 cells were transfected with GFP - actin and exam - ined by time - lapse two - photon excitation microscopy . Af - ter photobleaching , fluorescence nearly recovered within 60 s ( Fig . 9 , A and B ) . Jaspakinolide , a potent membrane permeant stabilizer of actin filaments ( Bubb et al . , 1994 ) , completely abolished the recovery of fluorescence indi - cating that such recovery is a result of actin dynamics ( Fig . 9 C ) . The FRAP of wild - type GFP - dynamin 2aa had a time course similar to that of actin ( Fig . 9 D ) and also did not recover in the presence of jasplakinolide ( not shown ) . The rate constants of the recoveries of GFP - actin and GFP - dynamin 2aa were not statistically different ( P 5 0 . 187 ) and were 1 . 89 6 141 min 2 1 and 1 . 89 6 0 . 236 min 2 1 , respectively . In contrast , GFP - dynamin 2aa K44A exhibited a slower recovery ( Fig . 9 , E and F ) with a rate constant of 0 . 55 6 057 min 2 1 . Based on these findings we investigated whether dynamin 2aa K44A has an effect on the recovery rate of actin , as expected if this mutant dy - namin delays actin turnover . FRAP analysis was per - formed on RSV - transformed BHK21 cells which had been comicroinjected with GFP - actin and a dynamin 2aa K44A lacking the GFP - tag . In these cells , GFP - actin had a slower recovery than in control cells with an average rate constant of 1 . 05 6 126 min 2 1 ( Fig . 9 , F and G ) . This was a statistically significant reduction as compared with the rate constant of recovery observed with GFP - actin alone ( P 5 0 . 02 ) . Presence of an Actin Sheath around Dynamin 1 – Coated Tubules In Vitro The working hypothesis of this study , i . e . , the possible presence of dynamin at tubular membranes of podosomes , had been triggered by the similarity of these tubules to the dynamin coated tubules visible on cell membranes incu - bated with ATP and GTP g S ( Takei et al . , 1995 ; see also Fig . 2 , F – H ) . Based on the close spatial relationship be - tween actin and dynamin observed at podosomes , we re - examined synaptic membranes incubated with brain cyto - sol , ATP and GTP g S for the possible presence of analogous structural relationship between the actin cytomatrix and dynamin . As previously reported , dynamin coated tubules , which are also positive for endophilin ( Ringstad et al . , 1999 ) are very abundant in this material ( Takei et al . , 1995 ) . Strikingly , these tubules were not randomly dispersed Figure 7 . Treatment of osteoclasts with the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A has disruptive affect on podosomes .

Bar , 70 m M . Ochoa et al . Dynamin at Podosomes 385 among other organelles . Instead , they were frequently sur - rounded by a cytoskeletal matrix and they appeared to represent the core of such matrix , thus generating struc - tures very reminiscent of podosomes in situ ( Fig . 2 , F and G ; see also Ringstad et al . , 1999 ) . The presence of actin in this matrix was confirmed by immunogold labeling ( Fig . 2 H ) . Discussion Our results reveal a structural and functional link between a pool of dynamin and actin . They demonstrate that dy - namin 2aa is a component of the sheath that surrounds the tubular invaginations of the plasma membrane of podo - somes . This sheath was previously shown to be composed of a dense actin cytoskeleton containing a variety of actin binding proteins ( Tarone et al . , 1985 ; Marchisio et al . , 1988 ; Nermut et al . , 1991 ; Hiura et al . , 1995 ) . Thus , our re - sults are convergent with those of recent studies reporting that dynamin directly binds regulatory components of the actin cytoskeleton , such as profilin ( Witke et al . , 1998 ) , proteins of the syndapin / pacsin / FAP52 family ( Merilainen et al . , 1997 ; Qualmann et al . , 1999 ; Ritter et al . , 1999 ) , and cortactin ( McNiven , M . , unpublished observation ) . The previous link of syndapin / pacsin to dynamin is of special interest because of the localization of a member of this protein family , FAP52 , at another actin attachment site , the focal adhesion plaque ( Merilainen et al . , 1997 ) . Podo - somes are present in cells with high levels of motility , Src activity , or both ( Tarone et al . , 1985 ; Tanaka et al . , 1996 ) . Since dynamin binds Src ( Gout et al . , 1993 ; Foster - Barber and Bishop , 1998 ) and can be a substrate for Src ( Ahn et al . , 1999 ) , their partnership is likely to be important in podo - some function . Podosomes are highly dynamic structures , even when they cluster in organized arrays , such as in the rosettes of RSV - transformed BHK21 cells and in the peripheral re - gion of osteoclasts . The fast and similar recoveries after photobleaching of GFP - actin and GFP - dynamin 2aa dem - onstrate that the cytoskeletal meshwork surrounding the central tubule undergoes very rapid turnover . This fast turnover is consistent with the function of podosomes as transient attachment sites in migrating cells such as leuko - Figure 8 . Expression of dynamin 2aa G273D and dynamin 2aa K44A in transformed BHK21 cells . RSV - transformed BHK21 cells were transiently transfected with GFP - dynamin 2aa G273D or with GFP - dynamin 2aa K44A as indicated . After transfec - tion cells were kept at either 30 8 C or 38 8 C as also in - dicated . In the cells kept at 38 8 C no podosomes are present . GFP - dynamin 2aa K44A is targeted to the po - dosome rosettes . All cells were counterstained for actin with phalloidin . Bar , 14 m M . The Journal of Cell Biology , Volume 150 , 2000 386 cytes ( Wolosewick , 1984 ) and macrophages ( Linder et al . , 1999 ) . It is also consistent with the presence at podosomes of WASP ( Linder et al . , 1999 ) , a key regulator of actin dy - namics via its action on the Arp2 / 3 complex ( Rohatgi et al . , 1999 ) . An attractive possibility is that dynamin may play a role in the dynamics of podosomes , as suggested by our analysis of dynamin 2aa mutants . GFP - dynamin 2aa K44A had a slower recovery after photobleaching than wild - type GFP - dynamin 2aa and dynamin 2aa K44A delayed actin dy - namics . Furthermore , GFP - dynamin 2aa G273D disrupted podosomes at the restrictive temperature of 38 8 C , but not at 30 8 C . The different effects of the two dynamin muta - tions may be dependent upon their different effect on fac - tors downstream to dynamin . For example , the GFP - dyna - min 2aa G273D mutant , but not the GFP - dynamin 2aa K44A mutant , may sequester some factor ( s ) crucial for the for - mation of podosomes . Podosomes do not have a direct structural relationship to clathrin coated pits or caveolae and are not thought to have an endocytic function . Thus , our finding extends the Figure 9 .

Bar , 14 m M . Ochoa et al . Dynamin at Podosomes 387 role of dynamin to processes beyond receptor - mediated endocytosis . We note , however , that narrow membrane tu - bules connecting clathrin - coated pits to the cell surface have been observed in a variety of cell types and experi - mental conditions . These tubules are surrounded by a cy - toskeletal sheath , reminiscent of the one observed at po - dosomes ( Willingham and Pastan , 1983 ) . Furthermore , it cannot be excluded that membrane may flow through the core of podosomes and that vesicles , non clathrin coated , may pinch off at their tips ( Fig . 10 A ) . Tubular plasma membrane invaginations which are sur - rounded by an actin cytomatrix and are very similar to podosomes , albeit generally much shorter , are present in yeast . They represent the core of the so - called actin patches which some studies have suggested to be sites of endocytosis ( Fig . 10 A ; Mulholland et al . , 1994 ) . Besides actin , many other yeast actin binding proteins are present in yeast actin patches and many of the mammalian homo - logues of these proteins are present at podosomes ( Bal - guerie et al . , 1999 ) . Such proteins include Sla2 ( Yang et al . , 1999 ) , Bee1 / Las17 ( Li , 1997 ) , Sac6 ( Adams et al . , 1991 ) , and their mammalian homologues talin ( Marchisio et al . , 1988 ) , WASP ( Linder et al . , 1999 ) , and fimbrin ( Babb et al . , 1997 ) , respectively . No dynamin - like proteins have been localized at yeast actin patches so far . It should be noted , however , that dynamin is not the only protein which can generate membrane tubules . The dynamin - interacting pro - tein amphiphysin , for example , is as potent as dynamin in tubule generation ( Takei et al . , 1999 ) . We note that the yeast protein Rvs167 , a homologue of amphiphysin , was recently reported to be localized , and to be functionally important , at yeast actin patches ( Balguerie et al . , 1999 ) . Our study provides evidence for a role of dynamin be - sides the more conventional role of this protein in vesicle fission during receptor - mediated endocytosis ( Herskovits et al . , 1993 ; van der Bliek et al . , 1993 ; Henley et al . , 1998 ; Oh et al . , 1998 ) . A role of actin in endocytosis is suggested by a variety of studies ( Lamaze and Schmid , 1995 ; Munn et al . , 1995 ; Wendland and Emr , 1998 ) and recent findings have suggested the presence of a cytoskeletal scaffold which determines sites at which clathrin coated pits form ( Gaidarov et al . , 1999 ) . As we have shown in Fig . 2 , G and H , a sheath of actin - like cytoskeleton can be observed around dynamin coated tubular membranes generated in vitro on synaptic membranes and the link between actin and dynamin suggested by our study may also apply to dy - namin isoforms implicated in endocytosis . A pool of actin may be present physiologically around clathrin coated pits , but may be very small and / or transient and therefore diffi - cult to visualize ( Fig . 10 B ) . Thus , the unique organization of actin at podosomes may have revealed a connection be - tween actin and dynamin which applies to other dynamin family members as well , but which is more difficult to demonstrate for dynamin 1 at clathrin coated pits . An im - portant question which remains to be addressed is the pre - cise role of actin in the endocytic reaction of clathrin coated vesicles . Actin may assist fission of the vesicle bud by constricting its neck via an actin - myosin - based mecha - nisms or by propelling the coated bud away from the plasma membrane via a polarized polymerization - depoly - merization cycle , such as the one which propels Listeria and Shigella within the cytoplasm ( Loisel et al . , 1999 ) . A direct role of comet - like actin polymerization in the sepa - ration of endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane ( Fig . 10 B ) was recently suggested by a study of pinocytic vesicles in mast cells ( Merrifield et al . , 1999 ) . In conclu - sion , the results of this study suggest a function for a dynamin isoform at actin attachment sites and , conversely , strengthen a putative role of actin in endocytosis . We thank Dr .
