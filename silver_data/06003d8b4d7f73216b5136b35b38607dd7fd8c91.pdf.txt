The AP2’s core , upon binding to membrane and cargo , releases a motif that can bind clathrin . In conditions where the core - membrane - cargo binding is weak , the binding of this motif to clathrin can result in a stable complex . We characterize the conditions and mechanisms resulting in the formation of clathrin lattices that curve the membrane , i . e . , clathrin coated pits . The mechanical properties of the AP2 β linker appear crucial to the orientation of the curved clathrin lattice relative to the membrane , with wild - type short linkers giving rise to the inward curving buds enabling endocytosis while long linkers produce upside - down cages and outward curving bulges .

INTRODUCTION Eukaryotic cells possess the remarkable ability to col - lect , sort , and internalize a variety of membrane compo - nents and external cargo molecules , by a process known as clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) . 1 – 3 The two main pro - teins involved in CME are clathrin and the AP2 adaptor protein complex , assisted by a series of accessory proteins . 4 Clathrin is a three - legged protein , see Fig . 1 , with the ability to self - assemble into a variety of polyhedral cages in vivo and in vitro . 5 , 6 In cages , a clathrin triskelion is centered at every vertex , with each of its legs running along two edges before bending inward at the leg’s terminal domain ( TD ) . 7 – 9 Cages grown in vivo enclose lipid vesicles , with the clathrin triskelia tethered to the membrane by multiple AP2 complexes . The lat - tercarriesmotifsforthephosphatidylinositol4 , 5 - bisphosphate [ PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ] lipids speciﬁc to the plasma membrane 10 and motifs binding cargo molecules , all located in the folded core of the protein , as well as two binding sites for clathrin on a long ﬂexible linker . 11 – 13 Crystallography experiments indicate that the mid - linker motif binding a clathrin TD 9 is only released by the AP2 core when that core has bound PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and cargo , 14 , 15 while earlier binding essays suggest that the per - manently available “ear” or “appendage” site at the free end of the linker binds a site higher up the clathrin leg . 16 In the highly coordinated process of endocytosis , 17 AP2 interme - diates by bringing cargo and triskelia together in a clathrin coated pit ( CCP ) , i . e . , a membrane invagination coated by a clathrin lattice . As the lattice continues to grow and curve , the membrane is wrapped until the above mentioned clathrin a ) w . k . denotter @ utwente . nl coated vesicle ( CCV ) is pinched off from the membrane . Finally , the proteins decorating the vesicle are released for the next cycle while the vesicle carries the cargo to an organelle for further processing . Clathrin also produces transport vesi - cles at other sites in the cell , in collaboration with a wide range of membrane - speciﬁc and / or cargo - speciﬁc adaptor proteins . 11 , 18 , 19 Current experimental techniques do not permit exam - ination at the molecular level of CCP formation in living cells . Cryo - electron microscopy produces high resolution stills of CCPs at various stages of maturation , thereby provid - ing insights into the structure of these CCPs 20 as well as revealing the presence of large ﬂat clathrin lattices . 21 , 22 Label - ing selected proteins with ﬂuorescent labels enables imaging endocytosis in living cells . 23 Fluorescence recovery after pho - tobleaching ( FRAP ) reveals that triskelia in pits are readily exchanged , unlike those in cages grown in vitro . 24 – 26 Total internal reﬂection ﬂuorescence ( TIRF ) microscopy unravels the sequence of arrival and departure of various proteins— including cargo , clathrin , adaptor proteins , and the membrane scission protein dynamin—over the course of approximately 1 min between the initiation and successful conclusion of an endocytic event . 27 – 30 Besides initiations that mature to com - pletion , these experiments also detect aborted events . 31 , 32 In two recent studies , single particle tracking is combined with photo - activation localization microscopy ( PALM ) to follow the internalization by CME of nano - particles in unparalleled resolution 33 and ﬂuorescence intensity tracing is used to shift the focus from the plasma membrane - coverglass interface to CCP formation at unrestrained membranes . 34 Despite the wealth of information obtained by these and other optical tech - niques , a number of fundamental questions on CCP dynamics 0021 - 9606 / 2017 / 146 ( 15 ) / 155102 / 18 / $ 30 . 00 146 , 155102 - 1 Published by AIP Publishing . 155102 - 2 Giani , den Otter , and Briels J .

Intherigidclathrintriskelion , three proximal leg segments ( P ) radiate from a central hip ( h ) to the knees ( k ) , at a pucker angle χ relative to the symmetry axis ˆ n h , followed by distal leg segments ( D ) running to ankles ( a ) and terminal domains ( TDs ) ending at the toes ( t ) .

The full AP2 protein also possesses a ﬂexible α linker , which is omitted in the simulations as it does not bind to membranes nor to clathrin . are still hotly debated . These include the mechanical contri - bution of clathrin toward bending the membrane , 35 – 38 and whether CCPs are formed by nucleation and growth or by gradually increasing the curvature of a pre - existing planar lattice . 20 , 26 , 33 , 34 , 39 – 43 Computer simulations provide a powerful tool to explore the statistical - mechanical feasibility of hypothesized self - assembly pathways of CCPs , based on experimentally deduced and / or estimated interactions between the key proteins . Matthews and Likos modelled clathrin as a triskelion com - posed of 13 bead particles with interaction patches on their sur - faces , showing that these triskelia can self - assemble into cages as well as create deep membrane invaginations . 44 Spakowitz and collaborators modelled clathrin as a particle that forms harmonic bonds with three neighbours to study the mechan - ical properties of lattices against a ﬂat membrane and the ﬂuidization of these lattices when the membrane is nano - indented . 45 , 46 Adaptor proteins were omitted in both types of simulations , by enabling the clathrin particles to bind directly to the membrane . The indirect coupling of triskelia to the membrane in cells—note that the disordered linkers of adap - tor proteins transmit pulling forces but not pushing forces—is likely to strongly affect the deformation of the membrane by the coat . We have developed a simulation model of clathrin as a rigid particle with kinked legs , see Fig . 1 , and with this model showed that asymmetric leg - leg interactions hold the key to self - assembly , related the binding energy to the crit - ical assembly concentration ( CAC ) , established a time scale for self - assembly in solution , and observed how ﬂat lattices release early CCPs when forced to curve . 47 – 50 In a recent study , we developed a simulation model for AP2 . 51 Several combinations of AP - binding locations on the clathrin leg were explored to separate combinations that enable cage assembly from those that do not , thereby arriving at the insight that the entropic spring linking the two clathrin motifs of AP2 is crucial to the functioning of this adaptor protein . The combi - nation of both binding sites residing at the TD , which was not explicitly mentioned in that paper , did not prove able to pro - mote cage assembly in the bulk . This may explain the recent observation by Moshkanbaryans et al . 52 that a newly discov - ered “site 1” on AP180 binds weaker to clathrin than eight previously identiﬁed TD - binding motifs yet proves crucial to AP - induced cage formation , by the hypothesis that site 1 is the only motif that binds clathrin at a location higher up the leg . Modelinganyprocess , especiallyoneascomplexasCME , involves making assumptions—based on the available exper - imental data—regarding the features to be included in the model and the details that can be ignored . In the current study , we explore the early stages of CCP formation for the sim - plest experimentally functional combination of components : clathrin , membrane , and an adaptor protein . 15 , 37 The clathrin protein is modelled as a rigid triskelion with smooth leg - leg interactions . Based on 10 6 triskelia in a cellular volume of 10 3 µ m 3 , theclathrinconcentrationisestimatedat10 (cid:12) 6 M . 53 – 55 A comparable concentration is used in the simulations , while the critical assembly concentration ( CAC ) of the model triske - lion is about an order of magnitude higher . 49 , 51 The model for AP2 is equipped with two clathrin binding sites to enable the protein to bring two triskelia together and thereby induce cage assembly , as observed in in vitro experiments . 5 Our simula - tions of this process indicated that adaptor proteins—and , by implication , dimers of adaptor proteins 56 – 58 —are ineffectual when binding to terminal domains only because of the rela - tivelylargedistancebetweenTDsinacage . Henceweincluded binding of the β - linker appendix to the ankle of a triskelion . Because of the modest experimental evidence supporting this second site , 15 , 16 , 59 we also present simulations without this site . Spontaneous AP2 - induced assembly of cages in solu - tion is prevented by incorporating the switching mechanism proposed by Owen and co - workers , 14 , 15 whereby a clathrin binding site on the β - linker is released only when the AP2’s core is bound to membrane , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , and cargo . Alter - native mechanisms exist , as , for instance , in neurons where the inﬂux of Ca 2 + ions triggers the temporary unlocking by dephosphorylation of a collection of adaptor and acces - sory proteins crucial to CME , collectively known as dephos - phins . 60 Recent studies indicate that FCHo and Eps15 form a complex with AP2 at the membrane , at least in the ini - tial stages of CME , and thereby induce AP2’s conformational change that releases the clathrin motif on the β linker . 61 , 62 The common feature of these mechanisms , i . e . , AP2’s abil - ity to bind clathrin changes when AP2 binds to the mem - brane and cargo , is incorporated in our simulation model . For reasons of simplicity , we do not include auxiliary pro - teins vying with AP2 for the binding sites on the triske - lia . 9 , 63 Nor do we include proteins that promote membrane bending , like BAR - domains and CALM , 64 – 66 or proteins that resist membrane bending , like crowding effects by bulky cargo proteins . 38 , 67 The model we have build , guided by the experimental data on a diverse set of proteins with complex interactions , is a highly coarse - grained idealization involving only clathrin , AP2 , and membrane beads , to gain a deeper understanding by statistical mechanical simulations of the minimum requirements for the formation of clathrin coated pits . The simulation models for clathrin , AP2 , and a lipid membrane are introduced in Section II . In Section III , the sim - ulation results are presented .

A . Clathrin 1 . The clathrin model In several preceding studies , we modelled clathrin as curved , rigidpatchyparticlestostudythe invitro self - assembly of clathrin cages in bulk through Monte Carlo and Brownian dynamics simulations . 47 – 51 We here provide a brief description of the model and refer the reader to our previous publications for a more detailed discussion . The model triskelion consists of three identical legs stemming from a central “hub” ( h ) at a “pucker” angle χ relative to the normal vector ˆ n h along the threefold rotational symmetry axis of the particle , see Fig . 1 . Each leg consists of three segments : the proximal ( P ) and distal ( D ) sections and the terminal domain ( TD ) , connected by the knee ( k ) and ankle ( a ) , respectively . All three leg segments are straight and of identical length , σ = 17 nm . The orientation of the distal segments relative to the proximal segments is chosen to allow the maximum overlap between the legs of a triskelion and those of a secondary triskelion whose hub is situated at a knee of the primary triskelion . According to the structural information ﬁle 1XI4 , 8 , 68 available at the Protein Data Bank ( PDB ) , the terminal domain forms an angle of ∼ 114 ◦ with the adjacent distal segment and a dihedral angle of ∼ 28 ◦ rel - ative to the distal and proximal segments of the same leg . We select a pucker angle of χ = 101 ◦ , as this value corresponds to soccer - ball cages containing 60 triskelia , the most commonly TABLE I .

( b ) Edges are composed of two proximal and two distal leg segments , with like segments oriented anti - parallel ; vertices are meeting points of one hub ( red ) , three knees ( white ) , and three ankles ( blue ) . For clarity , the leg segments are drawn next to each other . ( c ) The cross section of an experimental cage edge , along the dashed line in ( b ) , with the two distal segments below ( i . e . , inside the cage ) the two proximal segments . The markers (cid:12) and ⊗ denote segments pointing ( from hip to knee or from knee to ankle ) in to and out of the plane of the picture , respectively . Shaded areas highlight the hypothesized locations of binding sites ; their asymmetric distribution along the leg’s circumference is included in the simulation model by means of a torsion potential acting on the polarity vectors ˆ m . distal segments , where the amino acid sequences in both pairs of like segments run in opposite directions ( i . e . , anti - parallel ) . In our model , the interaction between two triskelia is described by a sum of inter - segmental interactions inspired by the segmental pairings observed in experimental cage edges , and thus attractive interactions are introduced between aligned pairs of two anti - parallel proximal segments , of two anti - parallel distal segments , and between any aligned pair of one proximal and one distal segment—the contribution of the TDs is considered negligible . The attractive interac - tion between any pair of segments is modelled by a four - site potential based on the distances between the end - points and the orientations of the two segments . All these attractive interactions are anisotropic under rotations around the long axes of the leg segments to mimic that the many weak inter - action sites are predominantly located at that side of the leg that faces the neighbouring legs along the same cage edge , see Fig . 2 ( c ) . Our previous simulations indicate that this asymme - try or “polarity” holds the key to spontaneous self - assembly of cages . 47 , 48 As an example , consider the interaction between the prox - imal segment of the α th leg of particle i and the proximal segment of the β th leg of particle j . When the two segments are properly aligned , their respective ends are close to each other . The two average distances between the four ends of these segments are r i α , hk j β , kh = 1 2 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) x i , h − x j β , k (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) + 1 2 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) x i α , k − x j , h (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) , ( 1 ) r i α , hk j β , hk = 1 2 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) x i , h − x j , h (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) + 1 2 (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) x i α , k − x j β , k (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) , ( 2 ) with x denoting the position of the speciﬁc joint indicated in the subscript . The distance on the ﬁrst line is small if the hub of i is close to the β th knee of j and the α th knee of i is close to the hub of j ( i . e . , aligned and anti - parallel ) , while the distance on the second line is small if the hub of i is close to the hub of j and the α th knee of i is close to the β th knee of j ( i . e . , aligned and parallel ) . The former combination occurs in clathrin cages , hence an attractive interaction is assigned , φ i α , hk j β , kh = − ε hkkh · f (cid:16) r i α , hk j β , kh (cid:17) · g (cid:16) ˆ m i α , P · ˆ m j β , P (cid:17) , ( 3 ) with the positive parameter ε hkkh denoting the ( absolute ) max - imum inter - segmental binding energy . The distance depen - dence smoothly decreases from unity for coinciding end points to zero at the cut - off distance r cut , following f ( r ) = 1 2 (cid:34) 1 − tanh [ A ( r − r cut / 2 ) ] tanh [ Ar cut / 2 ] (cid:35) , ( 4 ) where A determines the steepness of the potential . The numeri - calvaluesoftheseparametersareprovidedinTableI . Although this function favours the proper ( anti ) parallel alignment of leg segments , it leaves both segments free to rotate around their long axes . The cross section of a cage edge in Fig . 2 ( c ) , how - ever , suggests that binding sites are located at one side of the segmentandthatthesegmentsinacagepresentthissidetotheirneighbours . To model this , we associate with every proximal segment a polarity vector , deﬁned for the α th leg as ˆ m α , P = ˆ n h × (cid:0) x α , k − x h (cid:1) (cid:12)(cid:12) ˆ n h × (cid:0) x α , k − x h (cid:1) (cid:12)(cid:12) , ( 5 ) see Figs . 1 ( A ) and 2 . Alignment of the polarities of the two leg segments in Eq . ( 3 ) is imposed through g ( x ) = (cid:40) − x for x < 0 0 , for x ≥ 0 . ( 6 ) All other attractive interactions between segment pairs , see the tabulated list of combinations , are constructed along the same lines . Polarity vectors to distal segment ˆ m α , D are deﬁned as in Eq . ( 5 ) , based on the end points of that segment and the normal at the knee , which is obtained by mirroring the normal vector at the hub in a plane perpendicular to the prox - imal domain , running through the center of that segment , see Figs . 1 and 2 . Excluded volume interactions between triskelia are omit - ted for computational reasons . Their introduction would require a more complex particle shape and some ﬂexibility of the legs to enable the particles to interweave four legs along each cage edge . Excluded volume interactions are important in preventing a triskelion from binding to a cage in a position and orientation already occupied by another triskelion . This effect is reproduced by a repulsion between aligned parallel segments of the same type . For two proximal segments , the potential takes the form 155102 - 5 Giani , den Otter , and Briels J .

Propagator The trajectories of the triskelia are calculated using ﬁrst order Brownian dynamics equations of motion for translation and rotation . 69 – 71 Since a clathrin triskelion is modelled as a rigid particle , the position and orientation of all leg segments are fully described by the coordinates of its hydrodynamic cen - ter 72 r ( l ) in the laboratory ( l ) coordinate system and a rotation matrix A relative to the laboratory frame . In the laboratory frame , the coordinates of a site α on the i th particle are then given by x ( l ) i α = r ( l ) i + A i x ( b ) α , ( 8 ) where x ( b ) α represents the constant coordinates of the α th site in the body - ﬁxed ( b ) coordinate system . The latter is chosen as follows : the origin coincides with the hydrodynamic center , the third coordinate axis runs parallel to the threefold sym - metry axis of the triskelion , the ﬁrst and third coordinate axes deﬁne the plane that includes the proximal segment of the ﬁrst leg of the triskelion , and the second coordinate axis lies perpendicular to this plane , in such a way as to form a right - handed coordinate system . In Brownian dynamics , the effect of numerous collisions with solvent molecules is translated into a friction and a random term . The translational motion of the hydrodynamic center over a time step δ t then reads as r ( l ) i ( t + δ t ) = r ( l ) i ( t ) + µ t ( l ) ( t ) F ( l ) i ( t ) δ t + (cid:102) µ t ( l ) i ( t ) (cid:103) 1 / 2 Θ ti ( t ) (cid:112) 2 k B T δ t , ( 9 ) where µ t ( l ) i denotes the laboratory - based translational mobil - ity tensor , F ( l ) i is the sum of all conservative forces acting on the triskelion , and Θ ti is a random Markovian contribu - tion distributed according to a standard normal distribution . The random displacements are related to the mobility ten - sor by the ﬂuctuation - dissipation theorem , incorporated by the last term of Eq . ( 9 ) , where k B is Boltzmann’s constant and T temperature . The translational mobility tensor varies with the orientation of the particle , µ t ( l ) i ( t ) = A i ( t ) µ t ( b ) A T i ( t ) , ( 10 ) where µ t ( b ) i represents the constant mobility tensor in the body - ﬁxed coordinate system . The square - rooted matrix , which obeys [ µ t ( l ) i ] 1 / 2 [ µ t ( l ) i ] 1 / 2 = µ t ( l ) i , rotates likewise and hence the matrix square root has to be evaluated only once in the entire simulation . We have recently introduced a Rotational Brownian Dynamics ( RBD ) algorithm 50 to simulate the rotational dynamics of rigid anisotropic bodies by expressing their ori - entation in space through unit quaternions , i . e . , a set of four coordinates q γ , with γ ∈ { 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 } , and a constraint of unit length | q | = 1 . The rotation matrix A is then expressed as A ( q ) = (cid:42)(cid:46)(cid:46)(cid:46) (cid:44) q 20 + q 21 − q 22 − q 23 2 ( q 1 q 2 − q 0 q 3 ) 2 ( q 1 q 3 + q 0 q 2 ) 2 ( q 1 q 2 + q 0 q 3 ) q 20 − q 21 + q 22 − q 23 2 ( q 2 q 3 − q 0 q 1 ) 2 ( q 1 q 3 − q 0 q 2 ) 2 ( q 2 q 3 + q 0 q 1 ) q 20 − q 21 − q 22 + q 23 (cid:43)(cid:47)(cid:47)(cid:47) (cid:45) . ( 11 ) This description avoids the well - known singularities encoun - tered when using three angular coordinates , e . g . , Euler angles . The resulting algorithm , in the Itˆo representation , 70 is numer - ically stable and remarkably compact , with the i th particle updated by q i ( t + δ t ) = q i ( t ) + B i ( t ) µ r ( b ) i A T i ( t ) T ( l ) i ( t ) δ t + B i ( t ) (cid:102) µ r ( b ) i (cid:103) 1 / 2 Θ ri ( t ) (cid:112) 2 k B T δ t + λ i ( t ) q i ( t ) , ( 12 ) where µ r ( b ) i is the constant rotational mobility matrix in the body ﬁxed frame . The second term on the r . h . s . represents the contribution due to the torque T ( l ) i acting on the triskelion , and the third term represents the Brownian random contribution , where the components of the vector Θ ri are again Markovian and distributed according to a standard Gaussian . The transfor - mation matrix B i converts angular displacements in the body frame into quaternion displacements , 69 , 73 B ( q ) = 1 2 (cid:42)(cid:46)(cid:46)(cid:46)(cid:46) (cid:44) − q 1 − q 2 − q 3 q 0 − q 3 q 2 q 3 q 0 − q 1 − q 2 q 1 q 0 (cid:43)(cid:47)(cid:47)(cid:47)(cid:47) (cid:45) . ( 13 ) In the last contribution to Eq . ( 12 ) , λ i is a Lagrange multiplier used to constrain the modulus of the quaternion to be unitary . Its value is obtained by solving the quadratic equation (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) q ui ( t + δ t ) + λ i ( t ) q i ( δ t ) (cid:12)(cid:12)(cid:12) 2 = 1 ( 14 ) in every step , where q ui ( t + δ t ) are the unconstrained quater - nions obtained when λ i = 0 . The constraint also conveniently eliminates the calculation of a metric tensor correction and a drift term resulting from the q - dependent mobility , as both turn out to be parallel to the constraint direction . 50 The translational and rotational mobility tensors are related to their diffusivity counterparts by D = k B T µ . The latter are determined using the hydro + + package 72 by modeling clathrin as an array of 52 spheres arranged to reﬂect the overall shape of the protein , using a viscosity of η = 10 − 3 Pa s for water at room tempera - ture . In the body - ﬁxed frame discussed above , the body - ﬁxed translational and rotational diffusivity tensors are both simul - taneously diagonal , with D t 1 = D t 2 = 1 . 29 × 10 − 7 cm 2 s (cid:12) 1 and D t 3 = 1 . 07 × 10 − 7 cm 2 s (cid:12) 1 for the translational diffusivity ten - sor , and with D r 1 = D r 2 = 1 . 64 × 10 4 s (cid:12) 1 and D r 3 = 1 . 02 × 10 4 s (cid:12) 1 for the rotational diffusivity tensor . The square roots of the 155102 - 6 Giani , den Otter , and Briels J . Chem . Phys . 146 , 155102 ( 2017 ) body - based mobility tensors , as needed in the evaluation of the random terms , are then readily obtained by taking the square roots of the diagonal elements . The time step is set at 10 (cid:12) 8 s , which is the limit dictated by the rotational Brownian motion of the triskelia . B . Adaptor protein 2 1 . The AP2 model In a previous study , 51 we introduced a coarse - grained model for adaptor proteins inspired by the AP2 complex and used it to study their role in the assembly process of clathrin triskelia in bulk through Monte Carlo simulations . Only those partsoftheAP2complexinvolvedinclathrinbindingwererep - resentedinthemodel . Herethemodelisextendedtoincludethe core section of the protein , which was excluded in the previous model as it plays no role in the clathrin binding process in bulk . The two clathrin binding sites present in the C - terminal region of the β linker , i . e . , residues 631 – 635 and the β appendage domain formed by residues 705 – 937 , are modelled by point particles , β 1 and β 2 , respectively , see Fig . 1 . The ﬂexible , structureless linker connecting the two binding sites is com - posed of about 70 residues , with an estimated contour length of L 12 ≈ 26 nm . The linker , which acts as an entropic spring , 74 is modelled through a ﬁnite extensible nonlinear elastic ( FENE ) potential , 75 U 12 ( r ) =  − 12 k 12 L 212 ln (cid:20) 1 − (cid:16) rL 12 (cid:17) 2 (cid:21) for r < L 12 , ∞ for r ≥ L 12 , ( 15 ) where r denotesthedistancebetweenthetwobeads . Thespring constant k 12 is estimated using an expression from polymer physics , 74 k 12 = 3 k B T 2 L 12 l p , ( 16 ) where l p denotes the persistence length . With an experimen - tal value of l p ≈ 0 . 6 nm for disordered proteins , the resulting spring constant for the linker becomes k 12 = 30 k B T / σ 2 . The core section of the AP protein is responsible for binding with the membrane and cargo . Following the above reductionist approach , it is represented by an additional point particle , β 0 , and connected by a ﬂexible tether to the β 1 point particle , see Fig . 1 . This section of the linker , representing the initial section of the β linker and composed of about 40 residues , has a contour length of L 01 ≈ 15 nm and is also modelled through a FENE potential . The spring constant is estimated through Eq . ( 16 ) as k 01 = 50 k B T / σ 2 . The α linker and α appendage of AP2 are not represented in the model as they do not bind with clathrin nor with the membrane . 2 . Interaction with clathrin APs possess two different binding sites for clathrin that speciﬁcally bind to two matching sites on a triskelion leg . The presence of a binding site at the end of the TD matching the β 1 site on the AP2 linker is well established . 12 The AP2 β 2 site binds clathrin near the ankle 16 and possibly also at a site higher up along the leg . 59 In previous work , we explored the effect of sites located at the ankle and at the knee on cage assembly in solution , establishing that both possibilities permit AP - regulated clathrin aggregation . 51 Our study revealed that the mechanical properties of the AP linker region play a crucial role in regulating the assembly mechanism . Here , the β 2 bead binds to the clathrin ankle only , as this is the accepted site in the current literature . To overcome the numerically inconvenient short range of the AP - clathrin site - site interaction , we developed a click - ing potential to describe the AP binding interactions with clathrin . 51 Consider the interaction between the α th binding site on the i th triskelion and the β th bead on the j th AP . Said interaction is described by a ﬂag b i α , j β that assumes two values reﬂecting the discrete state of the interaction . In the unclicked state , b i α , j β = 0 , there is no interaction . In the clicked state , b i α , j β = 1 , the interaction is characterized by a ﬁxed inter - action energy (cid:15) CA and a maximum distance ρ CA between the two binding sites . The interaction potential then reads as φ click ( r i α , j β , b i α , j β ) =   0 for b i α , j β = 0 , (cid:40) − (cid:15) CA for r i α , j β < ρ CA ∞ for r i α , j β ≥ ρ CA for b i α , j β = 1 . ( 17 ) The two distinct clathrin - AP bounds , β 1 binding toes and β 2 binding ankles , are probably characterized by different inter - action parameters . Since neither interaction free energy has been measured , to the best of our knowledge , we here assume that both bonds are equally strong and explore a range of val - ues for (cid:15) CA in the simulations . The same radius ρ CA = 0 . 25 σ is used to describe both interactions . The click interactions are turned on and off by an MC pro - cedure . Attempts to modify the interaction status of a randomly selected AP binding site are made at a rate of r CA attempts per second and per AP bead . A list is made of all K possible binding sites within the interaction radius ρ CA of that bead , including the current site if applicable . The unclicked state is also considered , as the 0 th option . For each of these K + 1 trial moves , the accompanying energy change ∆ φ click k is calculated , which can only assume the values 0 and ± (cid:15) CA , and one of the states is selected with probability P k = exp ( − β ∆ φ click k ) (cid:80) Kk (cid:48) = 0 exp ( − β ∆ φ click k (cid:48) ) . ( 18 ) Note that the coordinates of the particles are left untouched . Excluded volume interactions between AP beads are omitted for reasons of computational efﬁciency . We note , however , that excluded volume interactions play an important role in preventing multiple AP beads binding to the same clathrin 155102 - 7 Giani , den Otter , and Briels J . Chem . Phys . 146 , 155102 ( 2017 ) site : this is effectively inhibited in the model by making the clicks mutually exclusive , allowing the AP and clathrin sites to partake in only one interaction at a time . We furthermore note that the total volume of all APs bound to a cage is signiﬁcantly smaller than the interior volume of the cage . 3 . Propagator The positions of the three particles composing an AP are updated separately , in a manner that depends on their clicking status . An unclicked bead follows a translational BD equa - tion of motion , see Eq . ( 9 ) , with an isotropic mobility tensor µ t β = µ t β I , where I is the identity matrix . The mobility µ t β is estimated through the Stokes - Einstein equation for isolated Brownian spheres , µ t β = 1 6 πη R β , ( 19 ) where η is the viscosity of the suspending ﬂuid and R β the sphere’s radius . Assuming a diameter 76 of ∼ 9 nm for the 200 kDa AP2 core and a diameter of ∼ 4 nm for the appendage domain , the mobilities of the β 0 and β 2 beads become µ t 0 = 1 . 2 × 10 10 Ns / m and µ t 2 = 2 . 6 × 10 10 Ns / m , respectively , in water at room temperature . Unlike those two bulky sites , the motion of the four - residue β 1 site will be dominated by the dynamics of the linker . For reasons of simplicity , the β 1 bead is simulated as a Brownian particle with the same properties as the β 2 bead . The beads do not rotate . We now turn to clicked beads . All AP beads clicked to a triskelion move with that triskelion ; the aggregate of a triske - lion and one or several attached AP beads moves as a single rigid body , obeying Eqs . ( 9 ) and ( 12 ) , subject to the sum of all the forces and torques acting on the aggregate . This pre - serves the clicking status of the AP beads involved , as well as their relative positions in the body frame of the triskelion . The translational and rotational mobilities of the aggregate are assumed to be identical to those of a free triskelion . On top of this motion , the AP beads explore the small clicking volume by Monte Carlo trial moves taking them to random positions within this volume , at a rate of r (cid:51) attempts per second and per bead . These trial moves also preserve the clicking status but alter the potential energy . Trial moves are accepted or rejected with a probability given by the Metropolis scheme 77 , 78 P acc o → n = min (cid:40) 1 , e − β ∆Φ o → n (cid:41) , ( 20 ) where ∆Φ o → n = Φ ( n ) − Φ ( o ) is the potential energy change between the old conﬁguration o and the new conﬁguration n . 4 . Chemostat In the relatively small volume of the simulation box , the adhesion of APs and triskelia to the membrane will strongly deplete their concentrations in the dissolved phase . To counter this effect , a chemostat is employed to maintain a constant chemical potential , and hence constant concentration in the bulk phase , by the insertionand removal of particles , thus mim - icking exchange with a large ideal reservoir . A Monte Carlo algorithm is applied to both solute molecule types indepen - dently ; in the following , we refer to clathrin as an illustrative example . Trial moves to exchange triskelia with the reservoir are attempted at a rate of r c attempts per second . The trial move consists in adding or removing a triskelion with equal likelihood . Consider a system with N C triskelia in a volume V . The probability of acceptance of an insertion move is given by 69 , 78 P acc N C → N C + 1 = min (cid:40) 1 , [ C ] r V N C + 1 e − β ∆Φ N C → N C + 1 (cid:41) , ( 21 ) where [ C ] r refers to the clathrin concentration in the reservoir and ∆Φ N C → N C + 1 is the potential energy change accompanying the insertion of a triskelion at a random position and with a random orientation . Similarly , the acceptance probability for the removal of a randomly selected triskelion is given by P acc N C → N C − 1 = min (cid:40) 1 , N C [ C ] r V e − β ∆Φ N C → N C − 1 (cid:41) . ( 22 ) Similar equations apply for the AP2 chemostat . The chemostat algorithm causes the numbers of triskelia and APs to ﬂuctuate throughout a simulation . For an ideal gas at constant chemical potential , volume , and temperature , the equilibrium distribution of the number of molecules follows a Poisson distribution . A test simulation was run using refer - ence concentrations of [ C ] r = 0 . 01 σ − 3 and [ A ] r = 0 . 01 σ − 3 , respectively , with all inter - molecular interactions turned off . Under these conditions , the system should behave like a mix - ture of two ideal gases featuring different internal degrees of freedom . Good numerical agreement was observed between the averages and variances of the number of molecules present and their theoretical values ( data not shown ) . C . Membrane 1 . The membrane model The free energy of a membrane is well described by the Helfrich expression , 74 , 79 F = 2 κ (cid:4) A H 2 da + 1 2 K A A 0 (cid:32) A − A 0 A 0 (cid:33) 2 , ( 23 ) where the integral runs over the area A of the membrane , H denotes the local mean curvature , κ the bending rigidity , K A is the elasticity modulus , and A 0 is the equilibrium surface area . In this form , the equation applies to membranes with no intrin - sic curvature , ﬁxed topology , and without edges . The coarse grained membrane model aims at reproducing Helfrich’s free energy . We simulate the membrane through a mesh composed of N m beads , connected by 3 N m ﬂexible tethers forming a multi - faceted surface composed by 3 N m / 2 triangles . The elasticity is accounted for by modeling the ﬂexible tethers through a FENE potential , U el m ( r ) =   − 12 k m L 2 m ln (cid:34) 1 − (cid:18) r − r 0 m L m (cid:19) 2 (cid:35) for | r − r 0 m | < L m , ∞ for | r − r 0 m | ≥ L m , ( 24 ) where k m denotes the spring constant , and L m the maximum deviation from the equilibrium length r 0 m . Self - avoidance of the membrane is guaranteed by introducing excluded vol - ume interactions between beads , modelled through a Weeks - Chandler - Andersen ( WCA ) potential , 155102 - 8 Giani , den Otter , and Briels J . Chem . Phys . 146 , 155102 ( 2017 ) U ev m ( r ) =  4 (cid:15) ev m (cid:20) (cid:16) σ ev m r (cid:17) 12 − (cid:16) σ ev m r (cid:17) 6 + 14 (cid:21) for r < 2 1 / 6 σ ev m , 0 for r ≥ 2 1 / 6 σ ev m . ( 25 ) The radius σ ev m = 0 . 35 σ and strength (cid:15) ev m = 10 k B T are chosen such that membrane beads are prevented from crossing the surface of any membrane triangle . A bending potential is introduced between neighbour - ing triangles . Several potentials have been proposed in the literature in which the mean curvature is calculated either through the angles formed by adjacent triangles 79 – 81 or using a lattice dual to the membrane triangulation . 79 , 81 – 83 The lat - ter approach , unlike the former , yields a bending rigidity that does not vary with the membrane topology 81 , 84 and is there - fore followed here . For computational convenience , we use a simpliﬁed version of this potential , 82 Φ = 1 2 k κ (cid:88) i φ i , ( 26 ) where k κ denotes the strength of the potential . The summation runs over all membrane beads , with φ i = 1 Ω i (cid:102) (cid:88) j ( i ) (cid:16) r i − r j (cid:17) (cid:103) 2 , ( 27 ) where the sum runs over all nodes j connected to i and Ω i represents the collective area of all triangles joining at site i . 2 . Propagator The motion of individual membrane nodes is described by a translational BD equation of motion , see Eq . ( 9 ) , with a con - stant isotropic mobility tensor µ tm = µ tm I . Membrane thermal undulations with wavelengths comparable to the clathrin size relax much faster than the time required for clathrin to diffuse over its own length . 85 Since we want to simulate both pro - cesses , we use the expedient of slowing down the membrane motion by judiciously choosing the highest mobility scalar µ tm that maintains a numerically stable membrane when using the maximum time step suitable for the triskelia , thus arriving at a diffusion coefﬁcient of D tm = µ tm k B T = 100 σ 2 / s . Networks with ﬁxed connectivity behave as elastic struts and prove unable to form pit - like invaginations under appro - priate forces . To model the ﬂuidity and deformability of the membrane , Monte Carlo moves are used to modify the net - work connectivity . 79 A random bond is selected and ﬂipped to connect the tops of the two triangles that hitherto shared this bond , as illustrated in Fig . 3 . This move leaves the posi - tions of the nodes untouched , but nevertheless it is likely to result in a change of the potential energy of the ﬂipping bond and of the bending energies of the neighbouring triangles . The acceptance probability of the ﬂipping move is again given by the Metropolis scheme in Eq . ( 20 ) . Note that the total number of triangles is conserved , while the connectivity numbers of the four nodes involved in the bond swap increase or decrease by one . In order to conserve the geometrical properties of the triangulated network , any attempt that reduces the connectiv - ity of a node below ﬁve is rejected . 79 Bond ﬂips are attempted at a rate of r f attempts per bond and per second . 3 . Interaction with other particles The membrane—with a main orientation parallel to the xy plane—ﬂoats roughly in the middle of the simulation box and thereby divides the box into an “interior” region above the membrane and an “exterior” region below the membrane ( where we , for the sake of argument , temporarily ignore the periodic boundary conditions along the z axis ) . The pres - ence of particles only in the interior region will result in an osmotic pressure that pushes the membrane down ; this effect is removed by employing periodic boundary condi - tions in the z direction because this allows the particles to diffuse freely between the two regions and thereby equal - izes pressures and chemical potentials on both sides of the membrane . A ﬂag l i is assigned to every triskelion and AP molecule to distinguish between those in the interior , l i = + 1 , and those in the exterior , l i = (cid:12) 1 . When a particle i crosses the periodic boundaries at z = ± 12 L z , its ﬂag l i reverses sign . Theinteractionof APbeadswith themembranecomprises two parts , a repulsion that prevents the β 1 and β 2 beads from crossing the membrane and a click potential that enables the core , i . e . , β 0 , to bind to a membrane bead . The repulsive bead - membrane potential should allow particles to come close to the membrane but not to cross the membrane permanently , a combination that cannot be realized in BD simulations by merely introducing a repulsive potential between beads and membrane nodes . Instead , we introduce an interaction between particle i and membrane triangles t of the form φ m i = (cid:15) m (cid:88) t F ( l i r ⊥ it ) G ( r | | it ) , ( 28 ) where (cid:15) m is a positive strength parameter . Using ˆ n t as the nor - mal to the triangle , pointing to the interior , one may calculate the height of the particle above the membrane , r ⊥ it = r it · ˆ n t , and its lateral displacement along the membrane , r | | it = | r it − r ⊥ it ˆ n t | , with r it being the vector pointing from the center of mass of the triangle to the bead . The above introduced ﬂag l i is included in the argument of F to ensure that the resulting repulsive force always points in the correct direction , i . e . , to the interior for l i = + 1 and to the exterior for l i = (cid:12) 1 , even if the bead has slightly penetrated the membrane . The penalty function F is zero for particles beyond a height x F , is quadratic just above the membrane triangle , and FIG . 3 . Cartoon of the Monte Carlo bond ﬂipping move , employed in the simulations to ensure membrane ﬂuidity and enable large amplitude deforma - tions . A randomly selected bond , here coloured in green , is ﬂipped from one diagonal to the other diagonal of the quadrangle formed by its two adjacent triangles . 155102 - 9 Giani , den Otter , and Briels J . Chem . Phys . 146 , 155102 ( 2017 ) increases linearly for particles penetrating the membrane , F ( x ) =  0 for x ≥ x F , ( x − x F ) 2 for 0 < x < x F , x 2 F − 2 x F x for 0 ≤ x . ( 29 ) The function G distributes the interaction over several adjacent triangles , reﬂecting the size of the protein fragment interacting with the membrane , G ( x ) = (cid:40) ( x − x G ) 2 for 0 < x < x G , 0 for x ≥ x G , ( 30 ) with x G setting the decay length of the spread function . In the simulations , (cid:15) m = 10 3 k B T / σ 4 , x F = 0 . 1 σ , and x G = 1 σ . The above repulsion applies to the β 1 and β 2 beads of AP , as well as to the hubs , knees , and ankles of triskelia . The core particle of AP is excluded to permit binding of this particle to the membrane , as discussed below . A modest ﬂexibility of the clathrin protein , allowing a leg to bend when pressed against a membrane , is mimicked in the simulations by a reduction by 90 % of the repulsion strength (cid:15) m for the extremal parts of the triskelion , i . e . , the ends of the TDs . The short - ranged binding interaction between the AP core , β 0 , and a membrane node is described , like the equally short - ranged AP - clathrin binding interaction , by the clicking potential introduced in Section II B 2 . Attempts are made , at a rate of r A m attempts per AP and per second , to click a free core with any available membrane node within a click - ing radius of ρ A m = 0 . 1 σ or to unclick a bound core . Upon clicking ( unclicking ) , the system energy is lowered ( raised ) by the click energy (cid:15) A m . Clicks are again mutually exclusive , to prevent two APs from binding to the same membrane bead . Structural studies have revealed that the AP2 protein under - goes a large conformational change from a “locked” state in the cytosol to an “open” state when bound to the membrane . 14 , 15 In the locked state , the β 1 site is buried within the core and only the β 2 site is available for clathrin binding , thus inhibit - ing APs from bridging two triskelia and thereby effectively suppressing the cage assembly process in the cytosol . Upon binding to the membrane , the β 1 site is released and the AP2 complex can bind two triskelia . This mechanism is mimicked in the simulations by allowing a β 1 bead to click to the end of a TD only when the matching core bead is clicked to a membrane node . Since a membrane - bound AP2 complex can diffuse relative to the membrane , in the simulation MC moves are included that enable the AP core bead to jump from its membrane node to a randomly selected neighbouring node , at a rate of r j attempts per membrane bound AP and per second . The acceptance probability of trial moves to unoccupied nodes is again given by Eq . ( 20 ) , while trial jumps to occupied nodes are rejected . 4 . Monte Carlo barostat Together with the bending rigidity , tension is a key fac - tor determining the membrane deformability . A change of the in - plane tension can be induced by an afﬁne rescaling of the simulation box , thus stretching or compressing all teth - ers forming the triangulated mesh . A vanishing tension is imposed on the system through Monte Carlo rescaling moves affecting the two in - plane directions x and y independently , while preserving the size of the box in the z direction . Attempts are made at a rate of r b per second to change the length of a selected box edge from the old value L o to a new value L n = L o + ∆ L , where ∆ L is a random number uniformly dis - tributed over the interval [ − 0 . 1 , 0 . 1 ] σ . Rescaling causes a volume change of the simulation box from V o to V n . The afﬁne transformation is applied to all membrane beads , the hydro - dynamic centers of the triskelia , and all unclicked AP beads ; clicked AP beads move with the bead they are connected to , in order to preserve their click statuses . The probability of accepting the trial move as the new conﬁguration is given by 78 P acc o → n = min  1 , (cid:32) L n L o (cid:33) N e − β [ ∆ φ o → n + P ( V n − V o ) ]  , ( 31 ) where N is the total number of molecules in the system— including the membrane , counted as one molecule—and P the imposed pressure . To obtain a tensionless membrane , P is set to zero . Since the two dimensions are scaled independently , the initial shape of the box is not conserved throughout the simulation . 5 . Model validation The mechanical properties of the membrane were tested using a system containing 1188 membrane nodes , initially pre - pared in a regular hexagonal lattice . The equilibrium length of the tethers was set at r 0 m = 0 . 5 σ and the maximum extensibility at L m = 0 . 8 σ . Typical experimental values for giant unilamel - lar vesicles of ﬂuid - phase double - tailed phosphatidylcholine lipids at room temperature were selected for the bending rigidity , κ = 0 . 4 × 10 − 19 J = 10 k B T , and the elastic modulus , K A = 250 mJ / m 2 ; 86 the former is realised in the simulation model by k κ = κ , the latter through the formula k m = 2 K A / √ 3 obtained by relating area expansion to tether elongation in a hexagonal lattice . During simulations with this membrane , the MC steps to swap bonds were never accepted and conse - quently the membrane displayed anisotropic behaviour . More - over , when initiating simulations with a membrane containing a hand - made pit - like dome , which required the introduction of beads with 5 or 7 neighbours , the pit was never observed to col - lapse spontaneously . Since the main properties of a membrane relevant for the endocytic process are its non - permeability and bending stiffness , we found it expedient to lower the elastic modulus to 1 mJ / m 2 ≈ 70 k B T / σ 2 . The resulting model mem - brane permits bond swaps and shows isotropic behaviour , and artiﬁcially introduced domes readily collapse . The elastic modulus of the model membrane was deter - mined by a series of runs uniformly stretching both in - plane box dimensions from L (cid:107) = 220 σ to 230 σ , with the barostat turned off . The tension on the membrane τ (cid:107) was calculated from the diagonal elements of the stress tensor , P αβ , where the latter was obtained by the virial expression . 69 , 78 When the elastic contribution dominates the Helfrich free energy , the tension is related to the relative elongation of the membrane by 87 , 88 τ (cid:107) = L z (cid:34) P zz − 1 2 ( P xx + P yy ) (cid:35) = K A (cid:107) 0 A (cid:107) − A (cid:107) 0 A (cid:107) 0 , ( 32 ) 155102 - 10 Giani , den Otter , and Briels J . Chem . Phys . 146 , 155102 ( 2017 ) where the membrane area is approximated by the ground plane area of the simulation box , A (cid:107) = L 2 (cid:107) . The stress - strain curve of the membrane is shown in Fig . 4 . From the slope of the tangent at the zero - tension intercept , at A (cid:107) 0 ≈ 224 . 4 σ 2 , we obtain an effective elastic modulus K A (cid:107) 0 ≈ 58 k B T / σ 2 . The curve is not the straight line predicted by Eq . ( 32 ) , and the elastic modulus is less than expected , because the contributions of the mem - brane undulations to both the free energy and the membrane area are ignored in that equation . Both can be corrected for , yielding 86 , 88 , 89 K − 1 A (cid:107) 0 = K − 1 A + k B T 32 π 3 κ 2 A (cid:107) 0 . ( 33 ) Upon inserting the bending rigidity ( to be discussed next ) , we obtain K A = 67 k B T / σ 2 , in good agreement with the input value . This value is also approached by the slope of the curve in the large area limit of Fig . 4 , where the high tension has effec - tively suppressed the undulations . Upon turning the barostat on , theareasofthesimulationboxeswereobservedtoconverge to A (cid:107) 0 . The undulations of the membrane are commonly expressed by a superposition of two - dimensional transverse waves . Taylor expanding the Helfrich free energy to sec - ond order in the complex amplitudes c q of a Fourier series with wave vectors q , followed by applying the equipartition theorem , yields the structure factors 87 , 90 S ( q ) = (cid:104) | c q | 2 (cid:105) = k B T A (cid:107) ( κ q 4 + τ q 2 ) , ( 34 ) where τ is the tension on the membrane . Figure 5 shows the results for two barostatted membranes with k κ = 10 k B T and 20 k B T , respectively . From the slopes of the ﬁtted straight lines , we extract effective bending rigidities of κ = 11 k B T and 18 k B T , respectively , in good agreement with the input values .

RESULTS A . Membrane coverage The beads of our membrane model perform three roles . First , the positions of the beads describe the conﬁguration of the membrane and the interactions between the beads endow the membrane with an equilibrium area , an elastic modulus , and a bending rigidity . Second , the multi - faceted plane formed by the beads acts as a barrier that prevents molecules from crossing the membrane . Third , the membrane beads act as binding sites for APs , in the same way that the combina - tion of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and cargo functions as the membrane - bound binding partner for the AP2 complex in vivo . The latter role is the focus of the current subsection . AP2 is modelled as a chain of three beads connected by springs , see Fig . 1 . The ﬁrst bead , β 0 , represents the core and can bind to a membrane bead . Beads β 1 and β 2 along the β linker are capable of binding to the clathrin terminal domain and knee , respectively . When the membrane is exposed to a solution of APs , a number of membrane beads will become occupied by one AP - core bead each . The fractional occupancy θ A is expected to be a function of the bulk AP concentration , [ A ] , and the strength of the binding interaction , (cid:15) A m . This relation was explored by varying the bond strength in a series of simulations using a membrane of 2064 nodes . A chemostat simulates the exchange of APs with a hypothetical ideal AP reservoir and thereby maintains a bulk AP concentration of 0 . 01 σ − 3 , irrespective of the number of APs attached to the membrane . To minimize interference with the processes at the membrane and to avoid possible superpositions of inserted particles with the mem - brane surface , the chemostat is applied only to a section of 155102 - 11 Giani , den Otter , and Briels J . Chem . Phys . 146 , 155102 ( 2017 ) the box well below the membrane , i . e . , in the “exterior” to the cell , covering ∼ 25 % of the total box volume . Diffusion of molecules between the “exterior” and “interior , ” via the peri - odic boundary conditions along the z direction , equalizes the chemical potential and osmotic pressure throughout the box . To accelerate the realization of thermodynamic equilib - rium and to improve sampling , in this subsection only , the membrane is conﬁgured as an immobile ideal hexagonal lat - tice , the barostat is turned off , and APs are not permitted to jump diffusively between membrane beads—note that these expedients do not affect the equilibrium occupancy . We remind the reader that the interaction between membrane - clicked APs is designed to prevent multiple APs from binding to the same membrane node , thus mimicking explicit excluded volume interactions that are omitted for reasons of computational efﬁciency . Clathrin triskelia are absent in this initial set of simulations . The simulation results collected in Fig . 6 show a smooth transition , from a low occupancy of the membrane beads to their near saturation with APs , in a narrow region of clicking strengths (cid:15) A m . A statistical - mechanical derivation of this Langmuir - like behaviour 93 is presented in the Appendix , yielding θ A 1 − θ A = [ A ] c 0 e − β ∆ G 0A m , ( 35 ) where c 0 denotes the standard reference concentration of 1M , and ∆ G 0A m is the change in the standard state free energy accompanying the AP - membrane binding reaction . That is , ∆ G 0A m = µ 0A m − µ 0A − µ 0 m = ∆ µ 0A m , ( 36 ) with µ 0X the reference chemical potential of component X at the standard concentration and ∆ µ 0A m the standard chemical FIG . 6 .

The inset shows a linear representation of the same data . potential difference associated with the reaction . The agree - ment between the theory and simulations is very good , see Fig . 6 , both in the absence and presence of the potential that prevents the two AP linker beads β 1 and β 2 from crossing the membrane . The reduced conﬁgurational freedom imposed by this restraint causes a shift of the equilibrium fractional cover - age function to slightly higher binding energies . Chang et al . 92 measured the saturation binding of AP2 on plasma membrane fragments prepared by freeze - thaw lysis of cells , which were stripped of their endogenous coat proteins before exposure for 30 min to AP2 solutions of various concentrations . Their experimental data are well described by the Langmuir theory , see Fig . 7 , yielding ∆ µ 0A m = − 17 . 8 k B T . Let us now consider a mixture of clathrin and APs , both subject to a chemostat . As in our preceding simulation stud - ies , 48 , 49 clathrin is modelled as a rigid triskelion with kinked legsfollowingthecharacteristicshapeoftheprotein , seeFig . 1 . Attractions ( repulsions ) are introduced between pairings of straight leg segments that are ( are not ) present in experimental cage edges . The interactions were originally tuned to simu - late in vitro self - assembly in a slightly acidic solution ; upon weakening these interactions , the model reproduces the in vitro regulation of cage assembly by AP2 . 51 The AP2 complex car - ries a mid - linker clathrin binding site that is available only when AP2 binds to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and cargo at a membrane . 15 This feature is mimicked in the AP simulation model by acti - vating the clicking potential of the β 1 site of an AP molecule onlywhenitscorebeadisclickedtoamembranebead . Withthe membrane bead representing a patch of membrane including PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and cargo , the β 1 sites of all membrane - bound APs are activated . The proper functioning of this feature is tested by temporarily simplifying the properties of the AP model to the point where the membrane coverage can be solved analytically . In this simpliﬁed model , the β 2 bead does not bind clathrin , the number of AP binding sites per clathrin is reduced FIG . 7 .

Inordertomakethistheoreticalcalculationfeasible , APhasbeencurtailedtooneclathrinbindingsite , whichisactivatedonlywhenAPisboundtothemembrane , the triskelia have only one site that clicks to AP , and the penetration barrier of the membrane is turned off . The green area below the dotted line in the two rightmost plots , while the leftmost plot is red at these low membrane - AP binding strengths , highlights a cooperative effect with APs binding to the membrane only in the presence of triskelia . The concentrations of free monomers in the solution are ﬁxed at [ A ] = 10 − 2 σ − 3 and [ C ] = 10 − 3 σ − 3 . Simulation results along the dashed and dotted lines are presented in Fig . 9 . toone , attheendofoneleg , andtheinteractionsamongclathrin triskelia are turned off . A statistical mechanical derivation of the fractional occu - pations of membrane sites by APs and AP - clathrin complexes is presented in the Appendix , and the resulting phase diagrams are depicted in Fig . 8 . In agreement with the simulations dis - cussed above , Fig . 8 ( a ) shows that APs saturate the membrane beads when the standard chemical potential difference asso - ciated with AP clicking to the membrane , ∆ µ 0A m , is lower ( more negative ) than about (cid:12) 12 k B T . Below this value , i . e . , for the high binding strengths (cid:15) A m at the top of the plots , with increasing AP - clathrin binding strength , (cid:15) CA , a transi - tion from predominantly unoccupied APs to APs occupied by triskelia is observed in Figs . 8 ( a ) and 8 ( b ) when the standard chemical potential difference associated with clathrin clicking to a membrane - bound AP reaches ∆ µ 0CA m ≈ − 12 k B T . Simu - lations with the simpliﬁed coarse - grained models , employing the acceleration expedients listed above , yield good agreement with the theory , see Fig . 9 ( a ) . Because this standard chem - ical potential difference is closely related to that of clathrin binding a ( hypothetical ) active β 1 - bead of an AP in solution , FIG . 9 .

Interestingly , the triangular green region for ∆ µ 0A m (cid:38) − 12 k B T in Figs . 8 ( b ) and 8 ( c ) , while Figs . 6 and 8 ( a ) show that θ A ≈ 0 for ∆ µ 0A m (cid:38) − 12 k B T , indicates that the binding of AP to the membrane can be strongly affected by clathrin : for the com - bination of binding strengths corresponding to the green tri - angular area , the AP - membrane interaction is too weak to induce AP adsorption , but the ( prospective ) release of the AP - clathrinbindingfreeenergy—whichrequiresAPbindingtothemembrane—makestheAPsclicktothemembraneneverthe - less . Thiscooperativebehaviour isconﬁrmedbythesimulation results presented in Fig . 9 ( b ) . If endocytosis is initiated by AP2 tethering clathrin to the plasma membrane in response to the detection of cargo molecules , then this sequence of events will occur in the current simpliﬁed model if the combination of AP - membrane and AP - clathrin interactions corresponds to a point in the red area of Fig . 8 ( b ) in the absence of cargo and shifts upwards—increasing the strength of the AP - membrane bond—into the green region of that ﬁgure in the presence of cargo . B . Formation of coated pits The aggregation of triskelia at the membrane was stud - ied using the full simulation model described in Section II . A chemostat stabilized the bulk concentrations of clathrin and AP at [ C ] = 10 − 3 σ − 3 and [ A ] = 10 − 2 σ − 3 , respectively . The interaction strength between the triskelion leg segments was set at (cid:15) = 6 k B T , which lies slightly below the threshold for spontaneous cage formation in the bulk at the chosen clathrin concentration . 47 Since AP’s mid - linker clathrin binding site is not activated in the bulk , cage formation is strictly limited to a small area adjacent to the membrane , as was conﬁrmed by the simulations . The CCP assembly phase diagram in Fig . 10 was obtained by varying both the AP - membrane click strength (cid:15) A m and the AP - clathrin click strength (cid:15) CA over ranges from 4 to 14 k B T . Each run lasted 1 s , requiring about 10 days of CPU 155102 - 13 Giani , den Otter , and Briels J . Chem . Phys . 146 , 155102 ( 2017 ) FIG . 10 .

The clathrin and AP bulk concentra - tions are maintained at [ C ] = 10 − 3 σ − 3 and [ A ] = 10 − 2 σ − 3 , respectively . Spontaneous assembly within 10 8 time steps ( corresponding to 1 s ) of at least one clathrin pentamer or hexamer ring from solution is marked with empty blue squares , a lack hereof by red crosses .

To the right of the dotted line , triskelia in solution are bound to at least one AP on average , by β 2 clicking to the ankles . time . All simulation boxes were visually inspected for the pres - ence of aggregates with at least one closed ring of triskelia , i . e . , a pentamer or hexamer facet of an incipient coat . Every marker in the ﬁgure represents results collected from two independent simulations at the same phase point . Clathrin lattices nucle - ate and grow at the membrane , see the empty blue squares in Fig . 10 , when the conditions (cid:15) CA (cid:38) 7 k B T ( ∆ µ 0CA m (cid:46) − 13 k B T ) and (cid:15) A m (cid:38) 9 k B T ( ∆ µ 0A m (cid:46) − 12 k B T ) are both met , while no spontaneous assembly was observed outside this region , see the red crosses . Due to the rarity of coat nucleation events at the membrane , mapping a phase diagram by observing sponta - neousassemblywithinarestrictedtimescaleprovidesanupperlimitonthelocationsofthephaseboundaries . A lower limit was obtainedby observingthe fateof simulationsinitiated with coated pit structures ( grown under conducive conditions ) ; the employed lattice comprised 24 triskelia , forming four hexago - nal facets and one pentagonal facet , connected by about 20 APs to a mildly curved membrane . For most parameter combina - tions , seededandunseededsystemsshowedsimilarﬁnalstates . The biggest difference between the two sets of simulations occurred for the blue squares inscribed by a red cross in Fig . 10 , marking conditions where coats appeared stable and / or grow - ing but their nucleation from solution was too rare to detect . Red circles denote lattices that partly or fully detached from the membrane and subsequently slowly disintegrated . Interest - ingly , spontaneous coat assembly ( empty blue squares ) is only observed in simulations where clathrin binds AP2 in solution ( to the right of the dotted line ) , in agreement with experimental data suggesting that clathrin arrives at the membrane with two attached AP2s . 30 A typical sequence of events during the formation of a coated pit is illustrated in Fig . 11 ( Multimedia view ) . Initially , triskelia diffusing into the neighbourhood of the membrane are tethered to the membrane by APs . Next , triskelia diffusing along the membrane meet and form aggregates . Even small diffusing aggregates have repeatedly been observed to merge into larger aggregates , a process that is rare ( and more difﬁcult to spot ) in solution . 50 The ﬁrst completed ring of triskelia is always a hexagon , probably because the resulting construct— an annulus with sprawling unpaired legs—is ﬂatter than a similar construct centered around a pentamer . At this time , the membrane underneath the ring is still essentially ﬂat , save for the perpetual thermal undulations . Small mobile aggre - gates have a clear preference to reside at membrane sections that match their curvature , as this reduces the elongation of the AP linkers and thereby lowers the free energy . This effect becomes more pronounced when imposing artiﬁcial undula - tions on the membrane shape to mimic the potential effect of , e . g . , BAR domains—bending the membrane inward attracts clathrin aggregates—or mutually repulsive cargo molecules— bending the membrane outward repels clathrin aggregates ( data not shown ) . A similar disposition of coats to curved membranes is observed in experiments . 94 With increasing time , aggregates continue to grow by binding additional APs and triskelia that form additional rings adjacent to previously formed facets . Most lattice patches remain fairly circular ; elon - gated structures arise occasionally , but they often cease to grow and have a tendency to break up into smaller fragments that can grow again . As a patch grows , its extremal segments start to poke into the membrane and consequently the central part of the patch rises . The multiple APs linking the central triskelia to FIG . 11 .

Phys . 146 , 155102 ( 2017 ) the membrane are stretched and eventually lift the membrane below the center of the patch relative to the membrane at the edge of the patch , thus inducing the membrane to smoothly curve toward the lattice and into the cell interior , see Fig . 11 ( b ) ( Multimedia view ) . With the continued growth of the AP - clathrin assembly , a clathrin coated pit is formed , see Figs . 11 ( c ) and 11 ( d ) and the Multimedia view . The bending resistance by the membrane puts the lattice patch under considerable stress . An additional set of simula - tions was run to study the stability of the lattice for various bending rigidities exceeding the 10 k B T of giant unilamellar vesicles of ﬂuid - phase double - tailed phosphatidylcholine lipids , as expected for biological membranes of more com - plex lipid compositions and attached proteins . In simulations seeded with the coated pit structures described before , the lattice was stable and / or continued to grow for k κ (cid:46) 30 k B T . At higher values of the bending rigidity , the initially curved membrane largely detached from the lattice and ﬂattened , remaining in contact with the lattice only at its rim ; subse - quently , these lattices tended to disassemble slowly . On these stiff membranes , the spontaneous assembly of clathrin aggre - gates ended with the completion of a single hexagonal facet . The unfavourable elongation of the AP tethers connecting the lattice to the unyielding membrane prevented these structures from growing any larger or fusing together . Clearly , this limit - ing size depends on the pucker angle at the clathrin hub , which we recall to be ﬁxed at 101 ◦ in these simulations , and on the properties of the AP linkers . The stresses exerted by the mem - brane’s bending resistance on the tethered lattice patch are also evidenced by the structure of that lattice . When rigid triskelia with a pucker of 101 ◦ are induced to self - assemble in solution , eitherbyincreasingtheleg - leginteraction (cid:15) orthroughthehelp of APs with a permanently active β 1 bead , they form stress - minimized near spherical cages of about 60 triskelia with a homogeneous distribution of the pentagonal facets 47 , 51 —the assembly appears to be guided by the “exclusion of head - to - tail dihedral angle discrepancies” 95 , 96 or “excluded 5566” rule . 51 The clathrin patches growing against the model mem - brane , however , typically have developed into a hexagonal facet surrounded by a ring of six hexagonal facets before the ﬁrst pentagonal facet forms at the edge of the patch . Such a conﬁguration of hexagons is not observed for cages grown in solution with the same χ but results from the stresses imposed by the tethering to a membrane that resists curvature . Because the initial patch is ﬂattened and denuded in pentagons , it is to be expected that the ﬁnal cage surrounding a vesicle will be larger than the cages grown in solution with the same χ , the twelve pentagonal facets will be unevenly distributed over the surface of the cage , and hence the cage will be less spher - ical . Cryo - electron tomography images do indeed show that clathrin cages grown during endocytosis deviate more from a symmetrical shape than empty clathrin cages . 6 C . Mechanism The role of APs in the aggregation and assembly process is explored by disabling either of their clathrin clicking sites . Since these modiﬁed APs can bind one clathrin at most , they cannot gather triskelia in solution and consequently will not induce cage formation in the bulk . But they can still collect FIG . 12 . Clathrin coats formed by mutant APs that bind clathrin only by the appendage β 2 beadclickingtoanankle . Theimagesareagaintakenfromavan - tage point inside the cell , looking down at the membrane . While coats formed in the presence of default APs always bend the membrane inward , see Fig . 11 ( Multimedia view ) , the coats compiled by these partially defunctionalized APs systematically cause the membrane to bulge outward . triskelia at the membrane and thus potentially raise the local clathrin density beyond the critical concentration to sponta - neous lattice formation . For APs binding clathrin only through the mid - linker β 1 site clicking to the end of a TD , the coat assembly process still proceeds as described above . Mutant APs binding clathrin only by the appendage β 2 bead clicking to an ankle are also capable of assembling coats adjacent to the membrane , for (cid:15) A m (cid:38) 10 k B T and (cid:15) CA (cid:38) 10 k B T . Surprisingly , these coats are systematically oriented upside down : the TDs now point toward the cell interior , rather than to the exterior , and these coats induce e vagination of the membrane , rather than the in vagination required for endocytosis , as illustrated in Fig . 12 . The upside down coats incorporate pentagonal facets at an earlier stage than the functional coats , indicating that the former are under less stress . Upside down patches are also observed in the presence of the default APs when conditions permit lattice assembly to commence in solution . When these fragments land upside - down on a membrane , they typically are anchored by a small number of APs , near the point of clos - est approach , and consequently hardly bend the membrane on the simulation time scale . Fragments landing the right way up become anchored by APs at the lattice edge but form few membrane connections in the center of the patch and con - sequently are also inefﬁcient in bending the membrane . We also observed upside - down coats for mutant APs with a func - tioning β 1 bead , irrespective of the β 2 bead , whose entropic spring constant between β 0 and β 1 has been reduced from k 01 = 50 k B T / σ 2 to 1 k B T / σ 2 , which approximately triples the FIG . 13 . Cartoonsofcrosssections ( top ) ofclathrincoats ( blackline ) attached to the cytosolic side of membranes ( yellow line ) and the adaptor proteins ( bottom ) giving rise to these coats . Right way up coats ( a ) are formed when the terminal domain of clathrin ( red ring ) is bound by an AP β 1 site ( red solid circle ) that is closely tethered to the AP core ( yellow solid circle ) , irrespective of the AP β 2 site ( blue solid circle ) . Upside down coats ( b ) are formed by mutant APs whose β 1 site binding the TD is connected to the AP core by a long linker and by mutant APs that only bind with their β 2 site to the clathrin ankle ( blue ring ) . 155102 - 15 Giani , den Otter , and Briels J .

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS The nucleation of clathrin coats tethered to a mem - brane by adaptor proteins has been studied by simulations . This was made possible by combining , adapting , and tuning coarse grained models for the two proteins and the membrane , using both soft interactions and click potentials , simulated by alternating Brownian dynamics and Monte Carlo steps . Simulations and theory show that the coverage of a membrane by non - aggregating AP2s follows Langmuir - like behaviour . The experimental data by Chang et al . 92 are also well described by this theory , see Fig . 7 suggesting that aggre - gation of AP2 plays a minor role . The release of the β 1 clathrin binding site by the AP2 core upon binding of the latter to cargo and membrane can lead to conditions wherein an AP2 core does not bind membrane and cargo in the absence of clathrin but does bind them in the presence of clathrin , see Fig . 8 . Along the same line , a small change in a living cell—like the arrival of a cargo molecule—may initiate a sequence of events—like the formation of a clathrin coat—by tipping the thermodynamic stability balance . The simulations show that the total free energy released by the numerous binding processes during coat formation can be sufﬁcient to bend a membrane into a coated pit . The stress exerted by the membrane on the coat is signiﬁcant , however . Lattice fragments grown against the membrane are ﬂatter than equally sized fragments in solution , and the formation of pen - tagonal facets is postponed till a later stage in the growth process . With increasing stiffness of the membrane , the growth of a coat may even cease after a single hexagonal ring has formed because the attachment of additional triskelia results in strong unfavourable steric interactions between these triskelia and the stiff membrane . Of course , a more detailed assessment of whether this process can proceed likewise in vivo requires additional quantitative experimental information on the bind - ing free energies of the proteins involved , on the bending rigidity of clathrin , both as monomers in solution and inter - twined in cages , and on the bending strengths and bending resistances of the auxiliary proteins and transmembrane cargo proteins involved . The rigid clathrin model is based on the triskelion con - ﬁguration and inter - segmental contacts in cages , and there - fore potentially biased to the nucleation - and - growth mech - anism of coated pit formation observed in the simulations . Besides experimental data supporting this mechanism , the lit - erature also contains studies reporting coated pit formation by the gradual curling up of pre - existing ﬂat hexagonal clathrin lattices . 20 , 26 , 33 , 34 , 39 – 42 The modiﬁcations of the clathrin model required to enable this second mechanism , like the inclusion of ﬂexibility and the reduction of inter segmental binding ener - gies to enable frequent clathrin exchange and lattice reshufﬂes , are a topic of ongoing research . The modelled second clathrin motif at the appendix of AP2’s β - linker proves crucial to induce cage assembly in solution , but the simulations indicate that this motif is not required for coat assembly at the membrane . This suggests two alternative assembly mechanisms : ( i ) in solution the adaptor protein itself brings two triskelia together , while ( ii ) at the membrane an AP binds to a single triskelion and diffusion along the membrane brings the triskelia together . Since the lat - ter mechanism appears to sufﬁce , it is unclear why AP2s are capable of inducing non - functional cage assembly in solution . We speculate that the β 2 site serves to accelerate the assembly of coats at the membrane . Comparing the AP models that give rise to normal and upside - down coats , it appears that the competition between steric clathrin - membrane interactions and the elongation of the linker determines the orientation of a coat . For the wild - type short core - β 1 linkers , a triskelion tethered to the membrane by all three legs will experience a signiﬁcant steric repulsion when oriented the wrong side up , i . e . , with its hub sticking into the membrane , and hence there is a strong preference to ori - ent the right way up . Upon binding to neighbouring triskelia , the resulting lattice patch will bend the membrane inward . For mutant APs with longer core - β 1 linkers , and for mutant APs that bind clathrin through β 2 only , this steric repulsion between a triple - tethered upside down triskelion and the membrane is much smaller , and consequently the probability of binding in the wrong orientation is much larger . The simulations suggest that small aggregates formed by these upside down triskelia are under less stress than regular lattices—they show a higher cur - vature at the same patch size , which indicates they spend less free energy on bending the membrane—and thereby further enhances their stability relative to the functional orientation . To the best of our knowledge , upside - down cages—which do not contribute to endocytosis—have never been observed in in vivo or in vitro experiments . It will be interesting to see whether these upside - down cages can be realised in experiments with mutant AP2s .

APPENDIX : ADSORPTION AT THE MEMBRANE In this appendix , statistical mechanical concepts 97 are used to derive expressions for the number of APs bound to triskelia and the number of APs and triskelia adsorbed at the membrane . For the reaction of clathrin ( C ) binding n APs ( A ) , C + n A (cid:10) CA n , ( A1 ) the equilibrium constant can be deﬁned as K CA n = (cid:16) [ CA n ] 3D / c 03D (cid:17) (cid:16) [ C ] 3D / c 03D (cid:17) (cid:16) [ A ] 3D / c 03D (cid:17) n = e − β ∆ G 0CA n , ( A2 ) where [ X ] 3D denotes the three - dimensional number density of component X , c 03D is a reference concentration typically taken to be 1M , and ∆ G 0CA n is the standard free energy change of the 155102 - 16 Giani , den Otter , and Briels J . Chem . Phys . 146 , 155102 ( 2017 ) reaction . In statistical mechanics , assuming ideal solutions , the above equilibrium constant is calculated as 97 – 99 K CA n = (cid:0) q CA n / V (cid:1) ( q C / V ) ( q A / V ) n (cid:16) c 03D (cid:17) n , ( A3 ) where q X denotes the molecular partition function of a molecule X and V the volume of the system . In terms of the chemical potentials of the reaction participants in ideal solutions at the reference concentration , µ 0X = − k B T ln ( q X / V ) c 03D , ( A4 ) the standard free energy change of the reaction reads as ∆ G 0CA n = µ 0CA n − µ 0C − n µ 0A = ∆ µ 0CA n , ( A5 ) with ∆ µ 0CA n the standard chemical potential change of the reaction . The partition function of a rigid triskelion in solution fol - lows from the integral of the Boltzmann factor over all particle positions r C and orientations ϕ C , q C = 1 ∆ C (cid:4)(cid:4) e − β Φ d r C d ϕ C ≈ 1 ∆ C 8 π 2 Ve − β Φ C , ( A6 ) where ∆ C denotes the elementary volume of the particle ( a combination of elementary constants , the temperature , the mass , and the inertia tensor of the triskelion ; the exact value is of no consequence as it will drop out in all major results derived below ) , with Φ the potential energy , Φ C the averaged solvation free energy of clathrin and where use was made of the Euler angles with ϕ 1 ∈ [ 0 , 2 π ) , ϕ 2 ∈ [ 0 , π ) , ϕ 3 ∈ [ 0 , 2 π ) , and d ϕ C = sin ϕ 2 d ϕ 1 d ϕ 2 d ϕ 3 . The AP model described in the main text consists of three beads connected by non - linear springs . The partition function of this molecule reads as q A = 1 ∆ 3 a (cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4) e − β Φ d r 0 d r 1 d r 2 ( A7 ) ≈ 1 ∆ 3 a e − β Φ A Vq s , 01 q s , 12 , ( A8 ) with ∆ a the elementary volume per bead ( for simplicity taken to be identical for all beads ; again , this factor will cancel out in the ﬁnal expressions ) , Φ the potential energy as a function of the particle positions r , and Φ A the average solvation free energy of AP . Integrating over r 2 at ﬁxed r 1 yields a factor q s , 12 = (cid:4) e − βψ 12 ( r 12 ) d r 12 ≈ (cid:32) 2 π k B T k 12 (cid:33) 3 / 2 , ( A9 ) where the linker potential ψ 12 has been approximated by a Hookean spring with spring constant k 12 . One obtains a sim - ilar factor when integrating over r 1 at ﬁxed r 0 , and the ﬁnal integration over r 0 yields the volume V , collectively arriving at Eq . ( A8 ) . For a dissolved protein complex of a triskelion bound to an AP by the β 2 bead , the partition function reads as q CA = 1 ∆ C ∆ 3 a (cid:4) · · · (cid:4) e − β Φ d r C d ϕ C d r 0 d r 1 d r 2 ( A10 ) ≈ q C q A V g 4 3 πρ 3CA e β(cid:15) CA , ( A11 ) where ρ CA and (cid:15) CA denote the radius and strength , respec - tively , of the click interaction between the β 2 bead and any of the g = 3 matching sites on the triskelion . This remarkably compact result is a consequence of the click potential , which reduces the translational freedom of one of the partners from V to the volume of the click interaction and contributes a Boltz - mann factor related to the clicking strength . 51 This insight is readily extended to triskelia decorated with multiple APs ; insertion in Eq . ( A3 ) then yields the equilibrium constants of these clathrin - AP complexes . If the membrane beads , in their role as binding sites for APs , are both free to diffuse over the entire membrane area A and sufﬁciently thinly distributed so as to ignore interactions , their partition function will read as q m = 1 ∆ m (cid:4) e − β Φ d r m ≈ 1 ∆ (cid:48) m Ae − β Φ m , ( A12 ) with Φ m the average free energy of a bead , and where the elementary area , ∆ (cid:48) m , represents the ratio of the elementary volume for a membrane bead , ∆ m , to the mean transverse displacement of a bead conﬁned to a membrane . The partition function of the complex of an AP molecule clicked by its β 0 bead to a membrane bead is given by q A m = 1 ∆ 3 a ∆ m (cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4)(cid:4) e − β Φ d r 0 d r 1 d r 2 d r m . ( A13 ) Upon ignoring the non - bonding AP - membrane interactions , i . e . , the potential that prevents the β 1 and β 2 beads from crossing the membrane , one readily obtains the approximation , denoted by a tilde , ˜ q A m ≈ q m q A V 4 3 πρ 3A m e β(cid:15) A m , ( A14 ) where ρ A m and (cid:15) A m denote the radius and strength , respec - tively , of the click interaction between the membrane bead and the AP’s core . By analogy with the above equilibrium constant in bulk solution , the equilibrium constant of the reaction A + m (cid:10) A m ( A15 ) can be deﬁned as K A m = (cid:16) [ A m ] 2D / c 02D (cid:17) (cid:16) [ A ] 3D / c 0 3D (cid:17) (cid:16) [ m ] 2D / c 0 2D (cid:17) ( A16 ) = ( q A m / A ) ( q A / V ) ( q m / A ) c 03D , ( A17 ) where the membrane beads and their complexes are bound to the two - dimensional membrane surface , and c 02D denotes a two - dimensional reference concentration . By inserting the preceding expressions for the molecular partition functions , one arrives at [ A m ] 2D [ m ] 2D = [ A ] 3D c 03D e − β ∆ G 0 A m , ( A18 ) with the free energy change accompanying the reaction given by ∆ G 0A m = µ 0A m − µ 0 m − µ 0A = ∆ µ 0A m = − k B T ln (cid:32) 4 3 πρ 3A m e β(cid:15) A m c 03D (cid:33) , ( A19 ) 155102 - 17 Giani , den Otter , and Briels J . Chem . Phys . 146 , 155102 ( 2017 ) where the reference chemical potentials of membrane - bound particles and complexes follow from µ 0X = − k B T ln ( q X / A ) c 02D . ( A20 ) Upon noting that [ A m ] 2D and [ m ] 2D are proportional to the fractions of occupied and unoccupied membrane beads , θ A and 1 − θ A , respectively , one recognizes in Eq . ( A18 ) the Langmuir expression of Eq . ( 35 ) . Returning to the partition function of Eq . ( A13 ) , the non - bonded interactions of the AP’s β 1 and β 2 beads with a locally nearly ﬂat membrane , taken to be the plane z = 0 , can be approximated by the conditions z 1 ≥ 0 and z 2 ≥ 0 . Evaluating the partition function part by part , the integral over r 2 at given r 1 then yields ˆ q s , 2 ( z 1 ) = 1 2 (cid:32) 2 π k B T k 12 (cid:33) 3 / 2  1 + erf (cid:42) (cid:44) (cid:114) 1 2 β k 12 z 1 (cid:43) (cid:45)  , ( A21 ) where erf denotes the error function . Assuming z 0 ≈ 0 and k 01 ≈ k 12 , the integral over r 1 at constant r 0 becomes ˆ q s , 12 = 1 4 (cid:32) 2 π k B T k 12 (cid:33) 3 (cid:32) 1 + (cid:4) ∞ 0 erf ( s ) e − s 2 ds (cid:33) , ( A22 ) which is readily solved by noting that the Gaussian is the derivative of the error function . The integral over r 0 proceeds as before , and by collecting factors we arrive at the remarkably simple result ˆ q A m = 3 8 ˜ q A m , ( A23 ) in excellent agreement with the simulation results in Fig . 6 . In the AP2 complex and in the simulation model , the mid - linker binding site for clathrin , β 1 becomes active when the core , β 0 , binds to the membrane . This feature of the model is tested in Section III A , using an analytically solvable simpli - ﬁed model system with only one clathrin binding site per AP , i . e . , β 1 , and only one matching binding site per triskelion . The partition function of a triskelion bound to an AP which in turn is bound to a membrane bead can be constructed by combin - ing the previous results in this appendix . Partition functions of molecules are typically calculated by integrating the inter - nal and rotational motions relative to the molecule’s center of mass , followed by an integration over the position of that refer - ence point . 97 We note that the partition function is independent of the location of the reference point relative to the molecule . In the case under study , it proves advantageous to calculate the partition function of the triskelion with respect to its single AP - binding site . The partition function of an clathrin - AP com - plex bound to a membrane bead , when ignoring the repulsive non - penetration potential of the membrane , then becomes ˜ q CA m = ˜ q A m q C V 4 3 πρ 3CA e β(cid:15) CA . ( A24 ) The standard free energy change accompanying the reaction C + A m (cid:10) CA m ( A25 ) then reads as ∆ G 0CA m = µ 0CA m − µ 0A m − µ 0C = ∆ µ 0CA m = − k B T ln (cid:32) 4 3 πρ 3CA e β(cid:15) CA c 03D (cid:33) . ( A26 ) The equilibrium of the two coupled reactions , Eqs . ( A15 ) and ( A25 ) , follows by solving the fractional occupancies of mem - brane beads by APs and AP - clathrin complexes , θ A and θ CA , respectively , from the coupled equations [ CA m ] 2D [ A m ] 2D = θ CA θ A = [ C ] 3D c 03D e − β ∆ G 0CA m , ( A27 ) [ A m ] 2D [ m ] 2D = θ A 1 − θ A − θ CA = [ A ] 3D c 03D e − β ∆ G 0A m , ( A28 ) where in the second line it was used that the fractions of empty and occupied membrane beads add up to unity . 1 F .
