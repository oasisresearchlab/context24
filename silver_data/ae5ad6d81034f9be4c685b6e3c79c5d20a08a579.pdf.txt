However , multiple issues are currently limiting the design and development of these services for reaching their full impact . Based on a recent field study , we present the criteria for a mobile climate service app for small - scale farmers in Namibia . It will be based on the KaiOS “smart feature phone” platform , and combines holistically climate , weather and agricultural information in a form that guides the farmer through the agricultural cycle . The app is currently in its early development phase , with a set of pre - selected features being built . Further field work with the local farmers will define the final set of features and the eventual user interface ( UI ) design of the app . Author Keywords Climate services ; mobile applications ; agriculture ; HCI4D ; ICTD ; co - design ; Global South CSS Concepts • Graphical User Interfaces Introduction As climate change is increasingly affecting the life of some of the most disadvantaged people on earth , the LBW141 , Page 1 CHI 2020 Late - Breaking Work CHI 2020 , April 25 – 30 , 2020 , Honolulu , HI , USA small - scale farmers 1 in the Global South , they crucially need information on how to adapt to the changing climate conditions , such as changes in the distribution and amount of rainfall . Climate services , defined as provision of climate information to help individuals to make climate smart decisions , are commonly proposed as a method of delivering this information in a way that is relevant and useful for the user [ 11 ] . Mobile services are being proposed as an applicable and cost - effective way to spread information to this large group of people , often based in remote rural areas . As the network infrastructure and device ownership issues have been mostly solved , the emphasis has been moving towards solving issues around the mobile services´ usability and the way how the information is presented on the phone screen , aspects which can prohibit these services for reaching their full potential as a beneficial way to provide crucial information to small - scale farmers [ 6 , 2 ] . Our team has been researching the design and implementation of climate services for small scale farmers in the Global South since 2010 . A recent field study took place in the Morogoro region in Tanzania . We interviewed local farmers regarding their information requirements and mobile phone usage patterns [ 8 ] . We also ran a limited co - design session , where we trialed various co - design activities for weather & agricultural icon design [ 7 ] . Based on our learnings from our field studies and extensive literature and report review process , we have designed an interface mock - up and workflow for our prototype climate service application . We recently started the 1 Alternatively called subsistence or communal farmers actual development phase , and the next field - based co - design sessions are currently scheduled for the coming June - July 2020 . The main aim of our app is to provide farmers with information , action options and notifications , based on the up - to - date forecast and current research , on how to cope with these changing climate conditions . Recently , we decided to relocate our project to Namibia , due to university level cooperation between our home university , University of Turku , Finland ( UTU ) , and University of Namibia ( UNAM ) . The first step of this cooperation was the opening of the “Future Tech Lab” in the UNAM main campus 2 . Therefore , our on - going development and co - design activities are going to take place in Namibia . According to our guiding principle , we will design and build concrete , functional apps , which can be tested and demonstrated together with the local farmers . The apps will show our interpretation on how somewhat abstract climate services concepts can look like as real mobile phone applications . Literature review The Global Framework for Climate Services [ 11 ] , which was initiated by the World Meteorological Organization ( WMO ) , as a steering framework for developing climate services , has a guiding role for our research . We are focusing on the “user interface platform” pillar of the framework , which refers to the interaction between the service users and information providers . By following the framework , we will ensure that our findings will be appropriate and applicable in other climate service 2 https : / / ftlab . utu . fi LBW141 , Page 2 CHI 2020 Late - Breaking Work CHI 2020 , April 25 – 30 , 2020 , Honolulu , HI , USA development projects , since almost all of them follow this framework . The overarching literature for this research covers climate services , mainly relating to the issues which limit their usability , adaptation and scalability among the small - scale farmers in the Global South [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 13 , 14 ] . The literature has revealed the following set of factors as key issues : the lack of understanding user requirements [ 1 , 5 , 13 ] , the usability of the services and the ways information is represented [ 5 , 9 , 14 ] . As an interdisciplinary study , we integrate HCI related studies , especially those on ICT usage and adaptation in the Global South , which reveals important background on how technology is used , and which design aspects work and what don’t in these settings [ 3 , 6 , 10 , 16 ] . Another important aspect relates to the co - design and community centric design approaches , which clarify how to conduct design research experiments in rural communities [ 12 , 15 , 17 ] . HCI is probably the most essential research context for this work , as a fundamental study of how users connect to the technology . As an indication of this , couple of essential papers , [ 6 , 10 , 12 , 15 ] among others , which have influenced our research , design and practical work notably have originated from this field . Technology overview We decided to use a rather recent mobile phone operating system called KaiOS , which the company defines as a “smart feature phone” platform 3 . The https : / / www . kaiostech . com system allows the use of HTML5 based applications in certain feature ( aka bottom ) phones , which are currently on market in 40 + countries , with 10 + different brands , with an estimated overall sale of over 100 million units . KaiOS allows the “best of the both worlds” type of functionality , where the users have access to smartphone applications , in a phone which has a longer battery life ( up to 28 days ) , a better durability and a more competitive price point ( around US $ 20 ) than traditional touch screen smartphones 4 . These aspects solve some of the commonly mentioned phone usability issues among rural farmers . These factors include charging ( no grid connection , solar or aggregate based charging stations which are rather costly to use ) , durability ( using phone with wet and dirty hands , exposure to dusty and moisty field conditions ) and cost ( users spend a considerable part of their income for buying phones , purchasing airtime and charging their phones ) [ 8 ] . Unfortunately , KaiOS based phones are not currently in sale in Namibia , but they are expected to arrive there as soon as its market area is expanding in Africa . We currently see Namibia more as a technology test bed , and not necessarily the sole end market for our app at this point . During our various meetings with the locals , people were interested in KaiOS phones features and they were convinced of the feasibility of these phones in the Namibian market , some were even willing to buy it straightaway . This shows the potential of the KaiOS based phones in Namibia , once the local Mobile Network Operators take them to their selection . 4 https : / / www . kaiostech . com / vodacom - launches - smart - kitochi - tanzanias - first - smart - feature - phone - powered - by - kaios / LBW141 , Page 3 3 CHI 2020 Late - Breaking Work CHI 2020 , April 25 – 30 , 2020 , Honolulu , HI , USA 1 .

Figure 1 : Weather event alert view Design aspects Our approach to climate service design and development is interdisciplinary , where we combine climate , weather and agricultural information into one single service . Our current iteration version utilizes a model where the app will show the information only when it is timely needed during a certain point of the agricultural cycle . From the technological point of view , KaiOS would also be suitable for the model where the user has access to all the information from the start , allowing them to study the information when convenient . In our prototype system , the agricultural cycle is divided into steps and the app gives timely relevant information for each step at that moment when it is topical ( see Figure 1 ) . We time the beginning of the agriculture season for the moment when the Consensus LBW141 , Page 4 CHI 2020 Late - Breaking Work CHI 2020 , April 25 – 30 , 2020 , Honolulu , HI , USA Outlook for the coming Rainfall Season has been prepared and published by the Southern Africa Regional Climate Outlook Forum ( SARCOF ) , meaning around end of August 5 . Example user case is the following . The user of the app , a farmer , is in process of making the decision of what crops and which varieties to grow at the beginning of the season . The app would then propose the optimum crops and planting times based on the seasonal forecast , farm location and other factors . Another example is a situation later in the season , when some erratic weather event occurs : the app will alert the user to take required preparation actions ( see Figure 1 ) . The app will also contain a “task to do list” type of function , where the user can see the necessary actions needed for a certain crop in its growing cycle , as well as receive notifications when an urgent activity , such as pruning or watering the crops , should be done . We are also implementing a feature which would allow farmers to contact the experts in cases when the information , which they are looking for is not available in the app or they want to clarify something . However , in all these cases , the farmer would have the final say on which actions they would eventually do , as the apps role is only to guide , not tell what to do . It is the farmer who is carrying all the risks , so they must make the final decision . The current features of our initial prototype app were selected and tentatively designed based on the literature review and our experiences on our previous http : / / csc . sadc . int / en / news - and - events / 265 - climate - outlook - oct - 2019 - to - mar - 2020 field studies . However , we will continue the design and development process , including UI design , adding and removing functions , together with the local farmers in the coming co - design sessions . In our experience , it is rather challenging to start with a blank canvas in these kinds of communities , where previous exposure to technology and its possibilities ( and limitations ) is generally rather low . Therefore , we chose to start with these design ideas – that , however , got inspiration and influence from our earlier field studies – and use them as a base for the actual co - design work . We are presenting those ideas here as a prequel to our next actual field research , whose findings will then be reported in the coming publications . The app´s features , as well as the information provided through it will also eventually vary between various geographical areas in Namibia , depending on the local conditions and user requirements , allowing it to be locally relevant We see that utilizing SMS messaging in normal bottom phones is the most relevant comparison point for this app in the climate service context , as SMS based systems are currently the prevailing way of delivering this information . Therefore , when compared to using SMS messages in traditional feature phones , a KaiOS platform - based app enables a better way of presenting complex weather and agricultural information , by allowing usage of symbols , pictures , audio and even videos . KaiOS also contains text - to - speech functionality , with certain languages , allowing an easier way of sharing information to low - literate people , without using specially pre - recorded audio clips . Also , multifaceted information is more accessible to the user in terms of browsability and linking relevant topics together . Another important factor in our case is the possibility to use notification alerts . This allows alerting LBW141 , Page 5 5 CHI 2020 Late - Breaking Work CHI 2020 , April 25 – 30 , 2020 , Honolulu , HI , USA users when the app has something new , timely or otherwise relevant information to show for the user or when the user should complete a certain timely action ( see Figure 1 ) . As of now , we are not cooperating with any National Meteorological Service nor research organization , instead we are relying on the publicly available weather and climate data in our prototype . Currently we are focusing on solving the technical aspects on how this multidisciplinary information could be presented in the app . We aim to find partners which can provide the needed weather & climate data and agricultural information or otherwise make use of the increasingly available open data . We are prepared to integrate third party APIs to our app , so we can connect to any available database , which can provide information in the appropriate form . Conclusion We assume that our design interpretation is at least partly solving some of the design issues raised up in the literature , as well as providing a truly multidisciplinary information for farmers and that way solving their information demands . This being one of the first research - oriented projects on the KaiOS platform , it can also open new research ideas for the HCI field in terms of utilizing the “smart feature phone” platform in other research projects and studies . This extended abstract aims to work as a prequal for our ongoing and future research work , with a goal to present this research project to the HCI field and get their input and feedback . Our next goal is to field test and further design these application functionalities together with the local small - scale farmers in Northern Namibia during mid 2020 . We expect this phase to bring interesting results , both for the future development actions of this application , as well as for HCI4D and ICTD scenes , mainly in terms of user interface design and usability . Recently we have also included a couple of local university students into the app design and development process , in order to get the local view to the topic , as well as novel ideas for the functionalities and UI design . Another purpose is to train local talent , which would be needed in the scale - up and upkeep phases , as well as building local ownership for the end product . We are also planning a unique scale - up model , which is based on collaborating with the local developers , based in the different regions of the country , whose role would be to adapt the app in the local conditions . This is especially important in highly diverse countries , such as Namibia , where regions vary significantly in terms of agroecological , cultural and economic factors . References [ 1 ] Guy P .
