Introduction Polyomavirus research has been central to cancer biology ( 1 ) . Studies on simian vacuolating virus 40 ( SV40 ) T antigen led to the discovery of p53 and uncovered functions for the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein ( RB1 ) in cell cycle regulation ( 2 – 4 ) . Research on murine polyomavirus led to the discovery of tyrosine phosphorylation ( 5 ) and the PI3K signaling pathway ( 6 ) . More recently , defined elements required for oncogenic transformation of primary human cells has been identified through expression of SV40 T antigens together with h - telomerase reverse transcriptase and activated h - Ras ( 7 , 8 ) . Merkel cell polyomavirus ( MCV ) was discovered using digital transcriptome subtraction of Merkel cell carcinoma ( MCC ) ( 9 ) . MCC is a clinically aggressive skin cancer that occurs in approxi - mately 1 , 700 Americans each year , often in individuals with immu - nosuppression . MCV is clonally integrated into approximately 80 % of MCC tumors , but not other common tumors ( 10 – 13 ) . MCV is related to the animal tumor virus SV40 , and like SV40 , MCV T anti - gens are generated by differential splicing to produce large T ( LT ) , small T ( sT ) , and 57kT antigen proteins ( 10 , 11 ) . sT mRNA shares a common exon 1 with LT , but reads through a splice junction pres - ent in LT mRNA to generate a short ( 18 kDa ) alternative reading frame protein possessing unique cellular targeting features . In tumors , not only is MCV clonally integrated into the tumor cell genome , but it also has various mutations at the 3 ′ end of the T anti - gen gene . These mutations eliminate LT viral helicase activity , but are downstream of the sT open reading frame ( 10 , 14 ) . Experimental evi - dence showing a causal contribution of MCV to MCC tumors comes from knockdown experiments targeting T antigen exon 1 , which inhibits expression of all MCV T antigens ( 15 ) . This knockdown causes cell death and cell cycle arrest only in MCV - positive MCC cell lines , confirming the requirement of MCV T antigens in virus - posi - tive MCC . In MCC tumor biopsies , an MCV LT mAb detects the viral protein in most , but not all , MCV - positive MCC tumors ( 11 ) . Finally , patient antibodies directed against the common T antigen sequence predict MCC tumor load and recurrence ( 11 , 15 , 16 ) . Although there is little doubt that MCV is a newly described cause of human cancer , nothing is currently known about its mechanisms for cell transformation . Instead , speculation regard - ing its likely mechanisms must be inferred from related animal polyomaviruses . Polyomavirus T antigens target cell cycle regula - tory proteins , and the MCV LT antigen encodes DnaJ and RB1 - interacting domains that are unaffected by tumor - specific muta - tions ( 10 ) . However , regions of the MCV LT antigen corresponding to those of SV40 LT that bind p53 ( 2 ) , are frequently lost through tumor - derived mutations . Polyomavirus targeting of the PI3K - Akt - mTOR signaling pathway ( Figure 1 ) may also contribute to carcinogenesis ( 8 , 17 ) . The MCV sT antigen has a PP2A - interaction domain in its C - terminal region ( 14 ) that is similar to those found in other animal polyomaviruses , including the SV40 sT and the murine polyomavirus sT and middle T ( MT ) ( 18 ) . Both murine polyomavirus sT / MT and SV40 sT bind the PP2A structural A α subunit as well as the catalytic C subunit , dis - placing specific B subunits from the PP2A holoenzyme to inactivate or retarget PP2A enzymatic activity ( 18 – 20 ) . SV40 sT activates Akt by preventing its dephosphorylation by PP2A ( 21 , 22 ) . SV40 sT alone is not transforming in rodent cell assays , but it enhances transforma - tion by SV40 LT ( 23 ) and contributes to defined oncogene - induced transformation of human cells through PP2A targeting ( 8 ) .

A key step in cap - dependent translation is the binding of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E ( eIF4E ) to mRNA mole - cules having a 5 ′ 7 - methylguanosine GTP cap ( 27 ) . Ribosome recruit - ment to capped mRNAs is initiated by the assembly of the multisub - unit eIF4F , composed of eIF4E , eIF4A , and eIF4G , on the cap . A key regulator of this process is the eukaryotic translation initiation fac - tor 4E - binding protein 1 ( 4E - BP1 ) , which sequesters eIF4E to prevent eIF4F formation on capped mRNA ( 28 ) . Induction of cap - dependent translation may play a role in tumor cell growth , since eIF4E overex - pression causes rodent cell transformation ( 29 , 30 ) . 4E - BP1 binding to eIF4E is inhibited when 4E - BP1 is phosphorylated by mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR ) kinase . Hyperphosphorylation of 4E - BP1 by mTOR causes 4E - BP1 to release eIF4E , allowing free eIF4E to form the cap assem - bly and to initiate cap - dependent translation ( 31 ) . Phosphoryla - tion of 4E - BP1 occurs in a stepwise fashion and involves several sites : first at threonine 37 ( T37 ) and T46 ( in humans ) , priming 4E - BP1 for subsequent hyperphosphorylation at T70 , and finally serine 65 ( S65 ) residues by mTOR complex 1 ( mTORC1 ) , leading to dissociation of 4E - BP1 from eIF4E ( 32 ) . Hypophosphorylated 4E - BP1 ( α and β forms ) migrate faster on polyacrylamide gels than do hyperphosphorylated ( γ and δ ) forms . mTORC1 - induced 4E - BP1 hyperphosphorylation promotes mitogenesis and cell proliferation , which can be differentiated from other mTORC1 activities ( 25 ) . For example , phosphoryla - tion of ribosomal protein S6 kinase ( S6K ) , another direct mTOR phosphorylation target , plays a role in cell size and ribosomal biogenesis rather than cell proliferation ( 25 ) . SV40 sT protein has been reported to dephosphorylate 4E - BP1 , possibly by antagoniz - ing mTOR to inhibit cap - dependent translation ( 33 ) . In this study , we showed that MCV sT protein was detected in human MCC tumors more commonly than was MCV LT . Knockdown of MCV sT alone retarded MCV - positive cell growth , which indicates that MCV sT expression is required for tumor cell proliferation . We also found that MCV sT behaved very dif - ferently from sT proteins reported from other polyomaviruses . MCV sT transformed rodent cells , whereas MCV LT did not . MCV sT – induced transformation was not dependent on MCV sT PP2 Α or heat shock protein – binding activities . Instead , MCV sT reduced turnover of hyperphosphorylated 4E - BP1 , which in turn increased eIF4E activity . Expression of a constitutively active 4E - BP1 that cannot be phosphorylated reversed MCV sT – induced cell transformation , which showed that the proliferative effects of MCV sT are caused by targeting downstream components of the Akt - mTOR pathway . These findings indicate that MCV sT targets cap - dependent translation though a mechanism that contributes to Merkel cell tumorigenesis . Results MCV sT protein expression in LT - negative MCC tumors . The CM5E1 mAb , raised against a peptide epitope in sT ( Supplemental Fig - ure 1 ; supplemental material available online with this article ; doi : 10 . 1172 / JCI46323DS1 ) , distinguished the 18 - kDa sT protein from other MCV T antigen isoforms detected by MCV LT – specific ( CM2B4 ; ref . 11 ) or pan – T antigen – detecting ( CM8E6 ; ref . 14 ) mAbs ( Supplemental Figure 2A ) . CM5E1 detected endogenous sT protein expression in MCV - infected MCC cell lines ( Supplemental Figure 2B ) , and immunofluorescence showed that it was present in the cytoplasm as well as the nucleus when expressed in 293 cells ( Supplemental Figure 2C ) . MCV sT antigen was expressed in MCC , and it was more com - monly detected than MCV LT antigen in MCV - positive tumors . As shown for case MCCR10 - 123 , sT protein was expressed only in MCC tumor cells and not in adjacent stromal cells ( Figure 2A ) , a staining pattern similar to that of MCV LT ( Figure 2B and ref . 11 ) . Of 51 consecutively collected , formalin - fixed and cytokeratin 20 – positive ( CK20 - positive ) MCC tumors , 47 ( 92 % ) stained posi - tive for MCV sT expression compared with 38 ( 75 % ) positive for MCV LT ( P < 0 . 05 , 1 - tailed Fisher exact test ; Figure 2G ) . Only 3 of the 51 MCC tumors ( 6 % ) were negative for both MCV LT and sT staining . Among MCCs positive for MCV sT , staining intensi - ties with CM5E1 were reproducible but generally lower than those seen for the 2 tumors in Figure 2 . This may reflect low levels of sT expression being typical in MCCs . Figure 2 , D and E , illustrated that some MCC tumors that were positive for MCV DNA were negative for MCV LT protein expres - sion , yet retained expression of the MCV sT . The MCC tumor MCC344 was previously described to be negative for MCV LT anti - gen expression , although it harbors at least 6 MCV viral genome copies per cell that have been partially sequenced and found to retain the MCV LT mAb epitope sequence ( 9 , 11 ) . This tumor had robust MCV sT antigen staining ( Figure 2D ) , but no staining for MCV LT antigen ( Figure 2E ) . Both cases were negative for SV40 LT expression using the anti – SV40 LT antibody PAb419 as a negative control ( Figure 2 , C and F ) . Thus , MCV sT antigen was commonly expressed in MCV - positive tumors , even in a substantial fraction of cases in which MCV LT antigen was not detected . Figure 1 Akt - mTOR pathway . Activities of Akt , mTORC1 ( Raptor complex ) , mTORC2 ( Rictor complex ) , and S6K kinases are shown . mTORC1 phosphorylates and inhibits 4E - BP1 , which prevents 4E - BP1 from sequestering the eIF4E cap - dependent translation factor . Kinase inhib - itors used in this study are shown in blue , and the respective targets are designated by dotted lines . research article The Journal of Clinical Investigation http : / / www . jci . org Volume 121 Number 9 September 2011 3625 MCV sT is an oncoprotein required for growth of MCV - positive MCC cell lines . We previously showed that shRNA targeting of the common MCV T antigen exon 1 causes pan – T antigen knockdown of both LT and sT and inhibits growth of MCV - infected cell lines ( 15 ) . As a result of overlapping 3 ′ coterminal transcripts , LT cannot be read - ily targeted independent of sT ( Supplemental Figure 1 ) . MCV sT mRNA , however , could be knocked down without affecting LT pro - tein expression by targeting the intron 1 sequence ( Figure 3A ) . A lentiviral shRNA that knocks down only the sT in MCV - positive MKL - 1 cells ( referred to herein as sT1 shRNA ) inhibited MKL - 1 cell growth to a similar extent as did shRNA knockdown with an shRNA targeting pan – T antigen exon 1 sequence ( referred to herein as pan - T1 shRNA ) ; conversely , control shRNA had no activity ( Figure 3B ) . Proliferation of the virus - negative MCC cell lines UISO and MCC13 was unaffected by either sT or pan – T antigen knockdown ( Figure 3B and data not shown ) , which indicates that this is not due to an off - target effect . Pan – T antigen knockdown was more efficient in inhib - iting cell cycle entry , measured by BrdU incorporation , than was sT knockdown alone , but cell cycle progression was also reproducibly diminished by sT targeting in MCV - positive MCC cells ( Figure 3C ) . Knockdown of sT did not cause MCC cell death , as measured by LDH release assays ( Figure 3D ) , in contrast to pan - T knockdown ( 15 ) . Thus , both MCV LT and MCV sT proteins are likely to sepa - rately contribute to MCV - positive MCC tumorigenesis . Expression of MCV sT , but not MCV LT , results in rodent fibroblast transformation and human fibroblast serum - independent growth . Codon - optimized cDNAs for MCV sT and MCV LT were cloned into len - tivirus vectors and expressed in Rat - 1 cells . Only sT - expressing cells formed dense foci compared with the empty vector control ( 32 vs . 0 foci per 60 - mm dish ; Figure 4 , A and B ) . Truncated , tumor - derived LT cDNAs ( LT . 339 and LT . 350 ) also did not induce foci formation ( Figure 4A ) . These results were confirmed by an assay for anchorage - independent growth in soft agar ( Figure 4C and Supplemental Figure 3A ) , in which Rat - 1 cells were bulk - selected for stable transduction and seeded onto soft agar plates , after which colonies were counted . Rat - 1 cells expressing MCV sT readily formed colonies in soft agar , but cells selected for empty vector , full - length LT , or tumor - derived LT remained as nondi - viding , single cells up to 14 days after plating ( Figure 4 , C and D , and Supplemental Figure 3 , A and B ) . These results were inde - pendently replicated using mouse NIH3T3 cells ( Supplemental Figure 3C ) . Truncated tumor - derived LT proteins induced sparse multicellular aggregates in soft agar , but did not grow into full colonies ( Supplemental Figure 3A ) , which suggests that truncat - ed LT cDNAs have increased cell proliferative capacity compared with the wild - type LT , but , unlike sT , did not fully transform rodent fibroblasts . Dual selection of both sT and tumor - derived LT proteins did not enhance colony formation compared with expression of sT alone ( Supplemental Figure 3A ) . For Rat - 1 cells , proliferation was accelerated by expression of MCV sT and , after delay , by LT expression ( Supplemental Figure 3D ) . MCV sT expression also accelerated human fibroblast prolif - eration ( Figure 5A ) . BJ fibroblasts immortalized with telomerase reverse transcriptase ( BJ - TERT cells ) were transduced with MCV sT and grown in 10 % or 0 % fetal calf serum . In the complete absence of serum , sT expression sustained modest BJ - TERT cell replica - tion , whereas cells infected with empty vector fully arrested and had negligible S - phase entry ( Figure 5B ) . MCV sT expression alone was not able to fully transform human BJ - TERT cells into growth on soft agar ( data not shown ) . MCV sT - induced cell transformation was independent of PP2A and heat shock protein binding . SV40 sT antigen primarily contributes to cell transformation via targeting of the protein phosphatase PP2A by binding the A α subunit ( 20 , 34 ) . We found that wild - type MCV sT could also be immunoprecipitated by tagged PP2A A α ( Figure 4E ) . To examine PP2A’s role in MCV sT – induced cell transforma - tion , we generated MCV sT mutants with alanine substitutions at 6 residues that are conserved with known SV40 sT PP2A interac - tion sites ( 35 ) . Of the 6 mutations , 4 were unsuitable for additional analysis : alanine substitutions at residue histidine 130 or at a previ - Figure 2 MCV sT antigen protein is commonly expressed in MCC .

R7A ) or leucine 142 ( sT . L142A ) , were expressed at levels comparable to the wild - type MCV sT protein ( Figure 4D ) , but did not interact with PP2A A α ( Figure 4E ) . The L142A substitution also prevented MCV sT interac - tion with PP2A subunit C , whereas R7A did not ( data not shown ) . Lentiviruses expressing the sT . R7A and sT . L142A proteins had equal or greater efficiency compared with the wild - type sT protein in inducing Rat - 1 cell focus formation ( 46 and 36 foci , respectively , per 60 - mm dish ; Figure 4A ) and anchorage - independent colony formation ( Figure 4C ) . We also examined an sT aspartate - to - aspar - agine substitution in the exon 1 – encoded DnaJ domain , sT . D44N , that eliminates Hsc70 binding to MCV LT ( 14 ) . The MCV sT pro - tein with this substitution was expressed ( Figure 4D ) and retained rodent cell transformation efficiency similar to that of the wild - type protein ( Figure 4 , A and C ) . For Rat - 1 cells , expression of either sT . R7A or sT . L142A proteins accelerated rodent cell growth similarly to the wild - type sT protein ( Supplemental Figure 3D ) . For human BJ - TERT cells grown in 10 % FCS ( only sT . L142A was examined ) , both wild - type and PP2A - bind - ing mutant showed accelerated cell growth compared with cells without sT expression ( Figure 5A ) . BJ - TERT cell mitogenesis with sT . L142A was not significantly reduced compared with wild - type sT for cells grown at 0 % FCS . Flow cytometry showed that both sT and sT . L142A initiated increased BJ - TERT cell cycle transit , com - parable to the empty vector , under serum - free and serum - complete conditions ( Figure 5B ) . Thus , PP2A interaction is not required for MCV sT to initiate rodent cell transformation or serum - indepen - dent human cell proliferation . MCV sT promotes 4E - BP1 hyperphosphorylation . SV40 sT protein contributes to cell transformation by inhibiting PP2A - dependent Akt dephosphorylation ( 21 , 22 ) . To determine whether MCV sT – induced cell proliferation is also dependent on Akt - mTOR signal - ing , we examined a downstream target for this pathway , 4E - BP1 Figure 3 MCV sT expression is required for growth , but not survival , of MCV - positive MCC cells .

Pulldown of sT protein was detected using anti - sT antibody ( CM5E1 ) . research article 3628 The Journal of Clinical Investigation http : / / www . jci . org Volume 121 Number 9 September 2011 ( Figure 1 ) . As shown in Figure 6A , MCV sT increased 4E - BP1 hyper - phosphorylation at S65 ( especially for the δ form ) in 293 cells but did not markedly change basal phosphorylation ( α or β forms , T37 / T46 ) . MCV sT expression did not measurably affect raptor expres - sion levels . Long - term raptor ( mTORC1 ) knockdown by selection with a raptor - specific shRNA prevented MCV sT – promoted 4E - BP1 S65 δ phosphorylation ( Figure 6A ) . MCV sT only increased steady - state 4E - BP1 phosphorylation once 4E - BP1 was phosphorylated by mTORC1 , which suggests it may prevent turnover of hyperphos - phorylated 4E - BP1 . mTOR inhibitor studies provided direct evidence in support of this suggestion . Short - term treatment of 293 cells with the mTORC1 - specific inhibitor rapamycin resulted in rapid turnover of the hyperphosphorylated 4E - BP1 phospho - S65 γ form ( Figure 6B ) . Although rapa sortmycin is not a potent inhibitor of 4E - BP1 phosphorylation , the 4E - BP1 phospho - S65 γ form was nearly absent within 15 minutes of the start of rapamycin treatment . MCV sT expression , however , prevented turnover of phospho - S65 for up to 1 hour after treatment ( Figure 6B ) . In contrast to S65 phosphorylation , rapamycin treatment or MCV sT expression did not appreciably alter basal T37 / T46 phosphorylation . Treatment with 2 different active site mTORC1 / mTORC2 inhibitors , PP242 ( 36 ) or Torin1 ( 37 ) , for 6 hours also resulted in loss of steady - state S65 hyperphosphorylation ( Figure 6C ) . Unlike rapamycin treatment , basal T37 / T46 phosphorylation was nearly abolished after PP242 or Torin1 treatment . When MCV sT was expressed in cells and treated with either PP242 or Torin1 , the 4E - BP1 δ form ( but not γ form ) phospho - S65 ( 32 ) was mainly pre - served ( Figure 6C ) . Taken together , these data confirmed mTORC1 to be the major kinase hyperphosphorylating 4E - BP1 in the δ form at S65 . Phosphorylation was rapidly lost when mTORC1 was inhibited , yet was preserved by expression of MCV sT . To determine whether MCV sT targeting of the phosphatase PP2A is involved in preserving 4E - BP1 hyperphosphorylation ( 38 ) , we examined the sT . R7A and sT . L142A proteins in 293 cells in the presence or absence of rapamycin for 1 hour . Both of the PP2A - binding defective sT proteins increased steady - state 4E - BP1 hyperphosphorylation comparable to wild - type MCV sT and were equally resistant to rapamycin ( Figure 6D ) . These data indicate that PP2A targeting is not required for sT - promoted 4E - BP1 hyperphosphorylation . The effects of MCV sT on 4E - BP1 hyperphosphorylation were confirmed in native MCC cell lines . Both MCV sT and pan - T1 knockdown decreased expression of phosphorylated 4E - BP1 , particularly hyperphosphorylated forms , in MKL - 1 cells but not in UISO cells ( Figure 7A ) . Similar results were seen for 3 other MCV - positive cell lines ( Supplemental Figure 4A ) . Func - tional consequences of sT - induced 4E - BP1 hyperphosphoryla - tion were examined using a 7mGTP pulldown assay . Knock - down of either pan - T1 or sT1 in MKL - 1 cells decreased eIF4G binding to 7mGTP - resin , comparable to positive control PP242 treatment ( Figure 7B ) . PP242 reduced both eIF4G and eIF4E binding to 7mGTP , and we were unable to determine whether differences between shRNA knockdown and PP242 treatment on eIF4E cap - binding are due to a partial knockdown effect or reflect other biological relevance . Figure 5 MCV sT promotes serum - independent human BJ - TERT cell proliferation . ( A ) sT protein was trans - duced by lentiviral vector into immortalized BJ - TERT cells , and cell proliferation was determined in 10 % FCS or no serum using a Wst - 1 colorimetric cell proliferation assay . sT accelerated BJ - TERT cell growth in the presence of serum and prevented proliferation arrest in the absence of serum ( normal - ized by mean OD values on day 1 for 2 independent experiments performed in triplicate ) . Mutation of the sT binding site to PP2A ( sT . L142A ) retained cell proliferation in both the presence and the absence of serum . ( B ) Cell cycle profiles for BJ - TERT cells expressing sT antigens in 0 % and 10 % FCS . In the absence of serum , greater than 95 % of BJ - TERT cells transduced with the empty vector arrested in G 1 , whereas substantial fractions of cells express - ing wild - type sT ( 7 % ) or sT . L142A ( 11 % ) continued to transit through the cell cycle . research article The Journal of Clinical Investigation http : / / www . jci . org Volume 121 Number 9 September 2011 3629 Effect of MCV sT on other Akt - mTOR pathway proteins . In addition to 4E - BP1 , S6K is also an mTORC1 kinase target ( 39 ) . MCV sT markedly increased steady - state T421 / S424 phosphorylation of pp70 S6K in 293 cells ( Figure 8A ) . Rapamycin treatment for 1 hour markedly reduced S6K phosphorylation , which was inhib - ited by sT expression . However , MCV sT preservation of the S6K phospho - T389 form after rapamycin treatment was much reduced compared with phospho - T421 / S424 . Mutation of PP2A binding Figure 6 MCV sT promotes 4E - BP1 S65 hyperphosphorylation and cap - dependent translation . ( A ) MCV sT promoted δ 4E - BP1 hyperphosphorylation at S65 ; this phosphorylation was mediated by mTORC1 and could be inhibited by long - term raptor knockdown . 293 cells were stably transduced with Raptor shRNA lentivirus ( shRap ) and transfected with sT or empty vector on day 5 after transduction . ( B ) MCV sT prevented loss of hyper - phosphorylated 4E - BP1 S65 during short - term mTORC1 inhibition with rapamycin . 293 cells transfected with empty vector or MCV sT were treated with 50 nM rapamycin for up to 1 hour . Basal phosphorylation at T37 and T46 was unaffected by rapamycin treatment or sT expression . ( C ) MCV sT prevented loss of 4E - BP1 during short - term mTORC1 and mTORC2 inhibition with Torin1 and PP242 . 293 cells , with or without sT expression , were treated with Torin1 ( 500 nM ) or PP242 ( 5 μ M ) for 6 hours . 4E - BP1 was almost completely dephosphorylated after drug treatment in the absence of sT expression . When sT was expressed , the δ S65 form was preserved . ( D ) Both wild - type sT and PP2A - binding sT mutants promoted rapamycin - resistant 4E - BP1 phosphorylation in 293 cells treated with 50 nM rapamycin for 1 hour . research article 3630 The Journal of Clinical Investigation http : / / www . jci . org Volume 121 Number 9 September 2011 sites in sT had no effect on its promotion of S6K phosphorylation . S6K’s downstream target , S6 , showed parallel changes in phos - phorylation when MCV sT was expressed ( Figure 8A ) . sT knock - down in native MKL - 1 cells confirmed these findings ( Supplemen - tal Figure 4B ) . 4E - BP2 , for which phospho - specific antibodies are unavailable , also showed a gel shift in the presence of MCV sT . Like 4E - BP1 hyperphosphorylation and S6K phosphorylation , 4E - BP2 phosphorylation was relatively resistant to rapamycin treatment and was not dependent on sT binding to PP2A ( Figure 8A ) . To examine the effects of MCV sT on upstream Akt ( Figure 1 ) , Akt phospho - S473 was examined in the absence and presence of MCV sT in 293 cells ( Figure 8B ) . No differences in Akt phosphory - lation were apparent . PP242 and Torin1 treatment abolished S473 phosphorylation , regardless of MCV sT expression . Furthermore , neither sT . R7A nor sT . L142A PP2A - binding mutants affected Akt S473 phosphorylation ( Figure 8C ) . In MKL - 1 cells , Akt was active , as measured by S473 phosphorylation ( Figure 8D ) . Treatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or the Akt inhibitor MK2206 dimin - ished S473 phosphorylation . T antigen knockdown increased Akt phosphorylation , although this was more pronounced by pan – T antigen knockdown than by knockdown of sT alone . These results indicate that although MCV sT bound some PP2A isoforms ( Figure 4E ) , Akt does not appear to be activated by MCV sT inter - action with PP2A , unlike SV40 sT ( 21 , 22 ) . 4E - BP1 hyperphosphorylation is required for MCV sT – induced cell trans - formation . We expressed sT together with either wild - type 4E - BP1 or 4E - BP1AA ( 40 ) in Rat - 1 cells and assayed transformation by soft agar assays . 4E - BP1AA is a constitutively active 4E - BP1 with ala - nine substitutions at the priming T37 and T46 phosphorylation sites . 10 microscopic fields were assessed for each condition by an investigator blinded to the expression conditions . As was previously found ( Figure 4C ) , Rat - 1 cells expressing MCV sT reproducibly formed numerous large , multicellular colonies after 3 weeks of growth in soft agar ( Figure 9 , A and B ) . When 4E - BP1 was coexpressed , large colony counts per field were reduced greater than 50 % . Large colonies were nearly absent when 4E - BP1AA was expressed together with MCV sT , with most cells remaining as single cells or consisting of clumps of few and scat - tered cells ( Figure 9 , A and B ) . Neither 4E - BP1 nor 4E - BP1AA affected cell viability ( data not shown ) . Discussion MCV sT induces loss of contact inhibition , anchorage - indepen - dent growth , and serum - independent growth . It is expressed in nearly all MCV - positive MCC tumors and required for the proliferation of MCC tumor cells . MCV sT is an oncoprotein in humans and has potential for use as a diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for MCC . MCV is related to SV40 and shares similar gene structures , but these 2 viruses differ in their carcinogenic mechanisms . SV40 LT induces cell transformation , whereas MCV LT does not . MCV sT alone is sufficient to cause transformation in rodent cell assays , but this is not the case for SV40 . PP2A interaction is critical for SV40 sT and murine polyomavirus sT – and middle T – induced pro - liferation ( 8 , 18 , 19 , 41 , 42 ) , but PP2A interaction can be abolished in MCV sT without affecting rodent cell transformation , human cell serum – independent growth , or 4E - BP1 phosphorylation . The mechanism of MCV sT maintenance of 4E - BP1 hyper - phosphorylation may provide new insights into Akt - mTOR signaling . Determining how MCV sT does this can only remain speculative until its cellular partners have been more fully described . MCV sT has no recognizable kinase domains and it acts on phosphorylation sites in both 4E - BP1 and S6K , the prox - imal substrates for mTORC1 kinase . MCV sT preserved 4E - BP1 hyperphosphorylation , particularly of the phospho - S65 δ form ; our raptor knockdown revealed that mTORC1 must be active for MCV sT to achieve this effect . It is unlikely , for example , for sT to activate a non - mTORC1 kinase to phosphorylate 4E - BP1 . Figure 7 MCV sT knockdown in MCV - infected MCC cells reduces 4E - BP1 hyperphosphorylation and inactivates cap - dependent translation initiation complex formation . ( A ) sT and pan - T antigen knockdown reduced 4E - BP1 γ S65 hyperphosphorylation in MCV - positive MKL - 1 cells , but not MCV - negative UISO cells . Priming site T37 / T46 phosphorylation was preserved after sT antigen knockdown , whereas secondary sites of phos - phorylation ( S65 and T70 ) were markedly reduced . ( B ) Knockdown of either pan - T antigen or sT ( by pan - T1 or sT1 , respectively ) in MKL - 1 cells inhibited eIF4G binding to 7mGTP sepharose beads in parallel with loss of 4E - BP1 S65 phosphorylation . Control shRNA – infected MKL - 1 cells treated with PP242 are shown as a positive control . Despite partial preservation of 4E - BP1 phospho - S65 ( arrowhead ) in MKL - 1 cells , eIF4E and eIF4G binding was reduced after PP242 treatment . Lanes were run on the same gel but were noncontiguous ( white lines ) . research article The Journal of Clinical Investigation http : / / www . jci . org Volume 121 Number 9 September 2011 3631 Hyperphosphorylated forms of 4E - BP1 , however , demonstrated quick turnover when cells were treated with mTOR inhibitors , and this turnover was prevented by MCV sT expression ( Figure 6C ) . It is therefore also unlikely that MCV sT activates mTOR complex kinase activity . We do not find a direct interaction between MCV sT and mTOR or 4E - BP1 by coimmunoprecipita - tion experiments ( data not shown ) . Our results point toward MCV sT inhibiting 4E - BP1 dephos - phorylation or turnover and so elevating steady - state levels of hyperphosphorylated 4E - BP1 ( Figure 10 ) . Experiments using Torin1 and PP242 suggested that MCV sT preferentially pre - serves 4E - BP1 S65 phosphorylation , even when other 4E - BP1 sites are dephosphorylated . We are unaware of a phosphatase or other metabolic protein that regulates both 4E - BP1 and S6K , and so identifying the cellular partner for MCV sT may more generally help to explain how Akt - mTOR signaling is normally turned off . PP2A cannot be responsible for this effect , since PP2A - binding mutations did not affect steady - state 4E - BP1 levels induced by MCV sT . Our results indicate that deregulated cap - dependent trans - lation through 4E - BP1 hyperphosphorylation may contribute to Merkel cell carcinogenesis . Constitutively active 4E - BP1 that cannot be inactivated by MCV sT prevented sT - induced cell transformation . Whether increased phosphorylation of S6K and other 4E - BP proteins by MCV sT is also required for transformation remains to be examined . These findings have potential therapeutic implications . Akt - mTOR activation is common for other tumor viruses that target upstream compo - nents of the Akt - mTOR signaling cascade ( 43 ) and are highly sensitive to mTOR inhibitors ( 44 ) . MCV sT , in contrast , was active downstream of mTOR . Consistent with this , rapamycin had little activity on MCC cell line survival or proliferation at micromolar concentrations ( R . Arora , Y . Chang , and P . S . Moore , unpublished observations ) . Although MCV sT is necessary for MCC , it is not the only viral factor sufficient to cause the tumor . Loss of sT expression does not fully recapitulate pan – T antigen knockdown ( 15 ) , and MCV sT did not induce full human BJ cell transformation . We found that LT did promote cell proliferation , and in the setting of human tumors , MCV sT was likely to act in combination with other MCV T antigens , immune suppression , and possibly host cell mutations to promote MCC outgrowth . Viral tumorigenesis is an uncommon , incidental , and acciden - tal consequence of viral infection , and so sT targeting of 4E - BP1 must promote the replication fitness of nontumorigenic MCV . Viruses commonly induce cap - dependent translation through Akt - mTOR manipulation ( 17 ) . Adenovirus , for example , activates Akt - mTOR signaling to induce 4E - BP1 phosphorylation early in infection ( 45 ) , and human herpesviruses , including Kaposi sarco - ma – associated herpesvirus ( 46 ) , herpes simplex 1 ( 40 ) , and cyto - megalovirus ( 47 ) , induce 4E - BP1 phosphorylation during lytic cycle initiation . MCV sT may similarly target 4E - BP1 to augment viral replication and transmission ( 48 ) , but in doing so , it places the infected cell at risk for carcinogenic transformation ( 49 ) . Figure 8 sT promotes steady - state phosphorylation of other mTORC1 downstream molecules . ( A ) sT and PP2A - binding mutants of MCV sT ( sT . R7A and sT . L142A ) increased steady - state phosphorylation of the S6K kinase at amino acid T389 and T421 / S424 , its S6 ribosomal protein substrate at S235 / S236 , and the 4E - BP2 protein ( arrowheads ) . Phosphorylation promoted by sT was relatively resistant to 1 hour rapamycin treatment , except at the S6K T389 site . α - Tubulin was used as a loading control . ( B ) sT , sT . R7A , and sT . L142A did not promote S473 Akt phosphorylation . sT did not prevent PP242 or Torin1 from blocking mTOR - dependent Akt phosphorylation . ( C ) PP2A targeting by MCV sT did not promote Akt phosphorylation . ( D ) MKL - 1 cells were transduced with sT1 , pan - T , or scrambled shRNA vector lentiviruses for 6 days , and then cell lysates were harvested for immunoblotting . The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and the Akt inhibitor MK2206 were used as positive controls to show constitutive Akt activity in MKL - 1 cells . Akt phosphorylation was increased by both pan - T1 shRNA and sT1 shRNA knockdown . research article 3632 The Journal of Clinical Investigation http : / / www . jci . org Volume 121 Number 9 September 2011 Methods Further information can be found in Supplemental Methods .
