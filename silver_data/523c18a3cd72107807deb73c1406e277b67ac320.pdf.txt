Large DNA loops that encompass genes and their regulatory el - ements depend on CTCF - CTCF interactions , but most enhancer - promoter interactions do not employ this structural protein . Here , we show that the ubiqui - tously expressed transcription factor Yin Yang 1 ( YY1 ) contributes to enhancer - promoter structural interactions in a manner analogous to DNA interac - tions mediated by CTCF . YY1 binds to active en - hancers and promoter - proximal elements and forms dimers that facilitate the interaction of these DNA el - ements . Deletion of YY1 binding sites or depletion of YY1 protein disrupts enhancer - promoter looping and gene expression . We propose that YY1 - mediated enhancer - promoter interactions are a general feature of mammalian gene control . INTRODUCTION Cell - type - speciﬁc gene expression programs in humans are generally controlled by gene regulatory elements called en - hancers ( Buecker and Wysocka , 2012 ; Bulger and Groudine , 2011 ; Levine et al . , 2014 ; Ong and Corces , 2011 ; Ren and Yue , 2015 ) . Transcription factors ( TFs ) bind these enhancer elements and regulate transcription from the promoters of nearby or distant genes through physical contacts that involve looping of DNA between enhancers and promoters ( Bonev and Cavalli , 2016 ; Fraser et al . , 2015 ; Heard and Bickmore , 2007 ; de Laat and Duboule , 2013 ; Pombo and Dillon , 2015 ; Spitz , 2016 ) . Despite the fundamental importance of proper gene control to cell identity and development , the proteins that contribute to structural interactions between enhancers and promoters are poorly understood . There is considerable evidence that enhancer - promoter inter - actions can be facilitated by transcriptional cofactors such as Mediator , structural maintenance of chromosomes ( SMC ) pro - tein complexes such as cohesin , and DNA binding proteins such as CTCF . Mediator can physically bridge enhancer - bound transcription factors and the promoter - bound transcription apparatus ( Allen and Taatjes , 2015 ; Jeronimo et al . , 2016 ; Kagey et al . , 2010 ; Malik and Roeder , 2010 ; Petrenko et al . , 2016 ) . Cohesin is loaded at active enhancers and promoters by the Mediator - associated protein NIPBL and may transiently stabilize enhancer - promoter interactions ( Kagey et al . , 2010 ; Schmidt et al . , 2010 ) . CTCF proteins bound at enhancers and promoters can interact with one another and may thus facilitate enhancer - promoter interactions ( Guo et al . , 2015 ; Splinter et al . , 2006 ) , but CTCF does not generally occupy these interacting elements ( Cuddapah et al . , 2009 ; Kim et al . , 2007 ; Phillips - Cremins et al . , 2013 ; Wendt et al . , 2008 ) . Enhancer - promoter interactions generally occur within larger chromosomal loop structures formed by the interaction of CTCF proteins bound to each of the loop anchors ( Gibcus and Dekker , 2013 ; Gorkin et al . , 2014 ; Hnisz et al . , 2016a ; Mer - kenschlager and Nora , 2016 ) . These loop structures , variously called topologically associating domains ( TADs ) , loop domains , CTCF contact domains and insulated neighborhoods , tend to insulate enhancers and genes within the CTCF - CTCF loops from elements outside those loops ( Dixon et al . , 2012 ; Dowen et al . , 2014 ; Hnisz et al . , 2016b ; Ji et al . , 2016 ; Lupia´n ˜ ez et al . , 2015 ; Narendra et al . , 2015 ; Nora et al . , 2012 ; Phillips - Cremins et al . , 2013 ; Rao et al . , 2014 ; Tang et al . , 2015 ) . Constraining DNA interactions within CTCF - CTCF loop structures in this manner may facilitate proper enhancer - promoter contacts .

( legend continued on next page ) 1574 Cell 172 , 1573 – 1588 , December 14 , 2017 Evidence that CTCF - CTCF interactions play important global roles in chromosome loop structures but are only occasionally directly involved in enhancer - promoter contacts ( Phillips and Corces , 2009 ) led us to consider the possibility that a bridging protein analogous to CTCF might generally participate in enhancer - promoter interactions . We report here that Yin Yang 1 ( YY1 ) contributes to enhancer - promoter interactions in a manner analogous to DNA looping mediated by CTCF . YY1 and CTCF share many features : both are essential , ubiquitously expressed , zinc - coordinating proteins that bind hypo - methyl - ated DNA sequences , form homodimers , and thus facilitate loop formation . The two proteins differ in that YY1 preferentially occupies interacting enhancers and promoters , whereas CTCF preferentially occupies sites distal from these regulatory ele - ments that tend to form larger loops and participate in insulation . Deletion of YY1 binding sites or depletion of YY1 can disrupt enhancer - promoter contacts and normal gene expression . Thus , YY1 - mediated structuring of enhancer - promoter loops is analogous to CTCF - mediated structuring of TADs , CTCF con - tact domains , and insulated neighborhoods . This model of YY1 - mediated structuring of enhancer - promoter loops accounts for diverse functions reported previously for YY1 , including con - tributions to both gene activation and repression and to gene dysregulation in cancer . RESULTS A Candidate Enhancer - Promoter Structuring Factor in Embryonic Stem Cells We sought to identify a protein factor that might contribute to enhancer - promoter interactions in a manner analogous to that of CTCF at insulators . Such a protein would be expected to bind active enhancers and promoters , be essential for cell viability , show ubiquitous expression , and be capable of dimer - ization . To identify proteins that bind active enhancers and promoters , we sought candidates from chromatin immunopre - cipitation with mass spectrometry ( ChIP - MS ) , using antibodies directed toward histones with modiﬁcations characteristic of enhancer and promoter chromatin ( H3K27ac and H3K4me3 , respectively ) ( Creyghton et al . , 2010 ) , conducted previously in murine embryonic stem cells ( mESCs ) ( Ji et al . , 2015 ) . Of 26 tran - scription factors that occupy both enhancers and promoters ( Figure 1A ) , four ( CTCF , YY1 , NRF1 , and ZBTB11 ) are essential based on a CRISPR cell - essentiality screen ( Figure 1B ) ( Wang et al . , 2015 ) and two ( CTCF , YY1 ) are expressed in > 90 % of tissues examined ( Figure 1C ) . YY1 and CTCF share additional features : like CTCF , YY1 is a zinc - ﬁnger transcription factor ( Kle - nova et al . , 1993 ; Shi et al . , 1991 ) , essential for embryonic and adult cell viability ( Donohoe et al . , 1999 ; Heath et al . , 2008 ) and capable of forming homodimers ( Lo´pez - Perrote et al . , 2014 ; Sal - dan˜a - Meyer et al . , 2014 ) ( Table S1 ) . YY1 , however , tends to occupy active enhancers and promoters , as well as some insu - lators , whereas CTCF preferentially occupies insulator elements ( Figures 1D and S1A – S1C ) . If YY1 contributes to enhancer - promoter interactions , then chromatin interaction analysis by paired - end tag sequencing ( ChIA - PET ) ( Fullwood et al . , 2009 ) for YY1 should show that YY1 is preferentially associated with these interactions . CTCF ChIA - PET , in contrast , should show that CTCF is preferentially associated with insulator DNA interactions . We generated ChIA - PET data for YY1 and CTCF in mESCs and compared these two datasets . The results showed that the majority of YY1 - associated interactions connect active regulatory elements ( enhancer - enhancer , enhancer - promoter , and promoter - pro - moter , which we will henceforth call enhancer - promoter interac - tions ) , whereas the majority of CTCF - associated interactions connect insulator elements ( Figures 1E and S1D ) . Some YY1 - YY1 interactions involved simple enhancer - promoter contacts , as seen in the Raf1 locus ( Figure 1F ) , and others involved more complex contacts among super - enhancer constituents and their target promoters , as seen in the Klf9 locus ( Figure S1E ) . Super - enhancers were generally occupied by YY1 at relatively high densities and exhibited relatively high YY1 - YY1 interaction fre - quencies ( Figures S1E – S1H ) . For both YY1 and CTCF , there was also evidence of enhancer - insulator and promoter - insulator interactions , but these were more pronounced for CTCF ( Figure S1D ) . Previous studies have reported that YY1 can form dimers ( Lo´pez - Perrote et al . , 2014 ) . To conﬁrm that YY1 dimerization occurs , FLAG - tagged and HA - tagged versions of YY1 protein were expressed in cells , nuclei were isolated and the tagged YY1 proteins in nuclear extracts were immunoprecipitated with either anti - FLAG or anti - HA antibodies . The results show that the FLAG - tagged and HA - tagged YY1 proteins interact ( Figures 1G , 1H , S1I , and S1J ) , consistent with prior reports that YY1 pro - teins oligomerize ( Lo´pez - Perrote et al . , 2014 ) . Other highly ex - pressed nuclear proteins such as OCT4 did not co - precipitate , indicating that the assay was speciﬁc ( Figure S1J ) . We previously reported that YY1 can bind both DNA and RNA independently , and that YY1 binding of active regulatory DNA elements is enhanced by the binding of RNA species that are transcribed at these loci ( Sigova et al . , 2015 ) . It is therefore possible that YY1 - YY1 interactions may be enhanced by the ability of each of the YY1 proteins to bind RNA species .

( legend continued on next page ) 1576 Cell 172 , 1573 – 1588 , December 14 , 2017 was treated with RNase A prior to immunoprecipitation with anti - tag antibodies , there was an (cid:3) 60 % reduction in the amount of co - immunoprecipitated YY1 partner protein ( Figures 1G and 1H ) . These results suggest that stable YY1 - YY1 interactions may be facilitated by RNA . YY1 Generally Occupies Enhancers and Promoters in Mammalian Cells YY1 is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian cells , so we investigated whether YY1 generally occupies enhancers and promoters in a broad spectrum of mammalian cell types . Exam - ination of sites bound by YY1 across human cell types showed that YY1 does generally occupy enhancers and promoters genome - wide , and , as expected , enhancer occupancy tends to be cell type speciﬁc ( Figures 2A , 2B , and S2A – S2F ) . As with mESCs , YY1 was also found at a subset of insulators in the human cells ( Figures S2A – S2F ) . Examination of YY1 ChIP sequencing ( ChIP - seq ) data in multiple murine cell types conﬁrmed that YY1 generally occupies enhancers and pro - moters and is present at some insulators ( Figures S2G – S2J ) . These results indicate that YY1 generally occupies enhancer and promoter elements in mammalian cells . To determine whether YY1 is associated with sites of enhancer - promoter interactions in human cells , we conducted YY1 HiChIP experiments ( Mumbach et al . , 2016 ) in three different cell types . These experiments revealed that YY1 is pre - dominantly associated with enhancer - promoter interactions ( Figures 2C – 2K ) . YY1 was also associated with some insulator - enhancer and insulator - promoter interactions , suggesting that the factor may also occasionally participate in such interactions ( Figures S2K – S2M ) . In summary , the HiChIP results indicate that YY1 generally occupies sites involved in enhancer - promoter in - teractions , and occasionally occupies sites of insulator interac - tions , in mammalian cells . YY1 Can Enhance DNA Interactions In Vitro CTCF proteins can form homodimers and larger oligomers and thus when bound to two different DNA sites can form a loop with the intervening DNA ( Saldan˜a - Meyer et al . , 2014 ) . The observation that YY1 is bound to interacting enhancers and promoters , coupled with the evidence that YY1 - YY1 interac - tions can occur in vitro and in cell extracts , is consistent with the idea that YY1 - YY1 interactions can contribute to loop for - mation between enhancers and promoters . To obtain evidence that YY1 can have a direct effect on DNA interactions , we used an in vitro DNA circularization assay to determine whether puri - ﬁed YY1 can enhance the rate of DNA interaction in vitro . The rate of DNA circularization catalyzed by T4 DNA ligase has been used previously to measure persistence length and other physical properties of DNA ( Shore et al . , 1981 ) . We reasoned that if YY1 bound to DNA is capable of dimerizing and thereby forming DNA loops , then incubating a linear DNA template con - taining YY1 binding sites with puriﬁed YY1 protein should bring the ends into proximity and increase the rate of circularization ( Figures 3A and 3D ) . Recombinant YY1 protein was puriﬁed and shown to have DNA binding activity using a mobility shift assay ( Figures S3A and S3B ) . This recombinant YY1 was then tested in the DNA circularization assay ; the results showed that YY1 increased the rate of circularization and that this de - pended on the presence of YY1 motifs in the DNA ( Figures 3B and 3C ) . The addition of an excess of a competing 200 - bp DNA fragment containing the YY1 consensus binding sequence abrogated circularization of the larger DNA molecule ( Figures 3D – 3F ) . The addition of bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) did not increase the rate of DNA ligation ( Figures 3C and 3F ) . These results support the idea that YY1 can directly facilitate DNA interactions . Enhancer - Promoter Interactions Depend on YY1 in Living Cells To test whether enhancer - promoter interactions in living cells depend on YY1 binding sites in these elements , a CRISPR / Cas9 system was used to generate a small deletion of a YY1 binding motif in the regulatory regions of two genes ( Figure 4A ) . Deletion of the optimal DNA - binding motif for YY1 in the pro - moter of the Raf1 gene resulted in decreased YY1 binding at the promoter , reduced contact frequency between the enhancer and promoter , and a decrease in Raf1 mRNA levels ( Figures 4B and S4A ) . Deletion of the optimal DNA - binding motif for YY1 in the promoter of the Etv4 gene also resulted in decreased YY1 binding and decreased enhancer - promoter contact frequency , although it did not signiﬁcantly affect the levels of Etv4 mRNA ( Figures 4C and S4B ) . These results suggest that the YY1 binding sites contribute to YY1 binding and enhancer - promoter contact frequencies at both Raf1 and Etv4 , although the reduction in looping frequencies at Etv4 was not sufﬁcient to have a signiﬁ - cant impact on Etv4 mRNA levels . The lack of an effect on Etv4 mRNA levels may be a consequence of the residual YY1 that is bound to the Etv4 promoter region , where additional CCAT motifs are observed ( Figure 4C ) . Indeed , when YY1 protein is depleted ( see below ; Figure S6E ) , the levels of both Raf1 and Etv4 mRNA decrease . Previous studies have reported that YY1 is an activator of some genes and a repressor of others , but a global analysis of YY1 dependencies has not been described with a complete depletion of YY1 in mESCs ( Gordon et al . , 2006 ; Shi et al . , 1997 ; Thomas and Seto , 1999 ) . We used an inducible degradation system ( Erb et al . , 2017 ; Huang et al . , 2017 ; Winter et al . , 2015 ) to fully deplete YY1 protein levels and measured the impact on gene expression in mESCs genome - wide through RNA sequencing ( RNA - seq ) analysis ( Figures 5A and 5B ) . Depletion of YY1 led to signiﬁcant ( adjusted p value < 0 . 05 ) changes in expression of 8 , 234 genes , divided almost equally between genes with increased expres - sion and genes with decreased expression ( Figure 5C ; Table S2 ; Table S3 ) . The genes that experienced the greatest ( F – K ) Examples of YY1 - YY1 enhancer - promoter interactions in three human cell types : colorectal cancer ( F and I ) , T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( G and J ) , and chronic myeloid leukemia ( H and K ) . Displayed examples show YY1 - YY1 enhancer - promoter interactions involving typical enhancers ( F – H ) and involving super - enhancers ( I – K ) . See also Figure S2 . See STAR Methods for detailed description of genomics analyses . Datasets used in this ﬁgure are listed in Table S4 . Cell 172 , 1573 – 1588 , December 14 , 2017 1577 changes in expression with YY1 depletion were generally occu - pied by YY1 ( Figure 5D ) . Previous studies have shown that YY1 is required for normal embryonic development ( Donohoe et al . , 1999 ) . We therefore investigated whether the loss of YY1 leads to defects in embry - onic stem cell ( ESC ) differentiation into the three germ layers ( Figure 5E ) . mESCs and isogenic cells that were subjected to inducible degradation of YY1 were stimulated to form embryoid bodies ( Figure 5F ) , and the cells in these bodies were subjected to immunohistochemistry staining and single - cell RNA - seq to monitor expression of differentiation - speciﬁc factors . The results showed that cells lacking YY1 showed pronounced defects in expression of the master transcription factors that drive normal differentiation ( Figures 5G , 5H , and S5 ) . We next investigated whether changes in DNA looping occur upon global depletion of YY1 in mESCs . HiChIP for H3K27ac , a histone modiﬁcation present at both enhancers and pro - moters , was performed before and after YY1 depletion to detect differences in enhancer - promoter interaction frequencies . Prior to YY1 depletion , the results of the HiChIP experiment showed interactions between the various elements that were similar to the earlier YY1 ChIA - PET results ( Figures S6A and S6B ) .

YY1 depletion , the interactions between YY1 - occupied enhancers and promoters decreased signiﬁcantly ( Figures 6A and 6B ) . The majority ( 60 % ) of genes con - nected by YY1 enhancer - promoter loops showed signiﬁcant changes in gene expression ( Figures 6C and S6D ) . Exami - nation of the HiChIP DNA interaction pro - ﬁles at speciﬁc genes conﬁrmed these effects . For example , with YY1 depletion the Slc7a5 promoter and its enhancer showed an (cid:3) 50 % reduction in interaction frequency , and Slc7a5 expression levels were reduced by (cid:3) 27 % ( Figure 6D ) . Simi - larly , after YY1 depletion the Klf9 promoter and its super - enhancer showed an (cid:3) 40 % reduction in interaction frequency , and Klf9 expression levels were reduced by (cid:3) 50 % ( Figure 6E ) . Rescue of Enhancer - Promoter Interactions in Cells The ability of an artiﬁcially tethered YY1 protein to rescue defects associated with a YY1 binding site mutation would be a strong test of the model that YY1 mediates enhancer - promoter interac - tions ( Figure 7A ) . We carried out such a test with a dCas9 - YY1 fusion protein targeted to a site adjacent to a YY1 binding site mutation in the promoter - proximal region of Etv4 ( Figures 7B and 7C ) . We found that artiﬁcially tethering YY1 protein to the promoter led to increased contact frequency between the Etv4 promoter and its enhancer and caused increased transcription from the gene ( Figure 7D ) . These results support the model that YY1 is directly involved in structuring enhancer - pro - moter loops . To more globally test whether YY1 can rescue the loss of enhancer - promoter interactions after YY1 degradation , we subjected mESCs to YY1 degradation with the dTAG method and then washed out the dTAG compound and allowed YY1 to be restored to normal levels ( Figures 7E , S7A , and S7B ) . Enhancer - promoter frequencies were monitored with 1578 Cell 172 , 1573 – 1588 , December 14 , 2017 H3K27ac HiChIP . Consistent with our previous experiment ( Figure 6 ) , the loss of YY1 caused a loss in enhancer - promoter interactions , but the recovery of YY1 levels was accompanied by a substantial increase in enhancer - promoter interactions ( Figure 7F ) . These results were comparable to the effects observed with the rescue of CTCF - CTCF interactions in a similar experiment described recently ( Figures 7F and S7C ) ( Nora et al . , 2017 ) , and support the model that YY1 contributes to structuring of a large fraction of enhancer - promoter loops genome - wide . DISCUSSION We describe here evidence that the transcription factor YY1 con - tributes to enhancer - promoter structural interactions . For a broad spectrum of genes , YY1 binds to active enhancers and promoters and is required for normal levels of enhancer - pro - moter interaction and gene transcription . YY1 is ubiquitously ex - pressed , occupies enhancers and promoters in all cell types examined , is associated with sites of DNA looping in cells where such studies have been conducted , and is essential B C A Figure 4 .

( B ) Change in normalized interactionfrequency ( log 2 fold change ) upon degradation of YY1 for three different classes of interactions : all interactions , interactions not associated with YY1 ChIP - seq peaks , and YY1 - YY1 enhancer - promoter interactions . ( legend continued on next page ) Cell 172 , 1573 – 1588 , December 14 , 2017 1581 for embryonic and adult cell viability , so it is likely that YY1 - medi - ated enhancer - promoter interactions are a general feature of mammalian gene control . Evidence that CTCF - CTCF interactions play important roles in chromosome loop structures but are only occasionally involved in enhancer - promoter interactions led us to consider the possi - bility that a bridging protein analogous to CTCF might generally participate in enhancer - promoter interactions . CTCF and YY1 share many features : they are DNA - binding zinc - ﬁnger factors ( Klenova et al . , 1993 ; Shi et al . , 1991 ) that selectively bind hypo - methylated DNA sequences ( Bell and Felsenfeld , 2000 ; Yin et al . , 2017 ) , are ubiquitously expressed ( Figure 1C ) ( Mele et al . , 2015 ) , are essential for embryonic viability ( Donohoe et al . , 1999 ; Heath et al . , 2008 ) , and are capable of dimerization ( Figures 1G , 1H , S1I , and S1J ) ( Lo´pez - Perrote et al . , 2014 ; Saldan˜a - Meyer et al . , 2014 ) . The two proteins differ in several important ways . CTCF - CTCF interactions occur predominantly between sites that can act as insulators and to a lesser degree between enhancers and promoters ( Figures 1E and S1A – S1D ) . YY1 - YY1 interactions occur predominantly between enhancers and promoters and to a lesser extent between insulators ( Figures 1E and S1A – S1D ) . At insulators , CTCF binds to a relatively large and conserved sequence motif ( when compared to those bound by other transcription factors ) ; these same sites tend to be bound in many different cell types , which may contribute to the observation that TAD boundaries tend to be preserved across cell types . At enhancers and promoters , YY1 binds to a relatively small and poorly conserved sequence motif within these regions , where RNA species are produced that can facilitate stable YY1 DNA binding ( Sigova et al . , 2015 ) . The cell - type - speciﬁc activity of enhancers and promoters thus contributes to the observation that YY1 - YY1 interactions tend to be cell type speciﬁc . The model that YY1 contributes to structuring of enhancer - promoter loops can account for the many diverse functions previously reported for YY1 , including activation and repression , differentiation , and cellular proliferation . For example , following its discovery in the early 1990s ( Hariharan et al . , 1991 ; Park and Atchison , 1991 ; Shi et al . , 1991 ) , YY1 was intensely studied and reported to act as a repressor for some genes and an acti - vator for others ; these context - speciﬁc effects have been attrib - uted to many different mechanisms ( reviewed in Gordon et al . , 2006 ; Shi et al . , 1997 ; Thomas and Seto , 1999 ) . There are many similar reports of context - speciﬁc activation and repres - sion by CTCF ( reviewed in Ohlsson et al . , 2001 ; Phillips and Corces , 2009 ) . Although it is reasonable to assume that YY1 and CTCF can act directly as activators or repressors at some genes , the evidence that these proteins contribute to structuring of DNA loops makes it likely that the diverse active and repres - sive roles that have been attributed to them are often a conse - quence of their roles in DNA structuring . In this model , the loss of CTCF or YY1 could have positive or negative effects due to other regulators that were no longer properly positioned to pro - duce their regulatory activities . Previous studies have hinted at a role for YY1 in long - distance DNA interactions . CTCF , YY1 , and cohesin have been implicated in the formation of DNA loops needed for V ( D ) J rearrangement at the immunoglobulin locus during B cell development ( Degner et al . , 2011 ; Guo et al . , 2011 ; Liu et al . , 2007 ) . B cell - speciﬁc dele - tion of YY1 causes a decrease in the contraction of the immuno - globulin H ( IgH ) locus , thought to be mediated by DNA loops , and a block in the development of B cells ( Liu et al . , 2007 ) . Knock - down of YY1 has also been shown to reduce intrachromosomal interactions between the Th2 locus control region ( LCR ) and the IL4 promoter ( Hwang et al . , 2013 ) . As this manuscript was completed , a paper appeared reporting that YY1 is present at the base of interactions between neuronal precursor cell - spe - ciﬁc enhancers and genes and that YY1 knockdown causes a loss of these interactions ( Beagan et al . , 2017 ) . The results described here argue that YY1 is more of a general structural regulator of enhancer - promoter interactions for a large popula - tion of genes , both cell type speciﬁc and otherwise , in all cells . Thus , the tendency of YY1 to be involved in cell - type - speciﬁc loops is a reﬂection of the cell - type speciﬁcity of enhancers and , consequently , their interactions with genes that can be ex - pressed in a cell - speciﬁc or a more general manner . YY1 plays an important role in human disease , YY1 haploin - sufﬁciency has been implicated in an intellectual disability syn - drome , and YY1 overexpression occurs in many cancers . A cohort of patients with various mutations in one allele and ex - hibiting intellectual disability have been described as having a ‘‘YY1 syndrome , ’’ and lymphoblastoid cell lines from these pa - tients show reduced occupancy of regulatory regions and small changes in gene expression at a subset of genes associated with YY1 binding ( Gabriele et al . , 2017 ) . These results are consistent with the model we describe for YY1 in global enhancer - promoter structuring , and with the idea that higher neurological functions are especially sensitive to such gene dysregulation . YY1 is overexpressed in a broad spectrum of tumor cells , and this overexpression has been proposed to cause unchecked cellular proliferation , tumorigenesis , metastatic potential , resistance to immune - mediated apoptotic stimuli , and resistance to chemo - therapeutics ( Gordon et al . , 2006 ; Zhang et al . , 2011 ) . The mech - anisms that have been reported to mediate these effects include YY1 - mediated downregulation of p53 activity , interference with poly - ADP - ribose polymerase , alteration in c - Myc and NF - k B expression , regulation of death genes and gene products , ( C ) Scatterplot displaying for each gene associated with a YY1 - YY1 enhancer - promoter interaction the change in gene expression ( log 2 fold change ) upon degradation of YY1 plotted against the expression in untreated cells .

Although it is possible that YY1 carries out all these functions , its role as a gen - eral enhancer - promoter structuring factor is a more parsimo - nious explanation of these pleiotropic phenotypes . Many zinc - coordinating transcription factors are capable of homo - and hetero - dimerization ( Amoutzias et al . , 2008 ; Lamb and McKnight , 1991 ) , and , because these comprise the largest class of transcription factors in mammals ( Weirauch and Hughes , 2011 ) , we suggest that a combination of cell - type - spe - ciﬁc and cell - ubiquitous transcription factors make a substantial and underappreciated contribution to enhancer - promoter loop structures . There are compelling studies of bacterial and bacte - riophage transcription factors that contribute to looping of regu - latory DNA elements through oligomerization ( Adhya , 1989 ; Schleif , 1992 ) , and reports of several eukaryotic factors with similar capabilities ( Matthews , 1992 ) . Nonetheless , most recent study of eukaryotic enhancer - promoter interactions has focused on cofactors that lack DNA binding capabilities and bridge enhancer - bound transcription factors and promoter - bound tran - scription apparatus ( Allen and Taatjes , 2015 ; Deng et al . , 2012 ; Jeronimo et al . , 2016 ; Kagey et al . , 2010 ; Malik and Roeder , 2010 ; Petrenko et al . , 2016 ) , with the notable exception of the proposals that some enhancer - promoter interactions are deter - mined by the nature of transcription factors bound at the two sites ( Muerdter and Stark , 2016 ) . We predict that future studies will reveal additional transcription factors that belong in the class of DNA binding proteins whose predominant role is to contribute to chromosome structure .

For the speciﬁc number of replicates done see either the ﬁgure legends or the speciﬁc section below . No aspect of the study was done blinded . Sample size was not predetermined and no outliers were excluded . Recombinant YY1 puriﬁcation and characterization YY1 puriﬁcation YY1 protein was puriﬁed using methods established by the Lee Lab ( Jeon and Lee , 2011 ) and previously described in ( Sigova et al . , 2015 ) . A plasmid containing N - terminal His6 - tagged human YY1 coding sequence ( a gift from Dr . Yang Shi ) was transformed into BL21 - CodonPlus ( DE3 ) - RIL cells ( Stratagene , 230245 ) . A fresh bacterial colony was inoculated into LB media containing ampicillin and chloramphenicol and grown overnight at 37 (cid:4) C . These bacteria were diluted 1 : 10 in 500 mL pre - warmed LB with ampicillin and chloramphenicol and grown for 1 . 5 hours at 37 (cid:4) C . After induction of YY1 expression with 1mM IPTG , cells were grown for another 5 hours , collected , and stored frozen at (cid:1) 80 (cid:4) C until ready to use . Cell 172 , 1573 – 1588 . e1 – e19 , December 14 , 2017 e3 Pellets from 500mL cells were resuspended in 15mL of Buffer A ( 6M GuHCl , 25mM Tris , 100mM NaCl , pH8 . 0 ) containing 10mM imidazole , 5mM b - mercaptoethanol , cOmplete protease inhibitors ( Roche , 11873580001 ) and sonicated ( ten cycles of 15 s on , 60 s off ) . The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 12 , 000 g for 30 minutes at 4 (cid:4) C and added to 1mL of Ni - NTA agarose ( Invitrogen , R901 - 15 ) pre - equilibrated with 10X volumes of Buffer A . Tubes containing this agarose lysate slurry were rotated at room tempera - ture for 1 hour . The slurry was poured into a column , and the packed agarose washed with 15 volumes of Buffer A containing 10mM imidazole . Protein was eluted with 4 X 2 mL Buffer A containing 500mM imidazole . Fractions were run out by SDS - PAGE gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue ( data not shown ) . Fractions containing protein of the correct size and high purity were combined and diluted 1 : 1 with elution buffer . DTT was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 100mM and incubated at 60 (cid:4) C for 30 minutes . The protein was refolded by dialysis against 2 changes of 1 Liter of 25mM Tris - HCl pH 8 . 5 , 100mM NaCl , 0 . 1mM ZnCl 2 , and 10mM DTT at 4 (cid:4) C followed by 1 change of the same dialysis buffer with 10 % glycerol . Protein was stored in aliquots at (cid:1) 80 (cid:4) C . YY1 characterization The purity of the recombinantYY1 was assessed by SDS - PAGE gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining and western blotting ( Figure S3A ) . The activity of the recombinant protein was assessed by EMSA ( Figure S3B ) . EMSA was performed using the LightShift Chemiluminescent EMSA Kit ( Thermo Scientiﬁc # 20148 ) following the manufacturer’s recommendations . Brieﬂy , recombinant protein was incubated with a biotinylated probe in the presence or absence of a cold competitor . Reactions were separated using a native gel and transferred to a membrane . Labeled DNA was detected using chemiluminescence . To generate the biotin labeled probe , 30 - nucleotide - long 5 0 biotinylated single stranded oligonucleotides ( IDT ) were annealed in 10 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 50 mM NaCl , and 1mM EDTA at a 50 uM concentration . The same protocol was used to generate the cold competitor . The probe was serially diluted to a concentration of 10 fmol / m L and cold competitor to a concentration of 2 pmol / m L . 2 m L of diluted probe and cold competitor were used for each binding reaction for a ﬁnal amount of 20 fmol labeled probe and 4 pmol cold competitor ( 200 fold excess ) in each reaction . Binding reactions were set - up in a 20 m L volume containing 1x Binding Buffer ( 10 mM Tris , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM DTT ; pH 7 . 5 ) , 2 . 5 % Glycerol , 5 mM MgCl 2 , 50 ng / m L Poly dI dC , 0 . 05 % NP - 40 0 . 1 mM ZnCl 2 , 10 mM HEPES , and 2 m g of recombinant YY1 protein . Bind - ing reactions were pre - incubated for 20 mins at room temperature with or without the cold competitor . Labeled probe was then added to binding reactions and incubated for 80 minutes at room temperature . After the 80 min incubation 5x Loading Buffer ( Thermo Scientiﬁc # 20148 ) was added to the reaction and run on a 4 % – 12 % TBE gel using 0 . 5x TBE at 40 mA for 2 . 5 hr at 4 (cid:4) C . The TBE gel was pre - run for 1 hr at 4 (cid:4) C . DNA was then electrophoretically transferred to a Biodyne B Nylon Membrane ( pre - soaked in cold 0 . 5x TBE for 10 mins ) at 380 mA for 30 mins at 4 (cid:4) C . The DNA was then crosslinked to the membrane by placing the membrane on a Dark Reader Transilluminator for 15 mins . The membrane was allowed to air dry at room temperature overnight and chemiluminescence detected the following day . Detection of biotin - labeled DNA was done as follows . The membrane was blocked for 20 mins using Blocking Buffer ( Thermo Scientiﬁc # 20148 ) . The membrane was then incubated in conjugate / blocking buffer ( Thermo Scientiﬁc # 20148 ) for 15 mins . The membrane was then washed four times with 1x Wash Buffer ( Thermo Scientiﬁc # 20148 ) for 5 mins . The membrane was then incu - bated in Substrate Equilibration Buffer ( Thermo Scientiﬁc # 20148 ) for 5 mins and then incubated in Substrate Working Solution ( Thermo Scientiﬁc # 20148 ) for 5 mins . The membrane was then imaged using a CCD camera using a 120 s exposure . All of these steps were performed at room temperature . Genome Editing The CRISPR / Cas9 system was used to genetically engineer ESC lines . Target - speciﬁc oligonucleotides were cloned into a plasmid carrying a codon - optimized version of Cas9 with GFP ( gift from R . Jaenisch ) . The oligos used for the cloning are included in Table S3 . The sequences of the DNA targeted ( the protospacer adjacent motif is underlined ) are listed below : For the motif deletions , ﬁve hundred thousand mES cells were transfected with 2 . 5 m g plasmid and sorted 48 hours later for the presence of GFP . Thirty thousand GFP - positive sorted cells were plated in a six - well plate in a 1 : 2 serial dilution ( ﬁrst well 15 , 000 cells , second well 7 , 500 cells , etc . ) . The cells were grown for approximately one week in 2i + LIF . Individual colonies were picked using a stereoscope into a 96 - well plate . Cells were expanded and genotyped by PCR and Sanger sequencing . Clones with deletions spanning the motif were further expanded and used for experiments .

YY1 . FKBP . knock - in . mCherry ) and 1 . 25 m g non - linearized repair plasmid 2 ( pAW63 . YY1 . FKBP . knock - in . BFP ) . Cells were sorted after 48 hours for the presence of GFP . Cells were expanded for ﬁve days and then sorted again for double positive mCherry and BFP cells . Thirty thousand mCherry + / BFP + sorted cells were plated in a six - well plate in a 1 : 2 serial dilution ( ﬁrst well 15 , 000 cells , second well 7 , 500 cells , etc ) . The cells were grown for approximately one week in 2i medium and then individual colonies were picked using a stereoscope into a 96 - well plate . Cells were expanded and genotyped by PCR ( YY1 _ gPCR _ 3F / 3R , Table S3 ) . Clones with a homozygous knock - in tag were further expanded and used for experiments . Chromatin Immunoprecipitation ( ChIP ) ChIP was performed as described in ( Lee et al . , 2006 ) with a few adaptations . mES cells were depleted of MEFs by splitting twice onto newly gelatinized plates without MEFs . Approximately 50 million mES cells were crosslinked for 15 minutes at room temperature by the addition of one - tenth volume of fresh 11 % formaldehyde solution ( 11 % formaldehyde , 50 mM HEPES pH 7 . 3 , 100 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA pH 8 . 0 , 0 . 5 mM EGTA pH 8 . 0 ) to the growth media followed by 5 min quenching with 125 mM glycine . Cells were rinsed twice with 1X PBS and harvested using a silicon scraper and ﬂash frozen in liquid nitrogen . Jurkat cells were crosslinked for 10 minutes in media at a concentration of 1 million cells / mL . Frozen crosslinked cells were stored at (cid:1) 80 (cid:4) C . 100 m l of Protein G Dynabeads ( Life Technologies # 10009D ) were washed 3X for 5 minutes with 0 . 5 % BSA ( w / v ) in PBS . Magnetic beads were bound with 10 m g of anti - YY1 antibody ( Santa Cruz , sc - 281X ) overnight at 4 (cid:4) C , and then washed 3X with 0 . 5 % BSA ( w / v ) in PBS . Cells were prepared for ChIP as follows . All buffers contained freshly prepared 1 3 cOmplete protease inhibitors ( Roche , 11873580001 ) . Frozen crosslinked cells were thawed on ice and then resuspended in lysis buffer I ( 50 mM HEPES - KOH , pH 7 . 5 , 140 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 10 % glycerol , 0 . 5 % NP - 40 , 0 . 25 % Triton X - 100 , 1 3 protease inhibitors ) and rotated for 10 minutes at 4 (cid:4) C , then spun at 1350 r cf . for 5 minutes at 4 (cid:4) C . The pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer II ( 10 mM Tris - HCl , pH 8 . 0 , 200 mM NaCl , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 mM EGTA , 1 3 protease inhibitors ) and rotated for 10 minutes at 4 (cid:4) C and spun at 1350 r cf . for 5 minutes at 4 (cid:4) C .

LCMS : 1077 . 35 ( M + H ) . In vitro DNA circularization assay First , two plasmids ( pAW49 , pAW79 ) were generated . pAW49 contains YY1 binding sites separated by (cid:3) 3 . 5 kb of intervening DNA . pAW79 is identical except it contains ﬁller DNA instead of the YY1 motifs . The intervening DNA was chosen based on looking at YY1 ChIP - seq and motif distribution in mES cells to identify regions that lacked YY1 occupancy and YY1 binding motifs . The YY1 binding motifs were chosen based on successful EMSAs ( Sigova et al . , 2015 ) . Approximately 200 bp of sequence was added between the binding motifs and the termini in order to provide ﬂexibility for the termini to ligate . The plasmid was built using Gibson assembly . Next , a PCR was run using plasmid as a template to generate a linear piece of DNA ( Table S5 ) . This PCR product was PCR puriﬁed ( QIAGEN 28104 ) and then digested with BamHI ( NEB R3136 ) and PCR puriﬁed . The BamHI digested template was used in the liga - tion assay . The ligation assay was carried out as follows . Reactions were prepared on ice in 66 m L with the following components : BSA control : 0 . 25 nM DNA , 1x T4 DNA ligase buffer ( NEB B0202S ) , H 2 O 0 . 12 m g / m L of BSA . Cell 172 , 1573 – 1588 . e1 – e19 , December 14 , 2017 e9 YY1 : 0 . 25 nM DNA , 1x T4 DNA ligase buffer ( NEB B0202S ) , H 2 O 0 . 12 m g / m L of YY1 . YY1 + competitor : 0 . 25 nM DNA , 1x T4 DNA ligase buffer ( NEB B0202S ) , H 2 O 0 . 12 m g / m L of YY1 , 100 nM competitor DNA ( Table S5 ) Assuming an extinction coefﬁcient for YY1 of 19940 M - 1 cm - 1 and 75 % purity , that gives an approximate YY1 molar concentration of (cid:3) 3 uM . Reactions were incubated at 20 (cid:4) C for 20 minutes to allow binding of YY1 to the DNA . For each time point 6 m L of the reaction was withdrawn and quenched in a total volume of 9 m L with a ﬁnal concentration of 30 mM EDTA , 1x NEB loading dye ( NEB , B7024S ) , 1 m g / m L of proteinase K , and heated at 65 (cid:4) C for 5 minutes . Time point 0 was taken and then 600 units of T4 DNA ligase ( NEB M0202 ) was added and the reaction was carried out at 20 (cid:4) C . Indicated time points were taken and then samples were run on a 4 % – 20 % TBE gradient gel for three hours at 120 V . The gel was stained with SYBR Gold ( Life Technologies S11494 ) and imaged with a CCD camera . Quantiﬁcation was done using Image Lab version 5 . 2 . 1 ( Bio - Rad Laboratories ) . First , band density of the starting product and liga - tion product were measured . Then the percent circularized was calculated : ( ligation product ) / ( ligation product + starting band ) * 100 . In Figure 3 to facilitate visualization overexposed gels are shown . For the quantiﬁcation exposures were used that did not have any overexposed pixels . Co - immunoprecipitation V6 . 5 mESCs were transfected with pcDNA3 _ FLAG _ YY1 and pcDNA3 _ FLAG _ HA using Lipofectamine 3000 ( Life Technologies # L3000001 ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Brieﬂy , cells were split and 8 million cells were plated onto a gelatinized 15 cm plate . 7 . 5 m g of each plasmid was mixed with 30 m L P3000 reagent and 75 m L Lipofectamine 3000 reagent ( Life Technologies # L3000001 ) in 1250 m L of DMEM ( Life technologies # 11995 - 073 ) . After (cid:3) 12 - 16 hours media was changed . Cells were harvested 48 hours after transfection by washing twice with ice - cold PBS and collected by scraping in ice - cold PBS . Harvested cells were centrifuged at 1 , 000 r cf . for 3 minutes to pellet cells . Supernatant was discarded and cell pellets were ﬂash frozen and stored at (cid:1) 80 (cid:4) C until ready to prepare nuclear extract . For each 15 cm plate of cells , frozen cell pellets were resuspended in 5 mL of ice - cold hypotonic lysis buffer ( 20 mM HEPES - KOH pH 7 . 5 , 20 % glycerol , 10 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 5 mM DTT and protease inhibitor ( Roche , 11697498001 ) ) and incubated on ice for 10 minutes to extract nuclei . Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 14 , 000 r cf . for 10 minutes at 4 (cid:4) C . Supernatant was discarded and nuclei were resuspended in 0 . 5 mL of ice - cold nuclear extraction buffer ( 20 mM HEPES - KOH pH 7 . 5 , 20 % glycerol , 250 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 . 5 mM MgCl 2 and protease inhibitor ) and incubated for 1 hour at 4 (cid:4) C with rotation . Lysates were clariﬁed by centrifugation at 14 , 000 r cf . for 10 minutes at 4 (cid:4) C . Nuclear extract , supernatant , was transferred to a new tube and diluted with 1 mL of ice - cold dilution buffer ( 20 mM HEPES - KOH pH 7 . 5 , 10 % glycerol , 100 mM NaCl , 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , 1 . 5 mM MgCl 2 , 0 . 2 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 mM DTT and protease inhibitor ) . Protein concentration of extracts was quantiﬁed by BCA assay ( Thermo Scientiﬁc , 23225 ) and protein concentration was adjusted to 400 m g / mL by addition of appropriate volume of 1 : 2 nuclear extraction buffer : dilution buffer . For RNase A - treated nuclear extract experiments , 250 m L of nuclear extract ( 100 m g ) was treated by addition of 7 . 5 m L of 33 mg / mL RNase A ( Sigma , R4642 ) or 18 . 75 m L of 20 U / m L SUPERase In RNase Inhibitor ( Invitrogen , AM2696 ) followed by incubation at 37 (cid:4) C for 10 minutes . For all experiments , an aliquot of extract was saved and stored at (cid:1) 80 (cid:4) C for use as an input sample after immunoprecipitation . To prepare beads for immunoprecipitation of FLAG - tagged and HA - tagged YY1 from nuclear extract , 50 m L of protein G magnetic beads per immunoprecipitation was washed three times with 1 mL of blocking buffer ( 0 . 5 % BSA in PBS ) , rotating for 5 minutes at 4 (cid:4) C for each wash . After separation on a magnet , beads were resuspended in 250 m L of blocking buffer . After addition of 5 m g of anti - FLAG ( Sigma , F7425 ) ) , anti - HA ( Abcam , ab9110 ) , or normal IgG ( Millipore , 12 - 370 ) antibody , beads were allowed to incubate for at least 1 hour at 4 (cid:4) C with rotation to bind antibody . After incubation , beads were washed three times with 1 mL of blocking buffer , rotating for 5 minutes at 4 (cid:4) C for each wash . Washed beads were separated on a magnet and the supernatant was discarded before resuspending in 250 m L of nuclear extract ( 100 m g ) . Beads were allowed to incubate with extract overnight at 4 (cid:4) C with rotation . The following morning , beads were washed ﬁve times with 1 mL of ice - cold wash buffer , rotating for 5 minutes at 4 (cid:4) C for each wash . Washed beads were resuspended in 100 m L of 1X XT sample buffer ( Biorad , 1610791 ) with 100 mM DTT and incubated at 95 (cid:4) C for 10 min . Beads were separated on a magnet and supernatant containing immunoprecipitated material was transferred to a new tube . To assay immunoprecipitation results by western blot , 10 m L of each samples was run on a 4 % – 20 % Bis - Tris gel ( Bio - rad , 3450124 ) using XT MOPS running buffer ( Bio - rad , 1610788 ) at 80 V for 20 minutes , followed by 150 V until dye front reached the end of the gel . Protein was then wet transferred to a 0 . 45 m m PVDF membrane ( Millipore , IPVH00010 ) in ice - cold transfer buffer ( 25 mM Tris , 192 mM glycine , 20 % methanol ) at 250 mA for 2 hours at 4 (cid:4) C . After transfer the membrane was blocked with 5 % non - fat milk in TBS for 1 hour at room temperature , shaking . Membrane was then incubated with 1 : 50 , 000 anti - FLAG - HRP ( Sigma , A8592 ) , 1 : 25 : 000 anti - HA - HRP ( Cell Signaling , 2999 ) , or anti - OCT3 / 4 ( C - 10 , Santa Cruz sc - 5279 ) 1 : 2000 antibody diluted in 5 % non - fat milk in TBST and incubated overnight at 4 (cid:4) C , with shaking . In the morning , the membrane was washed three times with TBST for 5 min at room temperature shaking for each wash . Membranes were developed with ECL substrate ( Thermo Scientiﬁc , 34080 ) and imaged using a CCD camera or exposed using ﬁlm . e10 Cell 172 , 1573 – 1588 . e1 – e19 , December 14 , 2017 Embryoid Body Formation Prior to differentiation , YY1 - FKBP tagged knock - in mESCs were cultured in serum + LIF on irradiated MEFs . Starting 48 hours prior to the differentiation and continuing throughout the entire experiment the YY1 - condition were exposed to 500 nM dTAG - 47 . 4 , 000 cells ( either YY1 - or YY1 + ) were then plated into each well of a 96 - well plate ( Nunclon Sphera , ThermoFisher ) in Embryoid Body formation media ( serum - LIF ) . Three plates were generated for each condition . The EBs were cultured in 96 - well plates for 4 days and then pooled and cultured in ultra - low attachment culture plates ( Costar , Corning ) . After three days , cells were harvested for single - cell RNA - seq ( day 7 of differentiation ) . Cells were harvested for single - cell RNA - seq by dissociation with Accutase for 30 minutes at 37 (cid:4) C . The cells were then resuspended in PBS with 0 . 04 % BSA and then prepared for sequencing ( see section on single - cell RNA - seq ) . Immunohistochemistry was performed after four days ( day 8 of differentiation ) . Immunohistochemistry Cells were ﬁxed in 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS and embedded in parafﬁn . Cells were sectioned and stained according to standard protocols using TUJI ( Biolegend 801201 , 1 : 1000 ) , GFAP ( Dako Z0344 , 1 : 200 ) , and Gata - 4 ( Abcam ab84593 1 : 100 ) primary antibodies and appropriate Alexa Fluor dye conjugated secondary antibodies ( 1 : 1000 , ThermoFisher ) and DAPI . Slides were mounted with Flu - oro - mount G ( Electron Microscopy Science ) and imaged using a Zeiss LSM 710 laser scanning confocal microscope . In all images scale bars are 50 m m . Single - cell RNA - seq library preparation Single - cell RNA - seq libraries were prepared using the Chromium Controller ( 10X Genomics ) . Brieﬂy , single cells in 0 . 04 % BSA in PBS were separated into droplets and then reverse transcription and library construction was performed according to the 10X Chromium Single Cell 3 0 Reagent Kit User Guide and sequenced on an Illumina Hi - seq 2500 . dCas9 - YY1 tethering First two lentiviral constructs were generated by modifying lenti dCAS - VP64 _ Blast ( lenti dCAS - VP64 _ Blast was a gift from Feng Zhang ( Addgene plasmid # 61425 ) ( Konermann et al . , 2015 ) ) . The VP64 was removed to generate dCas9 alone ( pAW91 ) or the human YY1 cDNA was inserted to the C terminus to generate dCas9 - YY1 ( pAW90 ) . For virus production , HEK293T cells grown to 50 % – 75 % conﬂuency on a 15 cm dish and then transfected with 15 m g of pAW90 or pAW91 , 11 . 25 m g psPAX ( Addgene 12260 ) , and 3 . 75 m g pMD2 . G ( Addgene 12259 ) . psPAX and pMD2 . G were kind gifts of Didier Trono . After 12 hours , media was replaced . Viral supernatant was collected 24 hours after media replacement ( 36 hr post transfec - tion ) and fresh media was added . Viral supernatant was collected again 48 hours after the media replacement ( 60 hours post trans - fection ) . Viral supernatant was cleared of cells by either centrifugation at 500 x g for 10 minutes . The virus was concentrated with Lenti - X concentrator ( Clontech 631231 ) per manufacturers’ instructions . Concentrated virus was resuspended in mES media ( serum + LIF ) and added to 5 million cells in the presence of polybrene ( Millipore TR - 1003 ) at 8 m g / mL . After 24 hours , viral media was removed and fresh media containing Blasticidin ( Invitrogen ant - bl - 1 ) at 10 m g / mL . Cells were selected until all cells on non - trans - duced plates died . Two additional lentiviral constructs were generated ( pAW12 . lentiguide - GFP , pAW13 . lentiguide - mCherry ) by modifying lentiGuide - puro ( lentiGuide - Puro was a gift from Feng Zhang ( Addgene plasmid # 52963 ) ( Sanjana et al . , 2014 ) ) to remove the puro - mycin and replace it either GFP or mCherry . The tethering guide RNAs ( Table S5 , etv4 _ p _ sgT1 _ F & R , etv4 _ p _ sgT2 _ F & R ) were then cloned into pAW12 and pAW13 . Virus was generated as described above and mES cells were transduced . Double positive cells were identiﬁed and collected by ﬂow cytometry and expanded . These expanded cell lines were analyzed by 4C - seq , ChIP - qPCR ( anti - Cas9 , CST 14697 ) , and RT - qPCR exactly as described elsewhere in the methods . QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS ChIP - MS data analysis Previously published ChIP - ms data was downloaded ( Ji et al . , 2015 ) . For each mark , the log 2 ratio of the immunoprecipitation over the input and over IgG was calculated . Then a high conﬁdence set of proteins was identiﬁed by ﬁltering out all proteins that had a log 2 fold change less than or equal to one in either the input or IgG control . Then we ﬁltered for transcription factors using the annotation provided in the original table to end up with the 26 candidates displayed in Figure 1 . Tissue speciﬁc expression analysis In order to identify candidate structuring factors that are broadly expressed across many tissues , tissue speciﬁc expression data from RNA - seq was downloaded from the Genotype - Tissue Expression ( GTEx ) Project ( release V6p ) . Genes were considered to be ex - pressed in a particular tissues if the median reads per million per kilobase for that tissue was greater than 5 ( RPKM > 5 ) . Broadly ex - pressed genes were identiﬁed as genes that were expressed in greater than 90 % of the 53 tissues surveyed by GTEx . Cell 172 , 1573 – 1588 . e1 – e19 , December 14 , 2017 e11 Deﬁnition of regulatory regions Throughout the manuscript multiple analyses rely on overlaps with different regulatory regions , namely enhancers , promoters , and insulators . Here we explain how these regulatory regions were deﬁned . Promoters Promoters were deﬁned as ± 2 kilobases from the transcription start site . Active Promoters Active promoters were deﬁned as ± 2 kilobases from the transcription start site that overlapped with a H3K27ac peak . Enhancers Enhancers were deﬁned as H3K27ac peaks that did not overlap with a promoter . Insulators Insulators were deﬁned by downloading the called insulated neighborhoods from ( Hnisz et al . , 2016a ) ( available at : http : / / younglab . wi . mit . edu / insulatedneighborhoods . htm ) . Each row represents an insulated neighborhood ( deﬁned as a SMC1 cohesin ChIA - PET interaction with both anchors overlapping a CTCF peak ) . The ﬁle contains six columns , columns 1 - 3 contain the coordinates for the left interaction anchors of the insulated neighborhoods , and columns 4 - 6 contain the coordinates for the right interaction anchors of the insulated neighborhoods . Columns 1 - 3 and 4 - 6 were concatenated and then ﬁltered to identify the unique anchors . The unique loop anchors regions correspond to SMC1 ChIA - PET peaks . Insulators elements were identiﬁed as the subset of CTCF ChIP - seq peaks that overlapped the unique anchors . Super - enhancers Oct4 / Sox2 / Nanog / Med1 super - enhancers and constituents were downloaded from ( Whyte et al . , 2013 ) Typical - enhancer constituents Oct4 / Sox2 / Nanog / Med1 typical - enhancer constituents were downloaded from ( Whyte et al . , 2013 ) ChIP - seq data analysis Alignment Reads from ChIP - seq experiments were aligned to the mm9 revision of the mouse reference genome using only annotated chromo - somes 1 - 19 , chrX , chrY , and chrM or to the hg19 revision of the human genome using only annotated chromosomes 1 - 22 , chrX , chrY , and chrM . Alignment was performed using bowtie ( Langmead et al . , 2009 ) with parameters – best – k 1 – m 1 – sam and – l set to read length ( mouse ) or – best – k 2 – m 2 – sam and – I set to read length ( human ) . Read pileup for display Wiggle ﬁles representing counts of ChIP - Seq reads across the reference genome were created using MACS ( Zhang et al . , 2008 ) with parameters – w – S – space = 50 – nomodel – shiftsize = 200 . Resulting wiggle ﬁles were normalized for sequencing depth by dividing the read counts in each bin by the millions of mapped reads in each sample and were visualized in the UCSC genome browser ( Kent et al . , 2002 ) . Gene list and promoter list For mouse data analysis 36 , 796 RefSeq transcripts were downloaded in the GTF format from the UCSC genome browser on February 1 , 2017 . For human data analysis , 39 , 967 RefSeq transcripts were downloaded on December 7 th , 2016 in the GTF format from the UCSC genome browser on February 1 , 2017 . For each transcript , a promoter was created that is a 4 , 000 bp window centered on the transcription start site . Promoters with the same start coordinate , end coordinate , and gene name were collapsed into one representative promoter . Peak calling Regions with an exceptionally high coverage of ChIP - Seq reads ( i . e . , peaks ) were identiﬁed using MACS with parameters – keep - dup = auto – p1e - 9 and with corresponding input control . Heatmaps and Metagenes Proﬁles of ChIP - seq and GRO - seq signal at individual regions of interest were created by quantifying the signal in reads per million per base pair ( rpm / bp ) in bins that equally divide each region of interest using bamToGFF ( https : / / github . com / BradnerLab / pipeline ) with parameters – m 200 – r – d . Reads used for quantiﬁcation were removed of presumed PCR duplicate reads using samtools v0 . 1 . 19 - 44428cd rmdup ( Li et al . , 2009 ) . Promoters with the same gene id , chromosome , start , and end coordinates were collapsed into one instance . Heatmaps of ChIP - seq proﬁles were used to display ChIP - seq signal at enhancer and active promoters . Each row of a heatmap represents an individual region of interest with the ChIP - seq signal proﬁle at that region displayed in rpm / bp in a ± 2kb region centered on the region of interest . For each heatmap the number of regions of interest are displayed in parentheses in the ﬁgure panel . For murine ES cell heatmaps , ChIP - seq signal was quantiﬁed in 200 bins per region of interest . For human tissues and non - ES cell murine tissues , heatmaps were generated by quantifying ChIP - seq signal in 50 bins per region of interest . Metagene plots were used to display the average ChIP - seq signal across related regions of interest . Metagene plots were gener - ated for enhancer , promoter , and insulator elements , separately . The average proﬁle ( metagene ) was calculated by calculating the mean ChIP - seq or GRO - seq signal proﬁles across the related regions of interest . For each metagene plot , the average proﬁle is dis - played in rpm / bp in a ± 2kb region centered on the regions of interest . The number of enhancers , promoters , and insulators surveyed are noted in parentheses . To facilitate comparisons of the ChIP - seq signal from a single factor between different sets of regions , the e12 Cell 172 , 1573 – 1588 . e1 – e19 , December 14 , 2017 total ChIP - seq signal for each metagene analysis was quantiﬁed and is displayed in the top right corner of each metagene plot . We note that different antibodies have different immunoprecipitation efﬁciencies resulting in different signal intensities . Therefore , we believe that quantitative comparisons should be made across different sites in the same ChIP rather than across different ChIPs at the same site . In Figure S1F super - enhancer and typical enhancer constituent metagenes were ﬂoored by subtracting the smallest mean value across all bins in the typical enhancer constituent from each of the bins displayed . RNA - seq data analysis RNA - seq Analysis RNA - seq data was aligned and quantiﬁed using kallisto ( version 0 . 43 . 0 ) ( Bray et al . , 2016 ) with the following parameters : - b 100 – sin - gle - l 180 - s 20 using the mm9 RefSeq transcriptome ( downloaded on February 1 , 2017 ) . The output ﬁles represent the estimated transcript counts . Differential gene expression analysis was performed using deseq2 ( version 1 . 14 . 1 ) ( Love et al . , 2014 ) . Analysis was performed on the gene level . To calculate the gene - level read counts , the estimated transcript counts were summed across all the isoforms of the gene . This was then input into deseq2 and adjusted p values were calculated using the default settings . Log 2 fold changes and adjusted p values are included in Table S2 . An FDR value of 0 . 05 was used as a cut off for signiﬁcant differential expression . For Fig - ure 5C , the values on the y axis are the deseq2 - calculated log 2 fold change values . The values on the x axis are the deseq2 calculated baseMean values . For Figure 5D , the absolute value of the deseq2 calculated log 2 fold change is plotted on the left side . On the right side the YY1 density at the promoter is plotted . Because the analysis is done on the gene level , the YY1 promoter signal for genes with multiple isoforms was averaged . For the GO analysis the list of differentially expressed genes ( Table S3 ) was input into the PANTHER GO analysis web tool ( http : / / pantherdb . org / , Version 11 . 1 ) ( Mi et al . , 2013 , 2017 ) and a statistical overrepresentation test was performed using the default settings . RNA - seq Display For displaying RNA - seq tracks , the RNA - seq data was mapped with Tophat to the mm9 RefSeq transcriptome ( downloaded on February 1 , 2017 ) using the following parameters : - n 10 tophat - p 10 – no - novel - juncs – o . Wiggle ﬁles representing counts of RNA - Seq reads across the reference genome were created using MACS ( Zhang et al . , 2008 ) with parameters – w – S – space = 50 – nomodel – shiftsize = 200 . Resulting wiggle ﬁles were normalized for sequencing depth by dividing the read counts in each bin by the millions of mapped reads in each sample and were visualized in the UCSC genome browser ( Kent et al . , 2002 ) . Single - cell RNA - seq Analysis Sequencing data was demultiplexed using the 10X Genomics Cell Ranger software ( version 2 . 0 . 0 ) and aligned to the mm10 transcrip - tome . Unique molecular identiﬁers were collapsed into a gene - barcode matrix representing the counts of molecules per cell as deter - mined and ﬁltered by Cell Ranger using default parameters . Normalized expression values were generated using Cell Ranger using the default parameters . For Figure 5H the number of cells with a > 1 normalized expression value for the speciﬁed transcript were counted . For Figure S5C the cells were arranged by principal component analysis using the default Cell Ranger parameters . In Fig - ure S5D cells were split into the two panels based on what condition they came from . The arrangement is the same as in Figure S5C . Individual cells are then colored by normalized expression level . 4C - seq data analysis 4C - seq Analysis The 4C - seq samples were processed using fourfold ( https : / / github . com / younglab / fourfold ) . Samples were ﬁrst processed by removing their associated read primer sequences ( Table S5 ) from the 5 0 end of each FASTQ read . To improve mapping efﬁciency of the trimmed reads by making the read longer , the restriction enzyme digest site was kept on the trimmed read . After trimming the reads , the reads were mapped using bowtie with options – k 1 – m 1 against the mm9 genome assembly . All unmapped or repet - itively mapping reads were discarded from further analysis . The mm9 genome was then ‘‘digested’’ in silico according to the restric - tion enzyme pair used for that sample to identify all the fragments that could be generated by a 4C experiment given a restriction enzyme pair . All mapped reads were assigned to their corresponding fragment based on where they mapped to the genome . The digestion of a sample in a 4C experiment creates a series of ‘‘blind’’ and ‘‘non - blind’’ fragments as described by the Tanay and De Laat labs ( van de Werken et al . , 2012a ) . In brief , ‘‘blind’’ fragments lack a secondary restriction enzyme site whereas ‘‘non - blind’’ fragments contain a secondary restriction enzyme site . Because of this we expect to only observe reads derived from non - blind frag - ments . We therefore only used reads derived from non - blind fragments . Experiments were conducted in biological triplicate and the mutant and WT samples were quantile normalized with each other . If no reads were detected at a non - blind fragment for a given sample when reads were detected in at least one other sample , we assigned a ‘‘0’’ to that non - blind fragment for the sample ( s ) missing reads . 4C - seq Display To display 4C - seq genomic coverage tracks , we ﬁrst smoothed the normalized 4C - seq signal using a 5kb running mean at 50bp steps across the genome for each sample . Individual replicates are displayed in Figure S4 . Next , biological replicates of the same condition were combined and the mean and 95 % conﬁdence interval of the 4C - seq signal for each bin across the genome was Cell 172 , 1573 – 1588 . e1 – e19 , December 14 , 2017 e13 calculated . In Figure 4 and Figure 7 , the 4C - seq signal tracks display the mean 4C - seq signal along the genome as a line and the 95 % conﬁdence interval as the shaded area around the line . For each 4C - seq signal track , the viewpoint used in the 4C - seq experiment is indicated as an arrow labeled VP . To quantify the change in 4C - seq signal in a speciﬁc region of interest , the normalized 4C - seq signal ( non - smoothed ) was counted for each sample and the mean and standard deviation of the quantiﬁed signal was calculated for biological replicates of the same condition . The mean and standard deviation of the quantiﬁed signal was normalized to the appropriate control condition ( either WT or dCas9 ) before plotting . Below each 4C - seq signal track , the quantiﬁed region is indicated as a red bar labeled ‘‘Quantiﬁed region . ’’ The coordinates of the quantiﬁed region for Raf1 are chr6 : 115598005 - 115604631 , and for Etv4 are chr11 : 101644625 - 101648624 . ChIA - PET data analysis ChIA - PET Read Processing For each ChIA - PET dataset , raw reads were processed in order to identify a set of putative interactions that connect interaction an - chors for further statistical modeling and analysis . First , paired - end tags ( PETs ) , each containing two paired reads , were analyzed for the presence of the bridge - linker sequence and trimmed to facilitate read mapping . PETs containing at least one instance of the bridge - linker sequence in either of the two reads were kept for further processing and reads containing the bridge - linker sequence were trimmed immediately before the linker sequence using cutadapt with options ‘‘ - n 3 - O 3 - m 15 - a forward = ACGCGATATCT TATCTGACT - a reverse = AGTCAGATAAGATATCGCGT’’ ( http : / / cutadapt . readthedocs . io / en / stable / ) . PETs that did not contain an instance of the bridge - linker sequence were not processed further . Trimmed reads were mapped individually to the mm9 mouse reference genome using Bowtie with options ‘‘ - n 1 - m 1 - p 6’’ ( Langmead et al . , 2009 ) . After alignment , paired reads were re - linked with an in - house script using read identiﬁers . To avoid potential artifacts arising from PCR bias , redundant PETs with identical genomic mapping coordinates and strand information were collapsed into a single PET . Potential interaction anchors were determined by identifying regions of local enrichment in the individually mapped reads using MACS with options ‘‘ - g mm - p 1e - 9 – nolambda – nomodel – shiftsize = 100’’ ( Zhang et al . , 2008 ) . PETs with two mapped reads that each overlapped a different potential interaction anchor by at least 1 bp were used to identify putative interactions between the overlapped interaction anchors . Each putative interaction represents a connection between two interaction anchors and is supported by the number of PETs ( PET count ) that connect the two interaction anchors . ChIA - PET Statistical Analysis Overview In processing our chromatin interaction data , we sought to identify the putative interactions that represent structured chromatin con - tacts , deﬁned as chromatin contacts that are structured by forces other than the ﬁber dynamics resulting from the linear genomic distance between the two contacting regions . In contrast , we sought to ﬁlter out putative interactions that likely result from PETs arising from non - structured chromatin contacts , deﬁned as contacts resulting from the close linear genomic proximity of the two con - tacting regions , or from technical artifacts of the ChIA - PET protocol . We expect that putative interactions that represent structured chromatin contacts should be detected with greater frequency , or PET count , than expected given the linear genomic distance be - tween the two contacting regions , allowing us to distinguish between these two classes of interactions . To this end , we developed Origami , a statistical method to identify high - conﬁdence interactions that are likely to represent struc - tured chromatin contacts . Conceptually , Origami uses a semi - Bayesian two - component mixture model to estimate the probability that a putative interaction corresponds to one of two groups : structured chromatin contacts , or non - structured chromatin contacts and technical artifacts . Origami estimates this as a probability score for each putative interaction by modeling the relationship be - tween PET count , linear genomic distance between interaction anchors , and read depth at the interaction anchors . High - conﬁdence interactions are then identiﬁed as the subset of putative interactions that are likely to represent structured chromatin contacts , by requiring high - conﬁdence interactions to have a probability score > 0 . 9 . All the methods below were developed within the origami software that is available at https : / / github . com / younglab / origami . The version used was version 1 . 1 ( tagged on GitHub repository as v1 . 1 ) . The software below was run with the following parameters : – it - erations = 10000 – burn - in = 100 – prune = 0 – min - dist = 4000 – peak - count - ﬁlter = 5 . Origami Statistical Model We developed Origami , a method to analyze ChIA - PET data , in order to identify putative interactions that likely represent structured chromatin contacts , and to ﬁlter out putative interactions that likely represent non - structured chromatin contacts that occur as a result of the close linear genomic proximity of contacting regions and interactions that represent technical artifacts of the ChIA - PET protocol . This includes modeling of the relationship between the number of PETs observed to support each interaction ð I i Þ , linear genomic distance between interaction anchors ð d i Þ , and the sequencing depth at the interaction anchors , to estimate the probability that each putative interaction ð i Þ represents a structured chromatin contact given the observed PET count ð I i Þ . We initially assume that putative interactions classify into one of two groups , j ˛ f 0 ; 1 g , such that each putative interaction , i ˛ f 1 : : N g , has a latent group identity Z i that corresponds to a value of j . Group 1 is designated as the set of putative interactions resulting from structured chromatin contacts that we expect to detect with greater frequencies than expected given the linear genomic distance between the contacting regions . Group 0 is designated as the set of putative interactions resulting from non - struc - tured chromatin contacts due to close linear genomic proximity of the contacting regions , or from technical artifacts of the ChIA - PET protocol . e14 Cell 172 , 1573 – 1588 . e1 – e19 , December 14 , 2017 We developed a semi - Bayesian two - component mixture model to estimate the probability that each putative interaction repre - sents a structured chromatin contact . For each group , we modeled the likelihood to observe the PET count ð I i Þ under that group as a Poisson process with two underlying factors . These factors are the number of PETs observed as a result of being part of the group ð G ij Þ , and the number of PETs observed as a result of the linear genomic distance between the anchors given the group ð D ij Þ . We modeled the number of PETs observed as a result of being part of the group ð G ij Þ as a Poisson process with mean , l j . We modeled the number of PETs observed as a result of the linear genomic distance between the anchors given the group ð D ij Þ as a Poisson process with mean , m ij . Since these two factors are thought to be independent ( Phanstiel et al . , 2015 ) , the total Poisson process is the summation of these two underlying factors . We modeled the data variables under the following distributions : I i (cid:3) X j ˛ f 0 ; 1 g w ij (cid:5) ð G ij + D ij Þ G ij (cid:3) Poisson ð l j Þ D ij (cid:3) Poisson (cid:2) m ij ð d i Þ (cid:3) I i (cid:3) Poisson (cid:2) l j + m ij ð d i Þ (cid:3) : We modeled our parameters with the following prior distributions : l j (cid:3) Gamma ð 1 ; 1 Þ w i 1 (cid:3) Beta ð 1 + a i ; 1 + b i Þ : Since w i 1 is a binomial probability , w i 0 = 1 (cid:1) w i 1 . From these priors and likelihood distributions , the posterior distributions of these parameters are as follows : l j (cid:3) Gamma " 1 + X Z i = j G ij ; 1 + # ð Z i = j Þ # w i 1 (cid:3) Beta ½ 1 + a i + Zi ; 1 + b i + ð 1 (cid:1) Zi Þ(cid:6) : Aside from D ij and m ij , we estimated the parameters using the iterative process Markov Chain Monte Carlo ( MCMC ) with Gibbs Sam - pling with the appropriate posterior to sample from ( Gelman et al . , 2004 ) . To estimate m ij , we modeled the function between D ij and the linear genomic distance ð d i Þ on the log10 scale using a smoothed cubic spline ( via smooth . spline in R ) , taking m ij to be the expected number of PETs to be observed due to distance ð D ij Þ given the linear genomic distance ð d i Þ , for each putative interaction ð i Þ . The constants a i and b i were set to be as minimally informative as possible . The constant a i was set equal to the number of putative interactions sharing one anchor with i that have PET counts less than I i . The constant b i was set equal to the number of putative in - teractions sharing one anchor with i that have PET counts greater than I i plus the ratio of the depth score ð s i Þ to the median depth score with all values < 1 ﬂoored to 0 . The depth score ð s i Þ for each putative interaction is deﬁned as the product of the number of reads that map to its interaction anchors . Origami Implementation We implemented the model described above by Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation . By iteratively estimating the group identity ð Z i Þ of each putative interaction , we sought to explore the probability space for Z i and determined a probability score ð p i Þ for each putative interaction that reﬂects the probability that the interaction results from a structured chromatin contact ( belongs to group 1 ) . The steps in our implementation are as follows . 1 . For each putative interaction , we recorded the number of PETs observed that support the interaction ð I i Þ , the linear genomic distance of the interaction between the outermost basepairs of the putative interaction’s two anchors ð d i Þ , and a depth score ð s i Þ , which is deﬁned as the product of the number of the reads in the dataset that map to each anchor of the putative interaction . Cell 172 , 1573 – 1588 . e1 – e19 , December 14 , 2017 e15 2 . To seed the parameters of the model for the ﬁrst iteration , the following was performed . The mixing weights ð w ij Þ were set to be equal at 0 . 5 for each interaction . The group process means ð l j Þ were assigned values of 5 and 1 for group 1 and 0 , respectively . The distance process mean ð m ij Þ was initially set to 0 for all interactions . 3 . Additionally values of a i and b i were computed for each interaction , but not used in the ﬁrst iteration . In all subsequent itera - tions , a i and b i , are used in updating the values of the mixing weights ð w ij Þ . The parameter a i was set equal to the number of putative interactions sharing one anchor with i that have PET counts less than I i . The parameter b i was set equal to the number of putative interactions sharing one anchor with i that have PET counts greater than I i plus the ratio of the depth score ð s i Þ over the median depth score for all putative interactions , where when this ratio is less than 1 it is ﬂoored to 0 . 4 . For each putative interaction , we estimated the likelihood ð l ij Þ that the putative interaction is observed with PET count ð I i Þ , given that the putative interaction belongs to group 1 and group 0 , as follows : l ij = dPoisson (cid:4) I i ; l j + m ij (cid:5) where dPoisson is the density function of the Poisson distribution for the mean l j + m ij and evaluated on I i . 5 . We calculated the relative weighted likelihood ð r i Þ of each putative interaction belonging to group 1 . To do this we multiplied each of the two likelihoods calculated for each putative interaction by their respective mixing weights ð w ij Þ and evaluated as follows . r i = w i 1 (cid:5) L i 1 ð w i 1 (cid:5) L i 1 Þ + ð w i 0 (cid:5) L i 0 Þ : 6 . We update the group identity ð Z i Þ of each interaction by drawing from the binomial distribution with a probability of r i as follows . Z i = rBinomial ð 1 ; r i Þ where rBinomial means we randomly draw 1 or 0 with the probability of r i for drawing 1 . 7 . We update the mixing weights ð w ij Þ using our newly updated group identies ð Z i Þ , by drawing from the Beta distribution in the following way : w i 1 = rBeta ½ 1 + a i + Zi ; 1 + b i + ð 1 (cid:1) Zi Þ(cid:6) where rBeta means we randomly draw from the beta distribution with the above parameters . Since w i 1 is a binomial probabil - ity , w i 0 = 1 (cid:1) w i 1 . 8 . In order to estimate the PET counts for G ij and D ij , we randomly sampled the number of PETs for G ij and D ij by taking advantage of the fact that when two Poisson variables are known to sum to a given count , then the distribution of either variable follows a binomial distribution with probability l j = ð l j + m ij Þ . Accordingly , we estimated the PET counts for G ij and D ij in the following way : G ij = rBinomial (cid:6) I i ; l j l j + m ij (cid:7) D ij = I i (cid:1) G ij where rBinomial means we randomly draw up to I i PETs with the probabilty l j = ð l j + m ij Þ of drawing each PET . 9 . We update the group process mean ð l j Þ using the following identity , requiring that l 1 > l 0 in order to maintain identiﬁability of the two groups ( although during our runs this constraint was not necessary ) . e16 Cell 172 , 1573 – 1588 . e1 – e19 , December 14 , 2017 l j = rGamma 1 + X Z i = j G ij ; 1 + # ð Z i = j Þ ! where rGamma means we randomly draw from the Gamma distribution with the above parameters . 10 . To update the distance process means ð m ij Þ , we calculated the function between D ij and the log 10 ð d i + 1 Þ , using a smoothed cubic spline ( via smooth . spline in R ) . To simplify estimation of m ij , we chose to take the maximum likelihood estimate of this process . 11 . We iterated steps 4 - 10 in the following way . We performed an initial 1 , 000 iterations as a burn - in , which were discarded . Then we performed 10 , 000 iterations . 12 . We estimated the probability that each putative interaction belongs to group 1 by calculating a probability score ð p i Þ for each putative interaction that equals the mean value of Z i across the 10 , 000 iterations . High - conﬁdence interactions were identiﬁed as putative interactions with p i > 0 : 9 . p i = 1 # ð iterations Þ X Z i z P ð Zi = 1 Þ : HiChIP data analysis HiChIP Processing The HiChIP samples were processed by ﬁrst identifying reads with a restriction fragment junction ( i . e . , a site where ligation occurred ) . Reads containing the restriction fragment junction were trimmed such that the information 5 0 to the junction was kept . Reads without restriction fragment junctions were left untrimmed . Reads were then mapped using bowtie with options – k 1 – m 1 against the mm9 genome assembly . All unmapped or repetitively mapping reads were discarded from further analysis . Reads were joined back together in pairs by their read identiﬁer . The genome was binned and for every pair of bins the number of PETs joining them was calcu - lated . These data were then used as input into the Origami pipeline described above to identify signiﬁcant bin to bin interaction pairs . HiChIP Analysis Quantitative analysis of HiChIP and Hi - C data ( Figures 6 and 7 ) was done as follows . High - conﬁdence interactions were identiﬁed by Origami . A union of high - conﬁdence interactions was then created for each experiment .

The PET counts were then normalized to each other using deseq2 ( Love et al . , 2014 ) . The mean of each group was then calculated and then the fold change was then calculated by taking the ratio of the perturbed condition to the non - perturbed condition ( i . e . , yesDrug to noDrug or TR / UT ; WO / UT ) with a pseudocount of 0 . 5 added to both . This complete set of signiﬁcant interactions is what is displayed in Fig - ure 6B as ‘‘All Interactions . ’’ For subset analysis the anchor of each interaction was classiﬁed by overlapping with known genomic features as deﬁned earlier . This resulted in a binary score for whether an anchor overlapped with an enhancer , promoter , insulator , YY1 , or CTCF . The interac - tions were then subset to identify the following groups : YY1 not present ( Figure 6 ) : no YY1 at either end of the interaction . YY1 enhancer - promoter interactions ( Figures 6 and 7 ) : YY1 at both ends AND an enhancer or promoter at both ends . CTCF - CTCF interaction : CTCF at both ends . The log 2 fold change for these groups is plotted in Figures 6B and 7F . The analysis in Figure 6C was done by identifying the gene at the end of YY1 enhancer - promoter loops . This was done by intersecting promoters ( as deﬁned above ) with the signiﬁcant loop anchors . Genes with multiple promoters were collapsed after the intersection to generate a list of genes at the end of YY1 enhancer - promoter loops . The deseq2 calculated log 2 fold change for these genes is then plotted in Figure 6C . Genes are colored based on the deseq2 calculated adjusted p value ( as in Figure 5 ) . HiChIP Display HiChIP interaction matrices displayed in Figures 6D and 6E . For these interaction matrices , all putative interactions are displayed and the intensity of each pixel represents the mean of the deseq2 normalized interaction frequency of all biological replicates of that con - dition . In Figures 6D and 6E the outlined pixel , which reﬂects the frequency of interaction between sites at the base of the diagonals , was used to quantify the change in normalized interaction frequency upon YY1 degradation . In Figure 2 , high - conﬁdence HiChIP interactions are displayed as arcs . For display , the interactions displayed were ﬁltered to re - move bin to adjacent bin contacts and non - enhancer - promoter interactions . Arcs were centered on the relevant genomic feature within the bin ( for example a ChIP - seq peak summit or transcription start site ) . Interaction classiﬁcation High - conﬁdence ChIA - PET and HiChIP interactions were classiﬁed based on the presence of enhancer , promoter , and insulator elements at the anchors of each interaction as deﬁned above . In the case where an interaction anchor overlapped both an enhancer and an insulator or a promoter and an insulator a hierarchy where anchors were considered ﬁrst as pro - moters , then enhancers , then insulators . For example , if there is an interaction where the left anchor is insulator / promoter and the right anchor is enhancer / insulator it would be counted as an enhancer - promoter interaction and not an insulator - insu - lator interaction . To display summaries of the classes of high - conﬁdence interactions , each class of interactions is displayed as an arc between the relevant enhancer , promoter , and insulator elements . The thickness of the arcs approximately reﬂects the per - centage of interactions of that class relative to the total number of interactions that were classiﬁed . In the main ﬁgures , enhancer - enhancer , enhancer - promoter , promoter - promoter , and insulator - insulator interaction classes are displayed . Extended summaries that additionally include enhancer - insulator and promoter - insulator interactions are displayed in the sup - plemental ﬁgures . Figure Display In certain ﬁgure panels displaying genome tracks , enhancer elements are indicated as red boxes labeled ‘‘Enhancer . ’’ These regions represent the authors’ interpretation of the ChIP - seq data and are distinct from the algorithmically deﬁned enhancers used in the quantitative genome - wide analysis . Statistical Analysis In order to use the unpaired t test we made two assumptions . 1 ) Populations are distributed according to a Gaussian distribution . For most experiments three replicates were used , and so sample sizes were too small to reliably calculate departure from normality ( i . e . , with a D’Agostino test ) . 2 ) The two populations have the same variance . A test for variance was not carried out . e18 Cell 172 , 1573 – 1588 . e1 – e19 , December 14 , 2017 Full p values are listed here * : DATA AND SOFTWARE AVAILABILITY All datasets used are summarized in Table S4 .

( B ) Activityof puriﬁed recombinant YY1protein wasvalidated byEMSA . PuriﬁedYY1was incubated withbiotinylated DNAprobe inthepresenceorabsence ofa non - biotinylated competitor DNA . Activity of the recombinant protein was assessed by the ability to bind DNA and was determined by resolution on a native gel . Unbound ‘‘free’’ biotinylated probe is found at the bottom of the gel , while probe bound by YY1 migrates slower and appears as a higher band . Addition of competitor DNA abrogates this effect indicating that the activity is speciﬁc . Figure S4 .
