How tension and volume are coupled during osmotic adaptation remains unknown , as a quantitative characterization is lacking . Here , we performed dynamic membrane tension and cell volume measurements during osmotic shocks . During the ﬁrst few seconds following the shock , cell volume varied to equilibrate osmotic pressures inside and outside the cell , and membrane tension dynamically followed these changes . A theoretical model based on the passive , reversible unfolding of the membrane as it detaches from the actin cortex during volume increase , quantitatively describes our data . After the initial response , tension and volume recovered from hypoosmotic shocks but not from hyperosmotic shocks . During these asymmetric recoveries , tension and volume remained coupled . Pharmacological disruption of the cytoskeleton and functional inhibition of ion channels and mTOR all affected tension and volume responses , proving that a passive mechanism is necessary and critical for the cell to adapt fast . The coupling between them was , nonetheless , maintained for a few exceptions suggesting that volume and tension regulations are independent from the regulation of their coupling . Introduction 1 Lipid membranes are self - assembled viscoelastic bilayers separating cells and their organelles from their 2 environment . They are easy to bend but resistant to stretching : their lysis tension - the tension at which they 3 break - is high , in the range of a few mN / m 1 , 2 . This high value protects cells against lysis upon processes 4 that stretch the cell membrane . Plasma membrane tension arises from the combined contributions of 5 osmotic pressure , in - plane tension and cytoskeletal forces 3 , 4 . The cytoskeleton is intimately linked to all 6 processes regulating membrane tension , in particular cell volume regulation 5 . For example , hypotonic 7 shocks are not only responsible for increasing membrane tension but also induce the degradation of 8 vimentin 6 and a reorganization of actin ﬁlaments 7 , 8 , without affecting microtubules 6 . It has been proposed 9 that the cytoskeleton regulates membrane tension by setting its value through active force generation , and 10 by establishing a membrane reservoir that buffers acute changes in tension 9 . This membrane reservoir is 11 stored around protruding actin - based structures such as rufﬂes , ﬁlopodia and microvilli 10 . Cell volume 12 regulation during osmotic changes involves mechano - sensitive ion channels 2 , 11 regulated by membrane 13 tension 12 , 13 . How ion channel activity is coupled to the cytoskeleton is under debate 14 . The channels 14 comprise volume - regulated anion channels ( VRACs ) , sodium - hydrogen antiporters ( NHEs ) and Na - K - Cl 15 cotransporters ( NKCC1 ) . VRACs are activated by hypotonic stress 15 , 16 and are unique in transporting 16 small organic osmolytes – in particular taurine - in addition to anions 17 , 18 . NHEs inhibition prevents 17 regulatory volume increases of cells 19 , 20 . Cells have evolved to respond to changes in membrane tension 18 so as to control their impact on many processes essential to cell life 21 . The genetic response to an 19 osmotic stress has been studied extensively . This pathway partly consists of activating genes involved 20 in the synthesis or degradation of osmo - protectant molecules ( such as glycerol in yeast , and amino 21 acids in mammalian cells ) , and their subsequent secretion 19 , 22 – 26 . However , the genetic response minute 22 timescale cannot account for the cell’s immediate resistance to stretch 19 , 23 . The master regulator of 23 plasma membrane tension is probably Target of Rapamycin Complex 2 ( TORC2 ) 27 and its mammalian 24 homologous mTORC2 . Indeed , TORC2 signaling increases instantaneously upon membrane tension 25 increase 28 as well as mTORC2 activity 29 , and decreases upon tension loss 26 . TORC2 regulates endocytosis 26 through membrane tension 30 , but also actin polymerization 31 . Despite its undeniable importance , the 27 mechanisms driving the regulation of membrane tension during osmotic shocks in relation to cell volume 28 changes are still not understood . Qualitatively , membrane tension has been reported to decrease in response 29 to hypertonic shocks 32 , 33 , while studies have reported that it either stays constant 33 , 34 or increases 32 , 35 , 36 30 upon hypotonic shock . The relation between osmolarity and cell volume change is captured by the 31 Ponder / Boyle / Vant’Hoff ( PBVH ) relation whereby the cell shrinks until the osmotic pressure of its 32 contents matches that of the extracellular medium 37 . This relation involves an osmotically inactive volume 33 ( OIV ) which represents the minimum volume occupied by tightly packed cellular constituents at very high 34 hypertonicity 38 , 39 . In addition , while the PBVH relation describes the changes in cell volume in response 35 to an osmotic shock , the response of the membrane tension to such shocks has never been quantitatively 36 studied . In this study , we elucidate quantitatively the coupling between cell volume and membrane tension 37 in single cells during osmotic shocks using time - resolved techniques . 38 Results 39 We exposed HeLa Kyoto cells to step - wise osmotic shocks ( Fig 1a , see Methods ) . A few seconds after 40 a hypotonic shock with 75 % water , cell volume peaked at approx . 2 . 4 times the initial volume . The 41 volume subsequently recovered , but only partially , leaving a 15 % volume increase after 10 min ( Fig 1b ) . 42 Weaker dilutions ( 50 % and 25 % ) led to lower peaks and faster recovery ( Fig 1b ) . Conversely , hypertonic 43 shocks led to a rapid volume decrease within seconds , followed by a 10 min plateau . In the most extreme 44 hypertonic conditions ( 3500 mOsm ) , cell volume decreased by up to 90 % ( Supp Fig 1a - b ) . Before the 45 2 / 22 Figure 1 .

To 47 assess the robustness of the recovery dynamics , we performed cell volume measurements using a different 48 cell type ( HL - 60 / S4 ) using real - time deformability cytometry ( RT - DC ) – a high - throughput technique 49 allowing for rapid characterization of thousands of cells 40 ( Supp Fig 2a ) . After applying the osmotic 50 shocks to HL - 60 / S4 cells before loading them into RT - DC , we conﬁrmed our previous observation : cell 51 volume in a hypotonic medium peaked and recovered while cell volume in a hypertonic medium abruptly 52 and stably decreased ( Supp Fig 2b - c ) . Our results show that the volume changes associated with osmotic 53 shocks are rapid , and show a recovery for hypotonic shocks which is absent for hypertonic shocks and 54 further demonstrate that cell volume can recover from hypotonic , but not hypertonic , shocks . 55 56 We measured the dynamical changes of membrane tension after osmotic shocks . When membrane 57 tubes are pulled from the cell membrane using beads held with optical tweezers ( Fig 1d ) , the force required 58 to hold the tube is a direct measurement of the membrane tension 41 . The distribution of tube forces 59 before osmotic shock f 0 is broad : 27 ± 18pN ( Fig 1e ) . As seen for volume variations , changes in the 60 tube force upon osmotic shocks were almost instantaneous ( Supp Fig 2d ) . Interestingly , changes of the 61 tube force ( f − f 0 ) / f 0 averaged over 10 seconds immediately following the shock were proportional to 62 the intensity of the shocks ( Fig 1f , Supp Fig 2e - f ) . To follow the dynamics of tension in real - time , we 63 used the molecular probe Flipper - TR ( ﬂuorescent lipid tension reporter , or FliptR R (cid:13) ) that reports changes 64 of membrane tension through changes of its ﬂuorescence lifetime ( Fig 1g - h ) 26 , 30 , 33 , 42 – 46 . Consistently 65 with tube pulling experiments , the lifetime distribution of Flipper - TR in cells membrane before shock 66 was broad : 4 , 76 ± 0 , 15 ns ( Fig 1i ) , and the lifetime changed within seconds after shock ( Fig 1h - 1j ) . We 67 observed an asymmetry in lifetime measurement during recovery phase similar to the one observed for 68 volume measurements : membrane tension peaked and recovered within seconds after hypotonic shock 69 while it decreased within seconds after hypertonic shock , and continued decreasing for the duration of the 70 experiment , although at a lower rate ( Fig 1j ) . Our results show that membrane tension variations after 71 osmotic shocks qualitatively follow cell volume changes . 72 73 To quantitatively capture the relationship between the osmotic pressure of the cell and its volume ( Fig 2a , Supp Fig 3a - c ) , we used the PBVH equation of state 37 , 39 , 47 P ( V − V OI ) = P 0 ( V 0 − V OI ) , ( 1 ) where P is the osmotic pressure of the intracellular medium , V the cell volume and P 0 and V 0 are values 74 of P and V under isotonic conditions . Equation ( 1 ) assimilates the contents of the cell to a solution of 75 particles with steric repulsions and otherwise negligible interactions , with the sum of the particles excluded 76 volumes equal to V OI . The cell volume thus cannot be compressed below the ’osmotically inactive volume’ 77 4 / 22 Figure 2 .

Equation ( 1 ) is in excellent agreement with both our hypertonic and hypotonic data ( Fig 2a ) , when 78 the volume is estimated at the time of hypotonic peak ( 10s after the shock , shown in Fig 1b , Supp Fig 1b ) . 79 A single - parameter ﬁt yields V OI = 300 µ m 3 equal to about 10 % of the initial cell volume , smaller than 80 previous estimates 48 . Interestingly , during and after the recovery phase ( t > 10s after shock ) volume values 81 diverge from this linear relation only in the hypotonic conditions , reﬂecting the asymmetry of recovery 82 ( Fig 2a ) . This explains why previous volume measurements after hypotonic shocks were not in agreement 83 with the PBVH relation , probably because they were performed too late after the shock , at a time when 84 cells had already recovered . 85 86 As the volume of the cell changes , so does the tension and area of its membrane ( Fig 1f - 1j , Supp 87 Fig 2d - f ) . To compute the relation between these quantities , we reasoned that the cell membrane is not a 88 perfectly ﬂat , but is instead heterogeneously folded because of protrusions and buds induced by proteins 89 and cytoskeletal structures . The rufﬂed structure of the membrane would thus provide a large area buffer 9 . 90 Increases in membrane tension unfold these rufﬂes , releasing more membrane area and allowing the cell 91 to expand . To quantitatively model this effect ( see theoretical supplement ) , we described the membrane 92 energy by a modiﬁed Helfrich - Hamiltonian where the spontaneous curvature is randomly distributed 93 according to a Gaussian distribution with exponential correlations . Its statistical properties were described 94 by two parameters : the typical lateral rufﬂe size a ( the correlation length of the noise ) , and the typical 95 magnitude of mean curvature C ( its strength ) . Under these assumptions , the relative change of membrane 96 area during the shock is given by 97 ∆ A A 0 ( σ ) = (cid:115) g ( σ 0 a 2 / κ ) g ( σ a 2 / κ ) − 1 ( 2 ) where σ 0 and σ respectively denote the tension of the membrane in the initial isotonic state and in the 98 ﬁnal state , κ is its bending rigidity and the function g is given by 99 g ( Σ ) = Σ + 2 4 ( Σ − 1 ) 5 / 2 arccos (cid:0) Σ − 1 (cid:1) − 3 4 ( Σ − 1 ) 2 . ( 3 ) We ﬁnd that Eq . ( 2 ) agrees very well with our experimental measurements ( Fig 2b ) . The ﬁt gives 100 σ 0 = 1 . 2 × 10 − 4 N · m − 1 and a rufﬂe size a = 37nm , which are in good agreement with typical cell 101 membrane tensions 49 and the size of the smallest membrane invaginations such as caveolae and endocytic 102 buds 50 . Finally , combining Eqs . ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) yields a prediction for the dependence of the membrane 103 tension on osmotic pressure , which is in good agreement with our data ( Fig 2c ) . These results strongly 104 support the notion that the short - term response of cell volume and membrane tension are predominantly 105 mechanical and thermodynamic , and consists in a passive equalization of the inner and outer osmotic 106 6 / 22 pressures accompanied by an unfolding of membrane rufﬂes ( Fig 2d ) . 107 108 Our veriﬁcation of the PBVH relation yields two surprising results : ﬁrst , we ﬁnd that it holds for 109 a very large range of osmotic pressures in HeLa cells , larger than previously tested . Second , the V OI 110 represents a smaller proportion of V 0 ( only 10 % , as compared to values between 7 % and 50 % in other 111 studies ) . To better understand these results , we used optical diffraction tomography , a 3D tomographic 112 label - free technique , to measure the cells refractive index ( RI ) 51 , 52 hence giving a direct access to changes 113 of mass and concentration in cells subjected to osmotic shocks ( Fig 2e ) . Cells in isotonic conditions had 114 an average RI = 1 . 37 ± 0 . 01 . A few seconds after 1M sucrose shock , cells had an increase in RI to 1 . 42 ± 115 0 . 01 , while under 75 % water shock conditions the RI decreased to 1 . 35 ± 0 . 01 . RI increases linearly with 116 increasing protein concentration 53 . In our experiment , the RI of single cells changed proportionally to the 117 applied osmotic pressure ( Supp Fig 3d ) . This implies that the protein concentration changes proportionally 118 to the osmotic pressure ( Fig 2f ) , which is fully consistent with our ﬁnding that cell volume changes 119 proportionally to the osmotic pressure ( Fig 2a ) . Extracting the concentration from the RI and knowing 120 the average cell volumes allows for calculation of the dry mass for each osmotic condition ( Fig 2g ) . The 121 average dry mass of single HeLa cells was 305 + / - 98 pg ( Supp Fig 3e ) and , as expected , is constant 122 throughout all osmotic shocks ( Fig 2g ) . To directly measure changes of concentration for a single protein 123 within the cytoplasm , we measured the relative change of ﬂuorescence intensity of cells overexpressing 124 cytosolic GFP over time . It also varied proportionally to the osmotic pressure ( Supplementary information , 125 Supp Fig 3f - h ) . Thus , no signiﬁcant amounts of intracellular solutes were exchanged with the environment , 126 in agreement with previous studies 30 , 35 . Our measurement of the dry mass ( Fig 2g ) also enabled an 127 estimation of the V OI . Multiplying the speciﬁc volume of dried proteins ( 0 . 73 ml / g 54 ) by the dry mass , we 128 found V OI = 223 . 34 ± 71 . 88 µ m 3 in agreement with our PBVH ﬁt . 129 130 To understand the origin of the rapid recovery after the hypotonic shock , we studied the contributions 131 of various cellular processes involved in the osmotic response , starting with the cytoskeleton . We ﬁrst 132 imaged the dynamics of the actin cortex during osmotic shocks using SiR - Actin . Upon hypotonic shock , 133 we observed cell blebbing concomitant with cortical actin depolymerization ( Fig 3a ) . Blebs then extended 134 and merged into a large membrane dome ( Fig 3a side view ) . By quantifying cortical actin ﬂuorescence , we 135 observed a complete repolymerization of the cortex four minutes after the shock ( Fig 3b ) , to a value higher 136 than the initial value . Following a hypertonic shock , the actin cytoskeleton appeared more condensed , 137 and its ﬂuorescence intensity gradually increased with time ( Fig 3b ) . We also addressed the behavior of 138 microtubules using SiR - Tubulin . After hypotonic shocks , microtubules also depolymerized and appeared 139 more condensed after a hypertonic shock , but to a smaller extent than actin ( Fig 3c - d ) . These results 140 suggest that actin dynamics is strongly disturbed shortly after osmotic shocks but counteracts high pressure 141 differences by polymerizing over longer times . 142 143 7 / 22 Figure 3 .

We then followed the cell volume and tension changes with time and compared them to 145 untreated cells . As described below , none of the drugs used affected the response to hypertonic shocks ( Fig 146 3f , Supp Fig 4a - b ) , consistent with the hypertonic response being essentially passive . Similarly , both drugs 147 had little effect on the initial peak in cell volume after hypotonic shock , consistent with the short - term 148 response to hypotonicity being passive . However , latrunculin radically modiﬁed the later - time recovery 149 compared to non - treated and jasplakinolide - treated cells . Indeed , the volume of latrunculin - treated cells 150 partially recovered after the initial peak , but then diverged a few minutes after shock ( Fig 3g ) . By contrast , 151 the volume of jasplakinolide treated cells evolved similarly to that of non - treated cells ( Fig 3f ) , although 152 over a shorter time scale . Interestingly , the tension dynamics of both latrunculin and jasplakinolide - treated 153 cells were completely decoupled from volume dynamics , as no peak , and thus no recovery , was observed 154 ( Fig 3g ) . Thus , the actin cortex is a major component of the coupling between membrane tension and 155 volume dynamics ( Fig 3g ) . 156 157 Depolymerization of microtubules with nocodazole had limited effects on the volume dynamics after 158 hypotonic shocks but also decoupled tension from volume changes , as no tension changes were observed 159 ( Fig 3f , Supp Fig 4b ) . Conversely , stabilizing microtubules with taxol clearly affected the dynamics of 160 volume changes , as its peak was signiﬁcantly smaller than in non - treated cells , and no recovery was 161 observed . In taxol - treated cells , tension dynamics closely followed cell volume dynamics even though 162 they were different from non - treated cells ( Fig 3g ) . These results show that tension dynamics can be 163 decoupled from volume dynamics when actin turnover is affected . As seen for taxol - treated cells , it is 164 possible to qualitatively change the volume and tension response to osmotic shock , while preserving their 165 coupling . Finally , none of the treatments affected the hypertonic response , suggesting that cells respond 166 passively to this condition , or at least without the involvement of the cytoskeleton . 167 168 Ion channels are a central regulators of cell volume , and are thus involved in the cell response to 169 osmotic shocks . We used pharmacological inhibitors of the three classes of channels involved in osmotic 170 stress response : DCPIB inhibits VRACs , while EIPA inhibits NHE channels and Bumetanide inhibits 171 NKCC1 channels ( Fig 4a ) . In all hypertonic conditions , none of the inhibitors tested signiﬁcantly affected 172 the cell volume and tension responses , again indicating that the hypertonic response is essentially passive 173 ( Supp Fig 4c ) . However , after hypotonic shocks , we observed a gradual impact of drugs from Bumetamide 174 to DCPIB on the short - term cell swelling . DCPIB - treated cells were instantaneously permeabilized upon 175 strong hypotonic shock , as seen by the instantaneous labelling of intracellular membranes with CellMask 176 ( 75 % water / 90mOsm , Fig 4b ) . Cell volume did not change in milder hypotonic conditions ( 25 % and 177 50 % water , Fig 4c ) . By contrast , cells treated with Bumetamide had a smaller but signiﬁcant peak in cell 178 volume ( Fig 4c ) , and EIPA - treated cells showed no peak immediately after hypotonic shock ( Fig 4c ) . In 179 EIPA - and Bumetamide - treated cells , cell volume slowly diverged three minutes after shock ( Fig 4c ) , 180 9 / 22 Figure 4 .

For all three drugs , the tension dynamics 181 during hypotonic shock was strongly affected ( Fig 4d ) . For Bumetamide and EIPA , the response was 182 clearly decoupled from the volume change , while tension remained constant for DCPIB - treated cells , 183 perfectly matching the volume dynamics . Overall , these results show that ion channels that participate 184 in the osmotic balance of the cell , also participate in the coupling between tension and volume changes 185 during osmotic shocks . 186 187 The rapid recovery of cell volume and tension during hypotonic shocks shows that these parameters are 188 tightly and actively regulated by the cell . mTORC1 and mTORC2 are involved in cell volume regulation 55 189 and membrane tension regulation 29 . Both mTORC1 and mTORC2 are organized around the kinase mTOR , 190 whose phosphorylation can be inhibited using Torin1 which blocks both complexes 56 while rapamycin is 191 a speciﬁc inhibitor of mTORC1 57 . Knowing that both TORC1 and TORC2 are inhibited by hypertonic 192 shocks 24 – 26 , 58 while TORC2 and mTORC2 are activated by hypotonic shock 26 , 28 , 29 , we studied the effect 193 of Torin1 and rapamycin treatments on the cell response to osmotic shocks . Volume changes induced by 194 hypotonic shocks were only mildly affected by rapamycin , while Torin1 - treated cells exhibited a reduced 195 volume peak after hypotonic shocks ( Fig 4c ) when compared to non - treated cells . This suggests a more 196 central role of mTORC2 in comparison to mTORC1 in controlling volume and tension response . To test 197 this further , we looked at the dynamics of the tension in both rapamycin and Torin1 - treated cells . We 198 observed an initial peak of tension in rapamycin - treated cells similar to non - treated cells , followed by a 199 slower recovery of tension . In Torin1 - treated cells , no tension changes were observed ( Fig 4d ) . These 200 results suggest that mTORC2 controls the initial volume / tension coupling , while mTORC2 and mTORC1 201 are involved in the long - term recovery of both volume and tension . Both rapamycin and Torin1 - treated 202 cells did show signiﬁcant changes of their volume and tension responses to hypertonic shock , strongly 203 supporting that the cell response to hypertonic shock is essentially passive ( Supp Fig 4d ) . 204 Discussion 205 Our study highlights the quantitative relation between cell volume changes and cell tension changes . We 206 showed that cell volume changes are mainly due to cytoplasmic volume changes as opposed to changes 207 in the nucleus volume and conﬁrms that cells modulate their volume according to the PBVH relation . 208 Interestingly , we observed two phases of cell volume response to osmotic shocks : the short - term response 209 - a few seconds after the shock - which was characterized by cell volume variations according to the 210 PBVH relation . The second phase - a few tens of seconds to minutes after the shock - which we called 211 the long - term response , and which was characterized by an asymmetric recovery . Indeed , cell volume 212 recovered fast from hypotonic shocks , but did not recover from hypertonic shocks . This asymmetry of 213 response is probably linked to active counteracting cell processes aimed at mitigating the immediate threat 214 to cell life by increased membrane tension . 215 During those two phases , we observed that membrane tension followed cell volume changes . In 216 11 / 22 the short - term response , evolution of tension with volume changes was consistent with a model based 217 on membrane unfolding . Fits to the model yielded an estimate of the size of membrane rufﬂes and 218 invaginations – 37nm – consistent with the smallest membrane structures described in the literature , 219 suggesting that these structures are responsible for the majority of the mechanical response . It also enabled 220 inferring the change of tension according to the change of pressure applied outside the cells . This result is 221 qualitatively maintained during the long - term response , as tension dynamically evolves with the same 222 asymmetry as volume after hypotonic and hypertonic shocks . These results establish that tension passively 223 follows volume changes during the entire duration of the response and recovery to osmotic shocks . 224 However , this passive coupling between the membrane tension and the cell volume was regulated 225 by active processes of the cell such as the cytoskeleton , the ion channels and mTOR pathways . By 226 disrupting actin or depolymerizing microtubules , we observed no difference in the short - term response of 227 cell volume , consistent with the PBVH relation which does not account for the role of the cytoskeleton . 228 In the long - term response to a hypotonic shock , membrane tension did not vary at all while cell volume 229 fully recovered or increased after the recovery , implying a disruption of the coupling between volume 230 and tension . Conversely , when microtubules were stabilized , the coupling between tension and volume 231 change was preserved , even if the overall response was dramatically changed . We also found that blocking 232 ion channels strongly interfered with the cell volume and tension response but their coupling was only 233 affected for the channels transporting sodium ( NHE and NKCC1 ) as opposed to VRACs . Inhibitors of the 234 mTOR pathways strongly decoupled tension and volume responses on the long term response but only the 235 inhibition of mTORC2 lead to a decoupling on the short term response supporting the notion that mTOR 236 signaling is required for adapting the tension to volume changes . Altogether , those result support the 237 hypothesis of a regulation of the volume and the tension independent from the regulation of their coupling . 238 Overall , our results support the notion that a large excess of membrane is stored into rufﬂes main - 239 tained by the cytoskeleton , and that the recovery is required to restore this large excess . When the cell 240 volume dramatically increases because of hypotonicity , the cell initially responds by depolymerizing the 241 cytoskeleton to drive membrane unfolding , which results in a release of membrane surface area . The initial 242 volume recovery is mediated through ion channels , as the cytoskeleton is still disrupted , and ﬁnalized with 243 actin repolymerization to refold the membrane , under the control of mTOR signaling . Our results show 244 that the coupling between tension and volume is actively regulated by the cytoskeleton , ion channels and 245 mTOR signaling to maintain a quantitative relation between volume and tension well described by passive 246 physical mechanisms . 247 Supplementary information 248 Nucleus volume change upon osmotic shock 249 Cells are composed of two main compartments , the cytoplasm and the nucleus . To determine their 250 respective volume changes , we used ﬂuorescence imaging to measure the volume of the nuclei of Hela 251 cells expressing Lamin - B1 - GFP – a component of the nucleus membrane – and measure their volume 252 12 / 22 changes under osmotic shocks . The distribution of initial nuclear volumes is narrower than that of overall 253 cell volumes ( Supp Fig 1e ) centered on 800 ± 150 µ m 3 . The qualitative behavior of nuclei under osmotic 254 shocks was similar to that of the whole cells : their volume rapidly increased two - fold after hypotonic 255 shocks and then relaxed back , while they rapidly and stably decreased after hypertonic shocks ( Supp Fig 256 1f ) . In prior studies 37 , no change of volume was detected under hypotonic shock probably because of low 257 time resolution . Before osmotic shocks , nuclei occupied 24 % of the total cell volume . Under hypotonic 258 shocks ( 75 % water ) , nuclei represented only 17 % of the total cell volume while under hypertonic shocks 259 ( 1M sucrose ) , nucleus represents 46 % of the total cell volume ( Supp Fig 1g ) . Those observations highlight 260 that cell volume changes are essentially due to cytoplasmic volume changes . 261 GFP concentration 262 To directly measure changes of concentration for a single protein within the cytoplasm , we measured the 263 relative change of ﬂuorescence of cells overexpressing cytosolic GFP over time ( Supp Fig 3f ) . Overall , 264 the dynamics of GFP ﬂuorescence was consistent with that of volume and tension : a fast decrease in 265 ﬂuorescence ( corresponding to volume increase ) followed by a fast recovery after hypotonic shocks ( Supp 266 Fig 3g ) , as opposed to a rapid and stable increase of ﬂuorescence after hypertonic shocks ( Supp Fig 3g ) . 267 As expected , the variation of GFP intensity was always inversely proportional to the volume changes 268 ( Supp Fig 3h ) . 269 Methods and Materials 270 Cell culture 271 Human cervical adenocarcinoma cells HeLa - Kyoto were cultured in DMEM , 4 . 5g / L glucose ( 61965 - 272 026 , Thermoﬁscher ) supplemented with 10 % Fetal Bovine Serum FBS ( 10270 - 106 , Thermoﬁscher ) and 273 1 % Penicillin Streptomycin ( P / S , Life Technologies , Carlsbad , CA , USA ) in a 5 % CO2 incubator ( Thermo 274 Scientiﬁc , Waltham , MA , USA ) . HeLa Kyoto EGFP - LaminB1 / H2B - mCherry cells from cell lines service 275 ( CLS , 330919 ) were used to image the nuclear membrane . Selection pressure for the stably expressed 276 constructs was kept by adding 0 . 5mg / mL of G418 and 0 . 5ug / mL of puromycin in otherwise identical 277 medium as described above . HL - 60 / S4 cells ( ATCC Cat CRL - 3306 ) were cultured in RPMI medium 278 ( ATCC - modiﬁcation ) supplemented with 10 % FBS and 1 % P / S in a 5 % CO2 incubator . For all cell 279 lines , number of passages was kept under 20 . Our cells were authenticated by Microsynth and are 280 mycoplasma - negative , as tested by GATC Biotech and are not on the list of commonly misidentiﬁed cell 281 lines maintained by the International Cell Line Authentication Committee . 282 Apply osmotic shock for live cell imaging 283 Cells were seeded into 35 - mm MatTek glass - bottom microwell dishes and were imaged in Leibovitz 284 medium ( Thermoﬁscher , 21083027 ) supplemented with 10 % Fetal Bovine Serum and 1 % Penicillin 285 Streptomycin . For hypotonic shocks , we simply diluted the cell imaging media with 25 % , 50 % or 75 % of 286 13 / 22 MilliQ water ( 285 mOsm , 200 mOsm , 125 mOsm ) . For hypertonic and isotonic shocks , a stock solution of 287 Leibovitz and sucrose ( 2M ) was diluted to obtain a ﬁnal osmotic pressure of 550 mOsm , 900 mOsm , 1300 288 mOsm , 2000 mOsm and 3500 mOsm as well as additional intermediate solutions ( Supp Fig 1a - b ) . We 289 chose sucrose over salts to avoid changing speciﬁc ion concentrations in the medium . Also , sucrose does 290 not cross the cell membrane , and is not metabolized by HeLa cells . Control hypertonic shocks performed 291 using sorbitol gave identical results ( Supp Fig 5a - b ) . Under the microscope , 1 mL of shock solution was 292 added ( 1 - 2s ) to the imaging dish containing 1mL of isotonic buffer during imaging . Osmotic shocks were 293 applied 10 seconds before the third time point ( 2 min ) . At the end of each experiment , the remaining 294 buffer was collected and its osmotic pressure was measured using an osmometer ( Camlab ) . Since osmotic 295 shocks are applied lived under the microscope , no mixing of the solutions is possible . Using ﬂuorescein , 296 we measured the dilution factor by ﬂuorescence comparing the ﬂuorescence image of the ﬂuorescein 297 solution alone in a dish and the ﬂuorescence of the solution around the cells after added it to 1 mL of 298 medium . As sucrose solutions tend not to mix well with other aqueous solutions and to sediment to the 299 bottom of the imaging chamber , osmolarities of ﬁnal solutions were corrected by this dilution factor to 300 obtain osmolarities to which cells were subjected . 301 Image acquisition and analysis for cell volume measurement 302 Z - stacks were acquired through a spinning - disk confocal composed of a Nikon Ti - E system , a Yokogawa 303 CSU - X1 Confocal Scanner Unit , a iXon camera ( Andor , Belfast , NIR , UK ) , a Laser stack by Intelligent 304 Imaging Innovation Inc ( 3i , Denver , CO , USA ) , a 37 ◦ C incubator ( Life Imaging service , Basel , Switzer - 305 land ) . All images were acquired with Slidebook software ( 3i , Denver , CO , USA ) . In order to measure 306 single cell volume changes through time , HeLa Kyoto cells were labelled with the plasma membrane 307 marker CellMask ( Thermoﬁscher C10046 ) . Dyes were diluted in cell medium at 1 : 1000 , incubated at 308 37 ◦ C for 10 min . Confocal Z - stacks ( 400 nm steps ) were acquired every minute for 10 minutes . Osmotic 309 shocks were applied 10 seconds before the third timepoint . Cell 3D images were segmented using a Matlab 310 home - written code , validated with the Limeseg plugin 59 ( Supp Fig 5b ) and cell volume and area were ex - 311 tracted . Cells were segmented using a 3D watershed with an intensity threshold automatically determined 312 according to the stack pixel distribution of the entire stack . The tracking in time was straightforward since 313 cells are not moving . Code available on https : / / github . com / ChloeRoffay / 3D - segmentation - time - tracking . 314 High - throughput 2D imaging of HL - 60 / S4 cells for volume estimation 315 HL - 60 / S4 cells were collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 180g and resuspended in an osmolarity - 316 adjusted measurement buffer ( MB ) . MB was based on Leibovitz’s L15 medium ( no . 21083027 , Thermo 317 Fisher Scientiﬁc ) supplemented with 10 % heat - inactivated FBS , 1 % penicillin – streptavidin and 0 . 6 % 318 ( wt / vol ) methyl cellulose ( 4 , 000 cPs ; Alfa Aesar ) for increased viscosity that prevents cell sedimentation 319 during the measuremnts . The osmolarity of MB was adjusted by addition of sucrose or by mixing 320 Leibovitz’s / FCS - based MB with water - based MB of same viscosity , and measured before each experiment 321 using a freezing point osmometer ( Fiske 210 Micro - Sample Osmometer , Advanced Instruments ) . 2D 322 14 / 22 bright - ﬁeld cell images were acquired at high throughput using real - time deformability cytometry 40 323 according to previously published procedures 60 . In brief , the cells suspended in MB were introduced to 324 the microﬂuidic chip with a syringe pump . The total ﬂow rate was set to 0 . 16 µ L s − 1 ( 0 . 04 µ L s − 1 sample 325 ﬂow together with 0 . 12 µ L s − 1 focusing sheath ﬂow ) . The time between resuspension of cells and start of 326 the measurement amounted to roughly 2 min , after that few thousand events were recorded every minute 327 to follow the cell volume response over time . Cell images were acquired at the end of a 300 - µ m - long 328 channel with a 30x30 µ m 2 square cross - section at 2 , 000 frames per second using stroboscopic illumination 329 with a pulse duration < 3 µ s to avoid motion blurring . The cell contours were detected in real time and cell 330 area and further parameters were estimated online . Acquired events were ﬁltered for area between 50 – 500 331 µ m 2 to excluded debris and area ratio between 1 . 00 – 1 . 05 to excluded rough or incomplete contours 60 . 332 Volume of the cells was estimated ofﬂine by 360 ◦ rotation of upper and lower halves of the 2D cell 333 contours around the symmetry axis , and averaging the two obtained values 61 using ShapeOut version 1 . 0 . 1 334 ( available at https : / / github . com / ZELLMECHANIK - DRESDEN / ShapeOut ) . 335 Tube pulling experiment 336 Membrane nanotube pulling experiments were performed on the setup published in 62 allowing simulta - 337 neous optical tweezer application , spinning disc confocal and brightﬁeld imaging based on an inverted 338 Nikon eclipse Ti microscope and a 5W 1064nm laser focused through a 100 1 . 3 NA oil objective ( ML5 - 339 CW - P - TKS - OTS , Manlight ) . A membrane nanotube was formed by displacing the cell’s observation 340 chamber away from a concanavalin - A - coated bead ( 3 . 05 mm diameter , Spherotec ) held the optical trap , 341 and previously in contact with the cell to adhere to the cell membrane . The force F exerted on the bead 342 was calculated from Hooke’s law : F = k . x , where k is the stiffness of the trap ( k = 8 . 58 pN . pix − 1 . W − 1 ) 343 and x is the displacement of the bead from its initial zero - force position . 344 Image acquisition and analysis for Flipper - TR imaging 345 Membrane tension measurement were performed on the setup published in 33 . Setup used for imaging is a 346 Nikon Eclipse Ti A1R microscope equipped with a time - correlated single - photon counting module from 347 PicoQuant . Excitation was performed using a pulsed 485 nm laser ( PicoQuant , LDH - D - C - 485 ) operating 348 at 20 MHz , and the emission signal was collected through a 600 / 50 nm bandpass ﬁlter using a gated 349 PMA hybrid 40 detector and a TimeHarp 260 PICO board ( PicoQuant ) . In order to measure membrane 350 tension changes through time , HeLa Kyoto cells were labelled with Flipper - TR ( Spirochrome SC020 ) . 351 Flipper - TR was dissolved in DMSO at 1 mM stock solutions . Cells were labelled with a 1 : 1000 dilution 352 from the DMSO stock , incubated 37 ◦ C for 15 min and slices were acquired every 25 sec for 10 minutes 353 ( Fig 3C ) without washing the probe . Osmotic shocks were applied 10 seconds before the second timepoint . 354 Quality of imaging is altered in DMEM ( with or without FBS , independently of phenol - red ) , such that 355 all images were acquired in Leibovitz for short - term imaging ( less than 2h ) or FluoroBrite ( A1896701 ) 356 for longer times . Lifetimes of Flipper - TR were extracted from FLIM images using SymPhoTime 64 357 software ( PicoQuant ) by ﬁtting ﬂuorescence decay data from all pixels to a dual exponential model after 358 15 / 22 deconvoluting the instrument response function ( calculated by the software ) . We selected full images 359 instead of choosing region of interest because the ﬁtting was mildly affected and the result were more 360 reproducible . The full - width at half - maximum response of the instrument was measured at 176 ps . 361 Refractive index measurement and processing 362 The three - dimensional ( 3D ) refractive index ( RI ) distribution of samples was measured using a custom - 363 made ODT ( Optical Diffraction Tomography ) microscope . The optical setup of ODT employs Mach - 364 Zehnder interferometry in order to measure complex optical ﬁelds of light scattered by samples from 365 various incident angles , as shown in 52 . A coherent laser beam ( wavelength = 532 nm , frequency - doubled 366 Nd - YAG laser , Torus , Laser Quantum , Inc . , UK ) is divided into two beams by a 2x2 single - mode ﬁber 367 optic coupler . One beam is used as a reference beam and the other beam illuminates the specimen on 368 the stage of a custom - made inverted microscope through a tube lens ( f = 175 mm ) and a high numerical 369 aperture ( NA ) objective lens ( NA = 1 . 2 , 63x , water immersion , Carl Zeiss AG , Germany ) . To reconstruct 370 a 3D RI tomogram of samples in a ﬁeld - of - view , the samples are illuminated with 150 various incident 371 angles scanned by a dual - axis galvanomirror ( GVS012 / M , Thorlabs Inc . , USA ) . The diffracted beam from 372 a sample is collected by a high NA objective lens ( NA = 1 . 3 , 100x , oil immersion , Carl Zeiss AG ) and a 373 tube lens ( f = 200 mm ) . The total magniﬁcation is set to be 90 . 5x . The beam diffracted by the sample 374 interferes with the reference beam at the image plane , and generates a spatially modulated hologram . The 375 hologram is recorded with a CCD camera ( FL3 - U3 - 13Y3M - C , FLIR Systems , Inc . , USA ) . From measured 376 holograms , the 3D RI tomograms are reconstructed by the Fourier diffraction theorem employing the 377 ﬁrst - order Rytov approximation 51 , 63 . Cells were manually segmented based on the epiﬂuorescence image 378 of the membrane ( CellMask staining as previously described ) . Cell’s basis was automatically detected to 379 correct the z - drift . By applying the segmented ROI to the projection of the RI tomogram onto the cell’s 380 basis plane , pixels value of RI were extracted , averaged over the entire cell , and averaged over many cells 381 for each osmotic condition . 382 Image acquisition and analysis of the cytoskeleton 383 In order to measure actin or tubulin intensity changes through time , HeLa Kyoto cells were labelled with the 384 plasma membrane marker Cell Mask orange ( Thermoﬁscher C10045 ) and SiR - actin ( SC001 , Spirochrome ) 385 or SiR - tubulin ( SC002 , Spirochrome ) . Dyes were dissolved in DMSO at a stock concentration of 1mM , 386 and diluted 1 : 1000 in cell’s medium , incubated at 37 ◦ C for 20 min to label cells . Cells were then imaged 387 as described above . Cells were manually segmented and average intensity was extracted using ImageJ . 388 Drug treatment 389 Concentrations of drugs was kept constant through the experiment . Cell were initially incubated in culture 390 DMEM with drugs at 37 ◦ C ( see below drugs concentration , incubation time ) . DMEM was replaced by 391 Leibovitz with drugs and CellMask or Flipper - TR . The osmotic shocks were applied as before except 392 that the solution contains the same drugs concentration . The following pharmacological inhibitors and 393 16 / 22 chemical compounds were used : 50 nM Latrunculin A for 1h ( SIGMA L5163 ) , 200 nM Jasplakinolide 394 for 30 min ( ENZO ALX - 350 - 275 ) , 5 µ M Nocodazole for 30 min ( SIGMA M1404 ) , 1 µ M Taxol for 1h 395 ( SIGMA T1912 ) , 100 µ M DCPIB for 30 min ( TOCRIS 1540 ) , 50 µ M EIPA for 30 min ( TOCRIS 3378 ) , 396 100 µ M Bumetamide for 30 min ( SIGMA B3023 ) , 250 nM Torin1 for 30 min ( LC Lab T - 7887 ) and 100 397 nM Rapamycin for 30 min ( LC Lab R - 5000 ) . 398 GFP experiments 399 pGFP was transfected using FuGENE R (cid:13) 6 Transfection Reagent ( E2691 , Promega ) with OptiMEM ( 31985088 , 400 Thermoﬁscher ) . Transfected Hela Kyoto cells were image with the same spinning disk confocal set - up , 401 single confocal planes being acquired every second for 10 minutes . Nikon’s Perfect Focusing System was 402 used to keep focus during the entire osmotic shock . Cells were manually segmented using ImageJ and the 403 mean ﬂuorescence was extracted through time . For each cell , values were normalized to the initial value . 404 All images were constructed using ImageJ . All graphs were constructed with GraphPad Prism 8 . 405 Acknowledgments 406 We thank K .

To account for the experimentally observed relationship between membrane area and tension shown in Fig . 2b of the main text , we assume that a tensionless membrane is not ﬂat . Instead , its curvature is dictated by a collection of protein scaﬀolds of possibly disparate types , including caveolins , other membrane - bound proteins and attachments to the cytoskeleton . As the membrane tension is increased , these “ruﬄes” unfold , increasing the membrane’s projected area . Our model is athermal , as the additional excess membrane area stored in the membrane’s thermal ﬂuctuations is in practice small compared to the areas considered here . The Hamiltonian for the roughened membrane reads H = (cid:90)(cid:90) (cid:110) κ 2 [ ∆ h ( r ) − c 0 ( r ) ] 2 + σ 2 ∇ h ( r ) 2 (cid:111) d 2 r ( 1 ) where h ( r ) is the height function of the membrane . This is the standard Helfrich Hamiltonian in the Monge gauge , except for a spacially varying spontaneous curvature c 0 ( r ) representing the built - in curvature due to membrane - protein interactions . We deﬁne c 0 ( r ) as a random function , reﬂecting the messy character of the static protein - induced membrane ruﬄes . Speciﬁcally , we make it a Gaussian variable with a characteristic correlation length a that ﬁxes the typical size of the ruﬄes . Formally , this reads (cid:104) c 0 ( r ) (cid:105) = 0 ( 2a ) (cid:104) c 0 ( r ) c 0 ( r (cid:48) ) (cid:105) = C 2 exp (cid:18) − | r − r (cid:48) | a (cid:19) ( 2b ) The ﬁrst equation implies a zero mean curvature . This is not a critical assumption however , as setting a non - zero mean curvature does not change the ﬁnal result of our calculation . The constant C gives the typical magnitude of the local curvature . Fourier transforming the two - point correlator yields (cid:104) ˜ c 0 ( q ) ˜ c 0 ( q (cid:48) ) (cid:105) = ( 2 π ) 2 δ ( q + q (cid:48) ) 2 π ( Ca ) 2 [ 1 + ( qa ) 2 ] 3 / 2 , ( 3 ) where q is the modulus of the wavevector q . Minimizing the Hamiltonian with respect to the height function h ( r ) yields the mechanical equilibrium equations for this system . In Fourier space : ˜ h ( q ) = − ˜ c 0 ( q ) q 2 + σ / κ . ( 4 ) We compute the ratio of the real membrane area to the apparent ( projected ) area in the Monge gauge as A real A app ( σ ) = 1 + (cid:28)(cid:90)(cid:90) (cid:20) ∇ h ( r ) 2 2 (cid:21) d 2 r (cid:29) . ( 5 ) Ruffle unfolding – Roﬀay et al . – January 25 , 2021 2 Taking this expression to Fourier space and combining Eqs . ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) ﬁnally yields A real − A app ( σ ) C 2 A app ( σ ) 2 = g ( Σ ) , ( 6 ) where Σ = σa 2 / κ and the function g is given by g ( Σ ) = ( Σ + 2 ) sec − 1 (cid:16) √ Σ (cid:17) − 3 √ Σ − 1 4 ( Σ − 1 ) 5 / 2 . ( 7 ) To ﬁnd the apparent area of the membrane , we solve Eq . ( 6 ) for A app . In the thermodynamic limit , the stored area of the membrane in the zero - tension limit is huge ; in other words C 2 A real → + ∞ . In this limit the area ratio plotted in Fig . 2b simply reads ∆ A A 0 = A app ( σ ) − A app ( σ 0 ) A app ( σ 0 ) = (cid:115) g ( Σ 0 ) g ( Σ ) − 1 = (cid:115) g (cid:0) f 20 / ¯ f 2 (cid:1) g (cid:0) f 2 / ¯ f 2 (cid:1) − 1 , ( 8 ) where σ 0 is some reference tension ( the isotonic value ) and Σ 0 is its dimensionless counterpart . In the last equality we moreover introduce the directly measurable tube force f = 2 π √ 2 κσ , its isotonic value f 0 as well as the characteristic force ¯ f = 2 3 / 2 πκ / a . Using the last expression of Eq . ( 8 ) as a ﬁtting function for the experimentally measured ∆ A / A 0 vs . f 2 curve ( where f 2 is measured post - osmotic shock ) we ﬁnd the following values for our ﬁt parameters : f 0 = 28 pN ( 9a ) ¯ f = 19 pN . ( 9b ) The ﬁt is presented as a line in Fig . 2b . Assuming a bending modulus κ = 20 k B T for the membrane inside the tube , these values yield σ 0 = 1 . 2 × 10 − 4 N · m − 1 ( 10a ) a = 37 nm . ( 10b ) The former value appears pretty typical for a cell membrane tension . The latter value is more informative : the typical size of the membrane ruﬄes is of the order of a few tens of nanometers . One might ﬁnally ask what fraction of the total area is stored in ruﬄes under isotonic conditions . According to the model this quantity reads A real / A app ( σ 0 ) = C (cid:112) g ( Σ 0 ) A real (cid:39) 0 . 19 × (cid:112) C 2 A real . ( 11 ) Since the ﬁt does not specify the value of C 2 A real ( it only assumes it is signiﬁcantly larger than one ) , it cannot answer this question quantitatively . Conversely , if we assume A real / A app ( σ 0 ) = 2 . 5 and use the experimental value A app ( σ 0 ) (cid:39) 775 µ m 2 , we get C − 1 = A app ( σ 0 ) (cid:112) g ( Σ 0 ) / A real (cid:39) 3 µ m , ( 12 ) which makes for fairly shallow ruﬄes , and thus validating our use of the Monge gauge and small - slope expansion of the membrane Hamiltonian .
