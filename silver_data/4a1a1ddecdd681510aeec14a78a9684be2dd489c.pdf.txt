Correlated Random Networks Johannes Berg and Michael La¨ssig Institut fu¨r Theoretische Physik , Universita¨t zu Ko¨ln , Zu¨lpicher Straße 77 , 50937 Ko¨ln , Germany ( Received 16 May 2002 ; published 11 November 2002 ) We develop a statistical theory of networks . A network is a set of vertices and links given by its adjacency matrix c , and the relevant statistical ensembles are deﬁned in terms of a partition function Z (cid:1) P c exp (cid:2)(cid:3) (cid:2) H (cid:4) c (cid:5)(cid:6) . The simplest cases are uncorrelated random networks such as the well - known Erdo¨s - Re´nyi graphs . Here we study more general interactions H (cid:4) c (cid:5) which lead to correlations , for example , between the connectivities of adjacent vertices . In particular , such correlations occur in optimized networks described by partition functions in the limit (cid:2) ! 1 . They are argued to be a crucial signature of evolutionary design in biological networks . DOI : 10 . 1103 / PhysRevLett . 89 . 228701 PACS numbers : 89 . 75 . Hc , 05 . 20 . – y Networks describe structures as diverse as the interac - tion links between proteins in a cell , the wiring of the brain , or the connections of the internet . Recent theoreti - cal work [ 1 , 2 ] has focused on communication networks , and a wealth of quantitative data is now becoming avail - able on networks in molecular biology . Examples include control networks in gene transcription [ 3 ] , the interaction map of proteins [ 4 ] , and the pathways of cell metabolism [ 5 ] . All these systems consist of many different kinds of molecules linked by complex interactions . Network mod - els are a simpliﬁed description , which neglects quantita - tive aspects of these interactions and focuses solely on their pathways . A network is a set of vertices i (cid:1) 1 ; . . . ; N connected by links . It is uniquely deﬁned by the adjacency matrix c , whose entries are c ij (cid:1) 1 if there is a link from i to j and c ij (cid:1) 0 otherwise . We consider here networks with undir - ected links , where c is symmetric . The connectivity or degree of a vertex is then deﬁned as the total number of links connected to it , k i (cid:9) P j c ij . The distance d ij be - tween two vertices i and j is the number of links along the shortest path connecting them [ 6 ] . We assume the vertices are labeled ( for example , by their biochemical identity ) , so that the correspondence between adjacency matrix c and its graph is one - to - one [ 7 ] . Networks with an irregular wiring naturally lend themselves to a statistical description [ 6 ] . We discuss here the equilibrium statistics of networks . The partition function Z can be deﬁned as a sum over all graphs with a ﬁxed number N of vertices and a ﬁxed number M (cid:1) P i < j c ij (cid:1) Tr c 2 = 2 of links Z (cid:1) Y i < j X 1 c ij (cid:1) 0 (cid:13) (cid:4) M (cid:3) Tr c 2 = 2 (cid:5) exp (cid:2)(cid:3) (cid:2) H (cid:4) c (cid:5)(cid:6) : ( 1 ) Averages over this ensemble are denoted by h(cid:11) (cid:11) (cid:11)i . Alternatively , one can deﬁne Z with an arbitrary number of links adjusted by a suitable chemical potential . The ensembles of relevance here have a ﬁnite average con - nectivity (cid:15) (cid:9) 2 M = N . For ﬁxed (cid:15) , the distribution of connectivities , p (cid:4) k (cid:5) (cid:9) 1 N X N i (cid:1) 1 h (cid:13) (cid:4) k i (cid:3) k (cid:5)i ; ( 2 ) becomes asymptotically independent of N , implying that typical adjacency matrices c become sparse for large N . This is the case of interest for applications . A satisfactory mathematical theory exists to date only for what we call uncorrelated random networks [ 9 , 10 ] . In this case , the Hamiltonian depends only on single - point connectivities , H 1 (cid:4) c (cid:5) (cid:1) X N i (cid:1) 1 f (cid:4) k i (cid:5) ; ( 3 ) leading to p (cid:4) k (cid:5) (cid:13) exp (cid:2)(cid:3) (cid:2)f (cid:4) k (cid:5) (cid:3) (cid:18)k (cid:6) = k ! where the con - stant of proportionality is ﬁxed by normalization and (cid:18) is adjusted to give the correct average connectivity . Since all graphs with the same connectivities k 1 ; . . . ; k N have the same statistical weight , this ensemble ensures the maximally random wiring compatible with the distribu - tion p (cid:4) k (cid:5) . The simplest example is the well - known Erdo¨s - Re´nyi graphs , where (cid:2) H (cid:1) 0 and p (cid:4) k (cid:5) is a Poissonian . Many natural networks are , however , not of this type . The simplest kind of correlations occur if the joint dis - tribution of connectivities for neighboring vertices , q (cid:4) k ; k 0 (cid:5) (cid:9) 1 (cid:15)N X N i ; j (cid:1) 1 h (cid:13) (cid:4) k i (cid:3) k (cid:5) c ij (cid:13) (cid:4) k j (cid:3) k 0 (cid:5)i ; ( 4 ) differs from its form for uncorrelated random networks , q 0 (cid:4) k ; k 0 (cid:5) (cid:1) (cid:4) kk 0 = (cid:15) 2 (cid:5) p (cid:4) k (cid:5) p (cid:4) k 0 (cid:5) . Higher correlations can be deﬁned in a similar way [ 11 ] . Connectivity correlations have been found in growth models of communication networks [ 12 , 13 ] as well as in data of genetic and protein networks [ 14 , 15 ] . These observations call for a statistical theory of more general ensembles called correlated random networks , which is the subject of this Letter . The ensembles of interest are characterized by ﬁnite distributions p (cid:4) k (cid:5) and q (cid:4) k ; k 0 (cid:5) in the limit of large N . One then expects a universal logarithmic scaling of the average distance d ij between vertices , P i ; j h d ij i = N 2(cid:11) (cid:13) log N (cid:11) , in any V OLUME 89 , N UMBER 22 P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 25 N OVEMBER 2002 228701 - 1 0031 - 9007 = 02 = 89 ( 22 ) = 228701 ( 4 ) $ 20 . 00  2002 The American Physical Society 228701 - 1 connected component (cid:11) with N (cid:11) nodes [ 16 ] . This is consistent with our numerical ﬁndings . Hence , correlated random networks maintain a sparse connectivity matrix and are locally treelike . The ‘‘inverse temperature’’ (cid:2) in ( 1 ) measures the deviation from Erdo¨s - Re´nyi graphs . Quite remarkably , these structural properties are pre - served in the limit (cid:2) ! 1 , where we obtain nontrivial optimized networks . Ensembles of this kind generically have strong correlations . The simplest type of Hamiltonian producing correla - tions has nearest - neighbor connectivity interactions , H 2 (cid:4) c (cid:5) (cid:1) X i < j c ij g (cid:4) k i ; k j (cid:5) ; ( 5 ) where g (cid:4) k ; k 0 (cid:5) is some function of the connectivities . The resulting class of graph ensembles can be seen as a show - case for correlated random networks where analytic ex - pressions can be derived . Higher order correlations are generated by Hamiltonians with next - nearest neighbor interactions , etc . , We also study a Hamiltonian H (cid:1) H 1 (cid:15) (cid:21) H d with a nonlocal part , H d (cid:4) c (cid:5) (cid:1) X N i < j d ij ; ( 6 ) often called the diameter of the graph . For (cid:21) > 0 and a suitable scaling (cid:21) (cid:13) 1 = (cid:4) N log N (cid:5) , this Hamiltonian is found to generate compactiﬁed networks with ﬁnite p (cid:4) k (cid:5) and q (cid:4) k ; k 0 (cid:5) , provided the extra term H 1 stabilizes the network against collapse to a star . Compactiﬁed networks occur in communication and transport [ 17 ] , and may play a role in biology [ 18 , 19 ] . For example , distance - optimized networks obtained from ( 6 ) show an abundance of high - connectivity vertices ( hubs ) which are preferentially connected to peripheral vertices of low connectivity . A very similar structure ( with even more pronounced hubs ) can also be obtained from local interactions of the form ( 5 ) . Typical graphs are shown in Fig . 1 . To establish these results , we ﬁrst discuss the analytical treatment of local interactions , choosing a generic Hamiltonian of the form H (cid:1) H 1 (cid:15) H 2 given by ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) . From the partition function ( 1 ) , the free energy is derived by using an integral representation for the con - straints due to the connectivity k i at each vertex and making a Hubbard - Stratonovich transformation . The re - sulting integral can be evaluated in a saddle - point ap - proximation , yielding the reduced free energy per vertex in the thermodynamic limit , (cid:3) (cid:2)f (cid:9) lim N ! 1 1 N log Z (cid:1) (cid:15) 2log N (cid:15) (cid:15) 2 (cid:4) log (cid:15) (cid:3) 1 (cid:5)(cid:3) (cid:15) 2log (cid:4)X k ; k 0 Q k G (cid:3) 1 kk 0 Q k 0 (cid:15) e (cid:3) 2 (cid:18) (cid:5) (cid:15) log " X k (cid:4) Q k (cid:15) e (cid:3) (cid:18) (cid:5) k k ! exp (cid:2)(cid:3) (cid:2)f (cid:4) k (cid:5)(cid:6) # : ( 7 ) The ‘‘order parameters’’ Q k and the chemical poten - tial (cid:18) have to be determined self - consistently from the saddle - point condition . This form is closely related to a ﬁeld - theoretic approach [ 10 , 20 , 21 ] , where networks ap - pear as the Feynman diagrams of a Gaussian integral with a propagator matrix G kk 0 (cid:1) exp (cid:2)(cid:3) (cid:2)g (cid:4) k ; k 0 (cid:5)(cid:6) (cid:3) 1 and interactions as speciﬁed by the last term in ( 7 ) . Notice the superextensive scaling of the entropy , (cid:4) (cid:15) = 2 (cid:5) log N , which reﬂects that unlike in a regular lattice , each vertex can be connected to all N (cid:3) 1 other vertices . The last term in ( 7 ) is directly related to the degree distribution , p (cid:4) k (cid:5) (cid:1) C (cid:4) Q k (cid:15) e (cid:3) (cid:18) (cid:5) k k ! exp (cid:2)(cid:3) (cid:2)f (cid:4) k (cid:5)(cid:6) ; ( 8 ) where C is a normalization constant . For example , a power - law tail in p (cid:4) k (cid:5) may be generated by a suitable choice of the weights f (cid:4) k (cid:5) but it is not generic . A more detailed account of networks with generic local interactions will be published elsewhere [ 8 ] . Here we turn to the simplest Hamiltonian with local interactions producing nontrivial optimized net - works , see Fig . 1 . It has the form H L (cid:1) H 1 (cid:15) H 2 with H 1 (cid:4) c (cid:5) (cid:1) (cid:3)(cid:4) 1 = 2 (cid:5) P i k 2 i (cid:15) (cid:26) P i k 3 i and H 2 (cid:4) c (cid:5) (cid:1) (cid:27) P i < j (cid:13) k i ; 1 c ij (cid:13) k j ; 1 . The ﬁrst term (cid:4) 1 = 2 (cid:5) P i k 2 i (cid:1) (cid:4) 1 = 2 (cid:5) P ijk c ik c kj gives the number of paths of length two on the graph . It rewards the formation of hubs , i . e . , highly connected vertices , which in turn lead to short distances . In fact this term has the maximally compact , starlike conﬁguration as its ground state . The collapse to a star , where the connectivity of the central vertex scales with the size of the graph , however , is prevented by the regu - larization term (cid:26) P i k 3 i . The correlation term H 2 with (cid:27) ! 1 suppresses single , isolated links connecting two vertices of connectivity 1 . Without this term an extensive FIG . 1 . Optimized networks , obtained from local interac - tions ( left ) and nonlocal interactions for large (cid:2) . Hubs of high connectivity ( solid circles ) are preferentially connected to peripheral vertices of low connectivity ( open circles ) .

A minimal connectivity of 1 of each vertex is enforced . For this Hamiltonian , the free energy ( 7 ) con - tains only one nonzero order parameter Q 1 given by p (cid:4) 1 (cid:5) (cid:1) (cid:15) (cid:2) Q 1 = (cid:4) Q 1 (cid:3) e (cid:3) (cid:18) (cid:5)(cid:6) . The chemical potential (cid:18) is determined by P k kp (cid:4) k (cid:5) (cid:1) (cid:15) . Remarkably , the connec - tivity correlation can be obtained from H 2 and single - vertex quantities , q (cid:4) k ; k 0 (cid:5) (cid:13) kp (cid:4) k (cid:5) t k k 0 p (cid:4) k 0 (cid:5) t k 0 exp (cid:2)(cid:3) (cid:2)g (cid:4) k ; k 0 (cid:5)(cid:6) : ( 9 ) The constant of proportionality is ﬁxed by normalization and the t k are determined by the marginal distribution P k 0 q (cid:4) k ; k 0 (cid:5) (cid:1) kp (cid:4) k (cid:5) = (cid:15) , giving t 1 (cid:1) (cid:15) = f T (cid:2) (cid:15) (cid:3) p (cid:4) 1 (cid:5)(cid:6)g and t k (cid:1) T (cid:1) (cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8)(cid:8) 1 (cid:3) p (cid:4) 1 (cid:5) 2 = (cid:2) (cid:15) (cid:3) p (cid:4) 1 (cid:5)(cid:6) 2 p for k > 1 . The properties of optimized networks resulting from the Hamiltonian H L are readily inferred from Eqs . ( 8 ) and ( 9 ) . At ﬁnite values (cid:2) one ﬁnds that the degree distribution ( 8 ) has an exponentially decaying tail . In order to analyze the limit (cid:2) ! 1 , we replace the sum over k in ( 7 ) by an integral . One ﬁnds that the vertices arrange themselves into hubs of connectivity k (cid:18) (cid:1) (cid:4) 1 (cid:3) 2 (cid:26) (cid:5) = 4 (cid:26) ( 10 ) and peripheral vertices of connectivity 1 . The peripheral vertices are connected only to hubs , while the hubs form an uncorrelated random network . A remarkably similar structure is found for compacti - ﬁed networks generated by the Hamiltonian with non - local interactions H (cid:1) H 1 (cid:15) (cid:21)H d with H d given by ( 6 ) and H 1 (cid:1) (cid:26) P i k 3 i . For (cid:21) > 0 , the nonlocal part H d favors networks with short distances , while H 1 prevents the collapse to a star as before . Hence , by choosing (cid:21) (cid:1) 2 = (cid:4) N log N (cid:5) , one obtains a well - deﬁned thermodynamic limit with the average distance between vertices scaling as log N . We have studied this ensemble , as well as the case of local interactions H L , by a Monte - Carlo link dynamics . Starting , for example , from an Erdo¨s - Renyi graph , randomly chosen links are moved to previ - ously unlinked vertex pairs with probability p (cid:1) min (cid:4) 1 ; exp (cid:2)(cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:20) H (cid:6)(cid:5) where (cid:20) H denotes the corre - sponding change in the Hamiltonian . The minimum de - gree of 1 is enforced throughout , self - links are excluded [ 7 ] . No dependence on the initial conditions has been found . For the local Hamiltonian we use a network with N (cid:1) 200 , (cid:15) (cid:1) 2 : 4 , (cid:26) (cid:1) 0 : 03 , for the nonlocal Hamiltonian we use N (cid:1) 100 , (cid:15) (cid:1) 2 : 4 , (cid:26) (cid:1) 0 : 001 . We averaged over 100 samples . Figure 2 juxtaposes analytical and numerical results for local interactions on the left with numerical results for nonlocal interactions on the right . The connectivity distribution p (cid:4) k (cid:5) shows the for - mation of high - connectivity hubs in both cases . For local interactions the hub connectivity is given by ( 10 ) , for nonlocal interaction the distribution re - mains broad even in the limit (cid:2) ! 1 [ Fig . 2 ( a ) ] [ 22 ] . 2 4 6 8 k 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 2 4 6 8 k Pk 1 3 5 7 1 3 5 7 0 . 020 . 04 3 5 7 1 3 5 1 3 5 7 1 3 5 7 0 . 020 . 04 3 5 7 1 3 5 7 0 5 10 β 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 5 10 15 β S q ( k , k ' ) 0 5 10 β 0 . 8 1 . 0 1 . 2 1 . 4 5 10 15 β K ( a ) ( c ) ( d ) ( b ) FIG . 2 ( color online ) .

The deviation from uncorrelated random networks is measured by the relative entropy S (cid:4) q j q 0 (cid:5) (cid:1) P k ; k 0 q (cid:4) k ; k 0 (cid:5) log (cid:2) q (cid:4) k ; k 0 (cid:5) = q 0 (cid:4) k ; k 0 (cid:5)(cid:6) . In a single network of size N , we obtain the estimate S (cid:4) ^ qq j ^ qq 0 (cid:5) from the observed frequencies ^ qq (cid:4) k ; k 0 (cid:5) and ^ pp (cid:4) k (cid:5) , with ^ qq 0 (cid:4) k ; k 0 (cid:5) (cid:1) (cid:4) kk 0 = (cid:15) 2 (cid:5) ^ pp (cid:4) k (cid:5) ^ pp (cid:4) k 0 (cid:5) . We then generate a sufﬁ - cient number of uncorrelated random networks [ 23 ] labeled by " with frequencies ^ qq " (cid:4) k ; k 0 (cid:5) and sampling entropies S (cid:4) ^ qq " j ^ qq 0 (cid:5) ; their average and standard deviation are denoted by S 0 (cid:4) ^ qq 0 (cid:5) and (cid:20) S 0 (cid:4) ^ qq 0 (cid:5) , respectively . Connectivity correlations in the original network are signiﬁcant if S (cid:4) ^ qq j ^ qq 0 (cid:5) (cid:3) S 0 (cid:4) ^ qq 0 (cid:5) * (cid:20) S 0 (cid:4) ^ qq 0 (cid:5) . This is typi - cally the case from a certain optimization degree (cid:2) on , as shown by the ensemble averages over ten samples h S (cid:4) ^ qq j ^ qq 0 (cid:5)i , h S 0 (cid:4) ^ qq 0 (cid:5)i , and h (cid:20) S 0 (cid:4) ^ qq 0 (cid:5)i of Fig . 2 ( c ) . Both kinds of networks become more compactiﬁed with increasing (cid:2) , as shown by the average inverse dis - tance K (cid:9) (cid:2) 2 = N (cid:4) N (cid:3) 1 (cid:5)(cid:6) P i < j d (cid:3) 1 ij [ Fig . 2 ( d ) ] [ 24 ] . We also plot K for the equivalent uncorrelated random net - works ; no such compactiﬁcation is seen . Hence , the one - point distribution p (cid:4) k (cid:5) may miss important functional properties . On the other hand , the nonlocally interacting networks and their equivalent locally interacting counter - parts [ constructed to have the same p (cid:4) k (cid:5) and q (cid:4) k ; k 0 (cid:5) ] have a very similar degree of compactiﬁcation [ 23 ] . This illustrates how optimization induces correlations . In summary , we have shown how interactions shape the structure of a network . Hamiltonians beyond the ‘‘single - vertex’’ form ( 3 ) generate correlations such as a neighbor connectivity distribution q (cid:4) k ; k 0 (cid:5) which differs from that in uncorrelated networks . Higher correlations can be de - ﬁned in a similar way [ 11 ] . These correlations provide a more detailed ﬁngerprint of the interactions present than the single - point connectivity distribution p (cid:4) k (cid:5) . This ob - servation should carry over to the dynamical rules for nonequilibrium ensembles such as the well - known growth models [ 1 , 12 ] . In transcription control networks , structural motifs have been identiﬁed that can be expressed in terms of connectivity correlations [ 14 ] . Such correlations have also been observed in protein networks [ 15 ] . In view of our ﬁndings for optimized networks , they appear to be a natural consequence of the underlying dynamics and functional optimization . We expect the data to give im - portant information on the underlying design principles of networks and on the selective forces governing their evolution . Reverse engineering seems feasible , with the aim of inferring the relevant dynamics from the data . The nonequilibrium theory of correlated random networks will thus be an important avenue for future research .

[ 21 ] This correspondence is strictly valid only in the thermo - dynamic limit , where tadpole diagrams and multiple contractions between the same pair of vertices can be neglected . [ 22 ] The parameters (cid:26) were chosen such that the third mo - ment of the degree distribution h k 3 i is the same for the two ensembles in the limit of large (cid:2) . [ 23 ] There is an efﬁcient algorithm to produce an equivalent uncorrelated random network from a given network : Choose two edges connecting the pairs of vertices i ; j and k ; l at random with uniform probability and rewire them as i ; k and j ; l . Repeating this procedure sufﬁciently many times leaves p (cid:4) k (cid:5) invariant but destroys all higher correlations . It has been used in Ref . [ 15 ] for protein networks . Similarly , the equivalent locally corre - lated network is obtained by swapping only links with k i (cid:1) k l and k j (cid:1) k l , which leaves p (cid:4) k (cid:5) and q (cid:4) k ; k 0 (cid:5) in - variant but destroys all higher correlations . [ 24 ] This form is chosen since it remains well deﬁned even for disconnected components . V OLUME 89 , N UMBER 22 P H Y S I C A L R E V I E W L E T T E R S 25 N OVEMBER 2002 228701 - 4 228701 - 4
