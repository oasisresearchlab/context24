Creativity Support Systems An Empirical Examination of the Value of Creativity Support Systems on Idea Generation By : Brenda Massetti St . John’s University 300 Howard Avenue Staten Island , NY 10301 U . S . A . Massetti @ sjuvm . stjohns . edu Abstract Because organizations seek more innovative ways to compete , the ability of their employees to generate new and valuable ideas becomes a fundamental survival skill . To the extent that computer software might enhance the creative performance of individual users , organizations might ultimately apply such tools to enhance the creative performance of their employees . A con - trolled laboratqry experiment was performed to determine whether two popular creativity sup - port applications significantly enhanced the cre - ative performance of individual users . The results suggest that responses generated with software support are significantly more novel and valuable than responses generated by pen and paper . The results also question the previ - ous creativity research practice of not directly controlling for idea fluency prior to experimental manipulation . It is hoped the findings from this investigation can be used to improve individual creative performance , further research concern - ing factors relevant to creativity , and guide future ICSS development efforts .

Consequently , creativity has evolved into a fun - damental organizational resource useful in establishing and maintaining competitive advan - tage ( Coulson and Strickland , 1991 ; Everett , 1983 ; Gillam , 1993 ; Kiechel , 1983 ) . Organizations such as Microsoft and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing , for example , claim that cultivating creativity within their members has led to innovations otherwise not possible ( LaBarre , 1994 ; Morgan , 1993 ) . Moreover , between 1988 and 1992 , the number of firms offering creativity training programs has increased eightfold to 33 percent ( Thierauf , 1993 ) . With industry leaders such as International Business Machines , Banc One , and Exxon Corporation regularly expending cor - porate dollars to nurture the creative spirit of their members , techniques aimed at enhancing creativity are flourishing ( Couger , 1995 ; de Bono , 1993 ; Evans , 1991 ) . One relatively new set of tools intended to aug - ment the creative process is Creativity Support Systems ( CSS ) ( Abraham and Boone , 1994 ) . These computer - based tools are generally aimed at enhancing boundary - breaking , insight - ful thought during problem solving ( Evans , 1991 ; VanGundy , 1992 ; Winship , 1991 ) . For example , some CSSs provide open - ended question - and - answer options for generating new points of view , while others provide more focused structures for exploring ideas ( Marakas and Elam , forthcoming ) . In addition , some pack - ages are designed to support individuals , while others are intended for group - oriented use ( Dayton , 1991 ; Young , 1989 ) . Although the popularity of CSSs for individual use appears to be growing , only a few con - MIS Quarterly ~ March 1996 83 Creativity Support Systems trolled examinations exploring their value have been performed ( Rouse , 1989 ; Winship , 1991 ) . For example , Proctor ( 1989 ) found that of 170 subjects using Individual - Level Creativity Support Systems ( ICSS ) , over 50 percent claimed to have generated at least one useful insight not considered prior to using the ICSS . However , Proctor’s investigation also found that a significant number of the subjects Were not enthusiastic about the software . In addition , reseamh by Watson ( 1989 ) and Roberts ( 1989 ) determined that students using an ICSS were able to generate more ideas faster than stu - dents brainstorming without software . While these findings have merit given the notion that a novel idea is more likely to emerge from many rather than fewer ideas , neither study directly considered the quality of ideas generated . Notwithstanding the lack of clear empirical evi - dence concerning the value of an ICSS , there is also little theoretical justification ( Abraham and Boone , 1994 ; Elam and Mead , 1990 ) . Each ICSS appears to provide a different methodolo - gy for enhancing creativity with little more than anecdotal reasoning to justify the approach ( Cohen , 1991 ; Young , 1989 ) . However , if ICSS were to directly enhance creative perfor - mance , the organizational benefits could be multifaceted . For example , organizational members could use the ICSS for reinforcing techniques learned in formal creativity training . Or , by matching ICSS tools to specific decision needs , the ICSS might enable management to better control creative performance . An organi - zational member unable to think in alternative ways on a particular issue might use the pattern switching or association tools of an ICSS to respond more variably . To better understand the value of using an ICSS , this paper proposes a theoretical model reflecting a variety of factors believed directly relevant to an individual’s creative performance . Hypotheses concerning the effects of ICSSs on creative performance are derived and investi - gated using a controlled laboratory experiment . Theoretical foundation of the ICSS Formally , an individual has performed creatively to the extent that the response produced is not only novel , but also meaningful and valuable for a given situation ( de Bono , 1993 ; VanGundy , 1982 ) . Conceptually , the extent to which one performs creatively is influenced by a variety of social , cultural , and historical factors ( Ackoff and Vergara , 1981 ; Albert , 1983 ; Amabile and Tighe , 1993 ; Couger , 1995 ; Tardif and Sternberg , 1988 ) . Within any given environ - ment , however , additional factors such as indi - vidual ability , the nature of the decision task , the amount of training , and the technology used could also affect creative performance ( Elam and Mead , 1990 ; Evans , 1991 ; Torrance , 1988 ; Young , 1989 ) . A graphical depiction of these proposed relationships can be found in Figure 1 . Qualities relevant to an individual’s creative ability include physiological characteristics of the brain ( Restak , 1993 ) ; distinctive cognitive characteristics ( Guilford , 1968 ) ; and special motivational considerations ( Csikszentmihaly , 1988 ; Haines and Amabile , 1988 ) . Generally , an individual’s natural creative potential is bio - logically determined and established early in life . It is thought to directly affect creative perfor - mance and is not expected to vary significantly over time ( Amabile , 1991 ; Cox , 1983 ; Torrance , 1988 ) . Through training , however , an individual’s cre - ative performance can be amplified or inhibited ( de Bono , 1993 ; VanGundy , 1982 ; Walberg , 1988 ; ) . Creativity training represents the individ - ual’s past knowledge and developmental history concerning his / her creative behavior ( Couger , 1995 ; Finke , et al . , 1992 ; Jacobs , 1989 ) . Depending upon the individual’s background and training with respect to decision making , creative behavior may become more or less pronounced over time ( Tardif and Sternberg , 1988 ; Walberg , 1988 ) . The nature of the decision task is another factor that affects creative performance ( Elam and Mead , 1990 ; VanGundy , 1992 ) . Categorically , creative responses result from two types of mental processes : generative and exploratory ( Finke , et al . , 1992 ) . Within the generative 84 MIS Quarter / v / March 1996 Creativity Support Systems CreativityTraining IndividualCreativeAbility C reative Performance DecisionTask ICSS Technology Figure 1 . Theoritical Model of the Relationship Between Individual Creativity Support Systems and Creative Performance mode , divergent ways of thinking , including remote association and pattern switching , pro - duce novel , unique concepts ( Ackoff and Vergara , 1981 ; de Bono , 1993 ; Young , 1989 ) . In the exploratory mode , convergent thought such as elaboration or successive refinement reformulates a unique concept into a meaning - ful and valuable response ( Ackoff and Vergara , 1981 ; Guilford , 1968 ; VanGundy , 1982 ) . While both processes must occur for an individual to perform creatively ( Guilford , 1968 ; Tardif and Sternberg , 1988 ) , the nature of the decision task defines which mode is likely to dominate response formation ( Finke , et al . , 1992 ) . Depending on whether the stated task is aimed at the generative or exploratory mode , the response produced would tend to be more novel or useful . 1991 ; Young , 1989 ) . Theoretically , they influ - ence performance by providing the necessary suggestions and cues for an individual to pro - duce a creative response ( Robbin , 1990 ) . Moreover , these tools are believed to ward off debilitating distractions by focusing the individu - al’s thoughts toward creativity ( Cohen , 1991 ; Finn , 1993 ) . However , while arguments suggest ICSSs ultimately enhance creative perfor - mance , it is also possible they have no impact or a negative impact on creativity . For example , operating a computer may make an individual so emotionally uncomfortable that his / her ability to think in any fashion is limited . Hypotheses formation ICSSs are also thought to directly contribute to an individual’s creative performance ( Evans , Because creative performance has previously been operationalized in a variety of ways , it is MIS Quarterly ~ March 1996 85 Crea ~ vity Support Systems useful to consider the expected impacts of ICSSs from multiple perspectives . One way is to consider the effect of ICSSs on idea fluency ( Diehl and Stroebe , 1987 ; Young , 1989 ) o Idea fluency refers to an individual’s ability to gener - ate a number of different ideas in response to a specific decision task ( Guilford , 1968 ; Saletta , 1978 ) . It is typically considered an objective , quantitative measure of creative performance and is widely used as a dependent variable in brainstorming research ( Ackoff . and Vergara , 1981 ; Couger , 1995 ; Roberts , 1989 ; Watson , 1989 ) . Since ICSSs are specifically designed to provide cues that heighten an individual’s cre - ative performance , and idea fluency is consid - ered an aspect of that performance , the follow - ing hypothesis is suggested . HI : Use of ICSS technology will result in a greater number of ideas being pro - duced for a given decision task than use of conventional software support or no software support . Beyond providing mental triggers for quantita - tively enhancing creative thought , an ICSS should also be capable of qualitatively improv - ing creative performance . Not only would one expect more ideas to be produced from using an ICSS , but one would also expect these ideas to be more original and valuable than ideas pro - duced by some other means . A formal state - ment reflecting this notion follows , H2 : Use of ICSS technology will result in more creative ideas being produced for a given decision task than use of conventional software support or no software support . To the extent that a computer program can sup - port creative thought , it theoretically has the potential to enhance creative performance in a precise way . Specifically , an ICSS focused on generative thinking ( e . g . , viewing a situation in completely different way ) should be able to spawn more novel responses than an ICSS focused on exploratory thinking’ ( e . g . , succes - sively refining an established perspective ) . And , an ICSS that emphasizes exploratory thought over generative should produce creative outputs containing more situational value than novelty . Hypotheses to reflect these implied relationships follow . H3 : Use of a generative ICSS application will produce ideas for a given decision task that are more novel than those produced by an exploratory ICSS , con - ventional software support , or no soft - ware support . H4 : Use of an exploratory ICSS application will produce ideas for a given decision task that are more valuable than those produced by a generative ICSS , con - ventional software support , or no soft - ware support . Methodology The experiment entailed a 1 x 4 design where subjects completed the same task using one of four treatments : generative IOS $ , exploratory ICSS , conventional software , and no software . Creativity training was held constant , and indi - vidual ability was monitored through testing before and after experimentation . The subjects’ task responses were rated on creative merit by experts in the task domain . Details concerning subjects , software , variables , and procedures are provided in the following paragraphs . Subjects The subjects were 44 MBA students taking a graduate course in management information systems at a large metropolitan university . All were employed in a full - or part - time capacity . They volunteered to participate and were ran - domly assigned to treatments after receiving creativity training . None were familiar with any of the software applications used prior to receiv - ing their respective treatments , But , all already knew how to operate a computer for word pro - cessing and spreadsheeting purposes . 86 MIS Quarterly ~ March 1996 Creativity Support Systems Software selection There were three different types of software used in the experiment . One , IdeaFisher , was selected to represent an ICSS with a generative focus . This software contained an idea bank with over 705 , 000 possible associations of topics , phrases , and words ( Robbin , 1990 ) . Using the idea bank , an individual could support the processes of divergent thinking and remote association by browsing through and pondering the listed topics and ideas . In addition , IdeaFisher provided a question bank of over 3 , 000 questions designed to support thought processes such as flexibility , memory retrieval , and pattern switching . While IdeaFisher did not claim to inhibit exploratory thought , the main thrust of the software appeared to focus on tools to generate novel ideas . The second , Ideatree , was selected to represent an ICSS with an exploratory focus . Rather than ask open - ended questions or offer lists of generic ideas , this package provided a means for users to embellish , emphasize , and polish ideas . Specifically , the software enabled a user to type concepts into " idea - boxes , " which could then be linked laterally or hierarchically . While the boxes had a limit on the space available for phrasing , the user was free to append additional comments to any idea - box through a word - processing option ( Cohen , 1991 ) . Although Ideatree did not actively inhibit generative thought , it focused on detailing , arranging , and coordinating ideas to make them more meaningful and valuable . The third , Harvard Graphics , was used as a soft - ware - control mechanism for any impacts that may result simply from computer use and not creativity support . This conventional application was selected because it mimicked some features offered in formal ICSSs . For example , it readily allowed users to create and arrange boxes , charts , and text - based outputs . operationalized into idea fluency , novelty , value , and a creative performance score . Fluency was defined as the number of ideas generated by each subject . Novelty was defined as the extent to which each response was rated as new , unique , and different . Value was defined as the extent to which each response was rated as real - istic or worthwhile . And the creative performance score was generated by averaging novelty and value ratings across subjects’ responses . A creativity inventory ( from Hellriegel and Slocum , 1991 ) was given to each subject before and after the experiment . The inventory consist - ed of 36 items designed to assess an individual’s perceived self - confidence , need for individuality , abstract thinking ability , analysis capability , desire for task achievement , and degree of envi - ronmental control . Because these . have been consistently cited as characteristics of a creative person ( Amabile and Tighe , 1993 ; Barron and Harrington , 1981 ; Tardif and Sternberg , 1988 ; Torrance , 1988 ) , the inventory appeared to pro - vide a general determination of each subject’s ability to perform creatively . Besides having face validity , the inventory seemed relatively simple to administer . It was split into two 18 - question instruments so that three questions about each characteristic were present on each version . The response options were constructed so that higher scores reflected individuals more predisposed to perform creatively . A software satisfaction survey was also given to each subject in the software treatments . The survey consisted of 11 items constructed to determine a subject’s attitude toward computers ( four items ) ; deference toward the software used ( two items ) ; sense of the software’s applicability and decision support ( three items ) ; and percep - tion of its ease - of - use and operability ( two items ) . The survey also contained two open - ended questions to gather additional opinions about the software each subject used . Variables and measures The independent variable manipulated was the type of creativity support each individual used to generate creative responses . The dependent variable was the subjects’ creative performance on a decision task . Creative performance was Decision task The task required subjects to devise solutions to the homeless problem faced by cities and soci - ety . This task was chosen based on Haines and Amabile ( 1988 ) , which suggested that MIS Quarterly / March 1996 87 Creativity Support Systems decrease the potential for response bias , tasks requiring no specific knowledge or training should be used in creativity experimentation . Because homelessness reflects a problem that any person living in a large metropolitan area would have general awareness of and one where common knowledge would suffice for solution formation , the task seemed to meet these crite - ria . In addition , the task seemed distinctive enough to hold the subjects’ attention but indefi - nite enough to support generative and explorato - ry thought equally well ( Finke , et al ~ , 1992 ) . Judges The judges were selected for their expertise in governmental policy issues such as homeless - ness . One was an attorney specializing in human rights , and the other was a former com - munity council president with a master’s degree in public administration . The judges made their assessments independently and rated the ideas relative to each other rather than to a standard they might hold from , their work domains . Expert - level performance standards are typically too high for members of the general population to consistently meet ( Amabile and Tighe , 1993 ) . Therefore , a negative rating bias might be intro - duced if an expert were to apply a domain - deter - mined standard . The judges were asked to rate each idea on a scale of one ( no merit for the fac - tor ) to 10 ( maximum merit for the factor ) . Experimental procedures The experiment occurred over two sessions . In Session 1 , the creativity training session , sub - jects were given an introduction in how to think more creatively . The session began with a lec - ture on how important creativity is for business decision making . Examples of how organizations have used creativity to become more successful were given . Subjects were also given a descrip - tion of how the creative process occurs and were made aware of biases both individuals and orga - nizations have with respect to creativity . Ways to overcome these obstacles were suggested , and discussion was encouraged . The session lasted approximately an hour and included one exercise in brainstorming and one in elaboration . The purpose of the session was to establish a consis - tent knowledge base conceming creativity . After the discussion , each subject was given the first half of the creativity inventory to determine his / her baseline ability to respond creatively . The preinventory measure was given at the end of the training session so that a distinction could later be made between training and experimental effects . Had the preinventory been given before training , establishing whether training or treatment pro - duced a given outcome would be difficult . The second session occurred one week after the first . In Session 2 , subjects in each software treatment received an initial overview of how their application functioned . Specifically , the idea and question bank features of IdeaFisher ( novel - thought support tools ) were taught subjects in the generative treatment . Subjects in the exploratory treatment were taught the idea - box and note - pad options of Ideatree ( refining - thought support tools ) . And conventional sub - jects received instruction in the organization chart and text - writing options of Harvard Graphics because these features appeared to mimic the ICSS box and screen features . The software applications were menu - driven , offered online help , and appeared straightfor - ward to use . For example , to use the idea bank feature in IdeaFisher , one would highlight listed ideas and then copy them to a supporting " screen - pad " with the click of a mouse . No spe - cific creativity training examples were used in Session 2 . But , various suggestions for how to use the chosen functions were taken from each application’s training manual . The training for each software application took approximately 40 minutes to complete . When a subject acknowledged comfort in operating the features pertinent to his / her application , that subject was given a sheet of paper containing the decision task . Subjects were told to generate as many different ideas as possible in the period allotted using the software they had just learned . Subjects in the control treatment were each given a pen , blank paper , and the sheet contain - ing the assigned task . They , too , were told to generate as many different ideas as possible in the timeframe allotted . All subjects in all treat - 88 MIS Quarterly ~ March 1996 Creativity Support Systems ments were allowed 30 minutes to complete the assigned task . All subjects were allowed to ask questions concerning the tools they used such as " How do I change screens ? " for the software treatments , or " Can I write on the back of the paper ? . " for the control treatment . Tool - focused questions were allowed to subvert confusion effects that might occur from subjects not remembering how to use their applications . But no questions concerning the assigned task were allowed . At the end of the allotted time , subjects were asked to either save their ideas on disk or turn them in on paper . All subjects then complet - ed the second half of the creativity inventory , and subjects in the software treatments also completed the software satisfaction survey . Data compilation techniques Once the experiment was complete , the subjects’ ideas were typed into a common word - processing format . A common format was used so that any visual differences in the outputs generated ( such ¯ as handwriting or font style ) would not influence the judges’ decisions . The process of differentiat - ing ideas from the responses given by the sub - jects occurred as follows . For the most part , the subjects either numbered their ideas , separated them by spacing between blocks of text , placed them into different boxes with any text - based elaboration attached on the electronic note - pad , or simply used phraseology such as " another idea would be . " Where a response contained a lengthy explication of similar content or was not distinctly separated , the entire response was included as a single idea . Given that the judges were experts capable of appropriately assessing any elabora - tion and that nuances in word and grammar choice more accurately reflect a respondent’s true intention , the ideas were transcribed as written with only spelling errors and basic punctuation corrected . Moreover , because the judges were asked to rate the ideas relative to one another , all ideas , even those of one subject that may have appeared similar in content to the ideas of anoth - er subject , were given to the judges . Each expert was given a list of 149 ideas and asked to rate each on novelty and value . Two ver - sions of the idea lists , one the reverse order of the other , were used so that fatigue or leaming effects could be detected . The experts were provided as much time as they wanted and were encouraged to take breaks to avoid fatigue . Because so many ideas were generated , and because the experts were professionals with pressing responsibilities outside the cause of research , they only went through the rating process once . Results Because of the volume of data analyzed , the results have been divided into the following sec - tions : Creative Ability , Judges’ Reliability , Idea Fluency , Creative Performance , Generative and Exploratory Support , and Software Satisfaction . A summary of the statistics used for testing the hypotheses can be found in Table 1 . Creative ability A formal extreme - scores test revealed that one pair of inventory scores from the control treatment was an outlier ( Hildebrand and Ott , 1991 ) . After viewing this subject’s responses to both versions of the creativity inventory and the experimental task , it was decided to drop the subject from the study . A total of 43 subjects were left in the analy - sis . Table 2 presents the means and standard deviations for the creativity preinventory and post - inventory scores . Multivariate analysis of variance techniques were used to compare subjects’ inventory scores before and after the experimental manipulation . No signif - icant differences were found between the mean scores at the . 10 probability level . 1 No systematic bias was revealed , and creative ability did not appear influenced by the treatment conditions . Judges’ reliability Interrater reliability was determined for each measure of creativity assessed by the judges Because of the exploratory nature of this investigation , the . 10 probability level , a more inclusive criterion , was delected for hypothesis testing ( Cohen , 1977 ) .

Standard deviations appear in parentheses . The higher the value , the more the individual is predisposed to perform creatively . ( Huck , et al . , 1974 ) . The coefficient of correla - tion for novelty was . 88 and for value , . 74 . The high degree of agreement on novelty is logical with expert - level raters ( Amabile and Tighe , 1993 ) . The more moderate agreement on value is logical given the experts were involved in dif - ferent aspects of the problem domain . Idea fluency Hypothesis testing began by inVestigating H1 , the impact of the experimental treatments on the number of ideas generated by each subject . The means and standard deviations for this measure can be found in Table 2 . In preparing to perform a one - way analysis of variance , preliminary tests showed that the homogeneity of variance assumption was violat - ed ( Bartlett - Box F = 2 . 22 , p < . 10 ) , while fre - quency distributions and normal plots on the number of ideas generated indicated the pres - ence of a bimodal distribution . Specifically , clus - tering existed around the low and high values for idea fluency . Although the creativity inventory results indicat - ed that subjects were dispersed throughout the treatments in an unbiased manner , the invento - ries did not directly account for a subject’s abili - ty to generate ideas . In the psychological litera - ture , idea fluency has been characterized as a creative ability that remains relatively constant 90 MIS Quarterly / March 1996 Creativity Support Systems over time ( Guilford , 1950 ; Torrance , 1988 ; and Wallach , 1983 ) . Consequently , rather than have a random sample free of systematic bias , the treatment groups contained individuals who appeared to vary in their ability to generate ideas . To statistically adjust these conditions so that the hypotheses could be appropriately tested , an additional independent factor entitled Fluency - - with two levels ( high and Iow ) - - was formed ( Dillon and Goldstein , 1984 ) . Subjects were placed into the high - fluency category if they generated more than the mean number of responses ( i . e . , four or more ) and into the low - fluency category if they generated three or fewer responses . Because the subjects were dispersed throughout the treatment condiiions in such a fashion that discernible fluency levels could be formed , the analysis continued . 2 Creative performance A creative performance score was generated by averaging each subject’s total novelty and value rating scores . 3 By using an averaging process , both qualitative and quantitative aspects of a subject’s performance could be simultaneously considered . Because creative ability was only indirectly controlled before the experimental manipulations , hypothesis testing began again using analysis of covariance techniques . 2 Interestingly , creativity research has rarely attempted to directly control for idea fluency before experimental manipu - lation ( Ackoff and Vergara , 1981 ; VanGundy , 1992 ) . Typically , research efforts have not only operationalized idea fluency as a dependent measure of creative perfor - mance , but they have also used bias controls for creative ability that only indirectly consider an individual’s propensity to generate ideas quickly ( Barron and Harrington , 1981 ; Domino , 1970 ; Joseph and Pillaj , 1986 ) . Without establish - ing a subject’s fluency level prior to treatment and control - ling for this potential bias throughout experimentation , any results produced could be due to an individual’s propensity to generate ideas ( either innately present or otherwise learned ) and not the intended experimental manipulation . 3 Total novelty and value rating scores were generated by summing each judge’s ratings on value and novelty for each subject’s response set . These totals were then divided by the number of ideas the given subject generated to dedve a mean novelty and value score for each subject . These mean scores were then averaged across judges to create a total novelty and a total value rating score for each subject . Specifically , an assessment of H1 and H2 was made using the creative performance score as the dependent variable , the treatment condition and degree of fluency present as independent factors , and the creative ability preinventory score as a covariate . Adjusted mean scores for creative performance can be found in Table 3 . The ability covariate was significantly and posi - tively related to creative performance ( F1 , 34 6 . 88 , p < . 01 ) . Two main effects were signifi - cant : treatment ( F3 , ~ 4 = 3 . 9 , p = . 02 ) and fluency ( F1 , ~ 4 = 78 . 75 , p < . 01 ) . No significant interac - tion effects were noted . In addition , fluency accounted for the largest percent of variance explained - - 57 percent - - while treatment accounted for 9 percent , and creative ability accounted for 5 percent . The main effect of fluency revealed that highly fluent subjects generated ideas considered sig - nificantly more creative than those produced by less fluent subjects . And the Scheffe univariate adjusted mean comparisons for interpreting the treatment effect indicated that subjects in the software conditions performed significantly more creatively than subjects in the no software condition ( t = - 3 . 10 , p = . 01 ) . However , no sig - nificant performance differences were noted between the software conditions . H1 was not supported by these findings because the Treatment x Fluency interaction was not significant . Hence , subjects using ICSS software did not generate more ideas than sub - jects using conventional software or no soft - ware . The findings did show partial support for H2 , however , given that subjects using software . outperformed subjects using a pen and paper . Generative and exploratory support Multivariate analysis of covariance techniques were used to examine H3 and H4 , with the nov - elty and value measures as dependent vari - ables , the treatment condition and degree of flu - ency present as independent variables , and the creative ability preinventory score as a covari - ate .

The test for covariation was significant ( Wilks’ lambda = 3 . 26 , p = . 05 ) , with creative ability positively related to both novelty ( F1 , 34 = 3 . 48 , p = . 07 ) and value ( F1 , 34 = 6 . 02 , p = . 02 ) . The overall multivariate test for fluency was signifi - cant ( Wilks’ lambda = 40 . 91 , p < . 01 ) as were the subsequent univariate comparisons for its effect on novelty ( F ~ , 34 = 51 . 38 , p < . 01 ) and value ( F ~ . 34 = 70 . 01 , p < . 01 ) . Thus , highly flu - ent subjects produced ideas that were judged significantly more novel and valuable than those produced by less fluent subjects . The overall multivariate test for treatment was also significant ( Wilks’ lambda = 2 . 54 , p = . 03 ) , with the univadate comparisons for its effect on novelty ( F3 . 34 = 2 . 56 , p = . 07 ) and value ( F3 , 34 4 . 00 , p = . 01 ) significant . In addition , Scheffe mean comparisons . suggested that subjects in all three software conditions produced ideas judged significantly more novel ( t = - 2 . 40 , p = . 02 ) and more valuable ( t = - 2 . 86 , p = . 01 ) than those pro - duced in the no software condition . But , subjects in the software treatments did not significantly outperform each other on novelty or value . No interactions were noted in this analysis . In general , these findings do not support H3 and H4 since the generative application did not outperform the exploratory on the perceived novelty of ideas produced , and the exploratory 92 MIS Quarterly ~ March 1996 Creativity Support Systems application did not outperform the generative on perceived value . Software satisfaction To investigate subjects’ satisfaction concerning the software they used , composite measures of computer comfort , software likability , better decision support , and ease of use were formed by averaging subjects’ responses across relat - ed items . The means and standard deviations of these measures can be found in Table 4 . With no significant covariation , the composite satisfaction measures served as dependent vari - ables , with the treatment condition and degree of fluency present as independent factors in a multivariate analysis of variance . Overall , the main effect of treatment was significant ( Wilks’ lambda = 2 . 15 , p = . 02 ) , indicating subjects’ sat - isfaction varied depending on the software they used . Univariate comparisons revealed signifi - cant differences in perceptions of software lika - bility ( F2 , 31 = 6 . 31 , p < . 01 ) and ease of use ( F2 , 31 = 7 . 36 , p < . 01 ) . Specifically , individual mean comparisons showed that subjects using the generative application liked it significantly / ess than subjects using either the conventional ( t 3 . 44 , p = . 01 ) or exploratory ( t = 4 . 27 , p = 02 ) application . The generative application was also rated significantly more difficult to use than either the conventional ( t = 3 . 36 , p = . 01 ) exploratory ( t = 3 . 27 , p = . 01 ) . Satisfaction with the conventional or exploratory applications did not differ . Moreover , fluency did not affect soft - ware satisfaction , perceptions of computer com - fort or better decision support did not vary between the software conditions , and no interac - tions were noted . Conclusion Although using experimental and statistical tech - niques to control for the decision task , creativity training , and creative ability precluded a compre - hensive examination of Figure 1 , an indication that software support directly enhances an indi - vidual’s creative performance was noted . Moreover , since the number of ideas generated did not differ between treatment conditions , and all subjects in the software conditions had prior experience with computers , it is unlikely that using technology , per se , produced the perfor - mance enhancements . Rather , the finding that satisfaction with the generative software was rel - atively low while performance was high suggests the applications might have been providing deci - sion support and not simply charming subjects into performing more creatively . However , because performance did not differ between the software conditions , this experi - ment cannot explain exactly how the software enhanced creative performance . Both genera - tive and exploratory thought seemed equally well supported , though the software features examined were expected to provide differential support . One potentially valuable use for ICSS technology may be to frame thought in a partic - ular manner so that the ideas produced reflect specific qualities . However , if all support fea - tures improve novelty and value equally well , then discerning which feature to use when becomes arbitrary . Moreover , because low rat - ings on likability and usability did not appear to negatively affect performance , further study of the impact of ICSS design on creative perfor - mance seems appropriate . Another limitation to this investigation is the one - time examination of the technology . While the performance difference noted was favor - able to the technology , the efficacy of an ICSS to enhance creativity over time was not exam - ined . And potential relationships between ICSS technology , creativity training , and the decision task were not fully explored . For example , although the technology appeared to enhance performance when training was held constant , ICSS may directly affect training efforts . Or , a more analytic decision task may hinder the ability of ICSS to enhance creative perfor - mance . Despite its limitations , a few useful insights have been gained from this investigation . First , an empirical demonstration of ICSS technolo - gy’s positive effect on creative performance offers an encouraging confirmation for its popu - larity . Second , a formal consideration of factors relevant for creativity enhancement provides a focus for managerial efforts to improve creative MIS Quarter / y / March 1996 93 Creativity Support Systems Table 4 .

Third , the inclusion of idea fluency as an independent factor affecting creative per - formance suggests a more thorough approach to researching creativity . These insights may not only allow for better designs and applica - tions of , ICSS , but may also ultimately improve the ability of organizations to creatively respond to their environments . 94 MIS Quarterly ~ March 1996 Creativity Support Systems Acknowledgements The author would like to thank Thomas Abraham , Larry W .
