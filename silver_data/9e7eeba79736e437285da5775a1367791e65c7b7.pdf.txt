It is of equal importance to evaluate the risk of transmission in children who are often asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic carriers that may incidentally transmit SARS - CoV - 2 in different settings . We conducted this review to assess transmission and risks for SARS - CoV - 2 in children ( by age - groups or grades ) in community and educational - settings compared to adults . Methods Data for the review were retrieved from PubMed , EMBASE , Cochrane Library , WHO COVID - 19 Database , China National Knowledge Infrastructure ( CNKI ) Database , WanFang Database , Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature ( LILACS ) , Google Schol - ar , and preprints from medRixv and bioRixv ) covering a timeline from December 1 , 2019 to April 1 , 2021 . Population - screening , contact - tracing and cohort studies reporting prevalence and transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 in children were included . Data were extracted according to PRISMA guidelines . Meta - analyses were performed using Review Manager 5 . 3 . Results Ninety studies were included . Compared to adults , children showed comparable national ( risk ratio ( RR ) = 0 . 87 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) = 0 . 71 - 1 . 060 and subnational ( RR = 0 . 81 , 95 % CI = 0 . 66 - 1 . 01 ) prevalence in population - screening studies , and lower odds of infection in community / household contact - tracing studies ( odds ratio ( OR ) = 0 . 62 , 95 % CI = 0 . 46 - 0 . 84 ) . On disaggregation , adolescents observed comparable risk ( OR = 1 . 22 , 95 % CI = 0 . 74 - 2 . 04 ) with adults . In educational - settings , children attending daycare / preschools ( OR = 0 . 53 , 95 % CI = 0 . 38 - 0 . 72 ) were observed to be at lower - risk when compared to adults , with odds of infection among primary ( OR = 0 . 85 , 95 % CI = 0 . 55 - 1 . 31 ) and high - schoolers ( OR = 1 . 30 , 95 % CI = 0 . 71 - 2 . 38 ) comparable to adults . Overall , children and adolescents had lower odds of infection in educational - settings compared to community and household clusters . Conclusions Children ( < 10 years ) showed lower susceptibility to COVID - 19 compared to adults , whereas adolescents in communities and high - schoolers had comparable risk . Risks of infection among children in educational - settings was lower than in communities . Evidence from school - based studies demonstrate it is largely safe for children ( < 10 years ) to be at schools , however older children ( 10 - 19 years ) might facilitate transmission . Despite this evidence , stud - ies focusing on the effectiveness of mitigation measures in educational settings are urgently needed to support both public health and educational policy - making for school reopening .

Risk of infection and transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 among children and adolescents in households , communities and educa - tional settings : A systematic review and meta - analysis . J Glob Health 2021 ; 11 : 05013 . As of 5 April 2021 , there have been 131 . 0 million confirmed COVID - 19 cases and nearly 2 . 8 mil - lion confirmed deaths globally [ 1 ] . The response in countries worldwide has gone from an initial stage of strict lockdowns and business closures to variable periods of relaxation with social distanc - ing , use of face masks and hand hygiene , and now vaccination roll outs for adults . During this pe - riod , daycare centers , schools and educational institutions were closed initially and then reopened Irfan et al .

This has however , been a bone of much contention across the world with various countries adopting different measures . The global spread of variants of concern now threatens to reverse progress and disrupt the opening of the economy , commerce and education . School closures are understandable . Children play an important role in the transmission of some respiratory infectious diseases and may suffer from more severe outcomes than adults , such as influenza [ 2 , 3 ] , rendering school closures an effective public health policy in reducing the spread and influence of these diseases . This is especially true in novel pandemics where pharmaceutical interventions , such as vaccines , are not immediate - ly available and delaying disease spread is a priority [ 3 - 6 ] . However , children and adolescents under 19 years of age comprise a small proportion of total reported COVID - 19 cases ( 1 % - 10 % ) [ 7 - 9 ] . This group has been reported to present with a milder clinical course compared to adults infected with SARS - CoV - 2 , with more fa - vorable outcomes in general [ 7 , 9 - 11 ] . To date , there is much controversy concerning the benefits of the ongoing and future closure of schools and other educational institutions in controlling the COVID - 19 pandemic , as limited data on transmission of COVID - 19 in educational settings is available [ 12 - 16 ] . It is of equal importance to evaluate the risk of suscep - tibility and transmission in children who are often asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic carriers , that may in - cidentally transmit SARS - CoV - 2 in both educational and community settings , especially with the third wave of COVID - 19 and newer variants spreading in many Countries crippling the health care system and economy . We undertook a systematic review of the infection and transmission rates and risks of SARS - CoV - 2 in children and adolescents in household , community and educational settings since the beginning of the pandemic , to help in understanding policy responses for safe school reopening for children of various ages . METHODS This systematic review is reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta - Analyses ( PRISMA ) reporting guidelines . In this review , we focused on the following review objectives : 1 - What is the overall risk of infection in children and adolescents compared to adults ( > 19 years ) from pop - ulation screening and contact - tracing studies ? 2 - What are the odds of being an infected contact in children and adolescents compared to adults ( > 19 years ) in educational settings ? 3 - What is the risk of infection for children and adolescents in educational settings in comparison to that in communities ? Literature search To investigate the risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection and transmission in children and adolescents and their potential contribution to transmission in various settings , we searched for national and subnational prevalence studies , and contact - tracing studies ( CTS ) from community / household clusters and educational settings . Data for the review were retrieved from PubMed , EMBASE , Cochrane Library , WHO COVID - 19 Database , China National Knowledge Infrastructure ( CNKI ) Database , WanFang Database , Latin American and Carib - bean Health Sciences Literature ( LILACS ) , Google Scholar , and “Living Evidence of COVID - 19” ( a database updated daily with published articles from PubMed and EMBASE and preprints from medRixv and bioRixv ) covering a timeline from December 1 , 2019 to April 1 , 2021 . Preprints from ChinaXiv ( http : / / www . chinaxiv . org / home . htm ) were also searched . Complementary searches were conducted by manually searching the na - tional public health websites , and the John Hopkins Humanitarian Health Resource . The reference lists of all retrieved articles were examined as well . There was no language restriction applied for the search . The search terms applied for each research question and the specific search strategies for PubMed and other databases are provided in Table S1 in the Online Supplementary Document . The search results from various databases were uploaded into Covidence Systematic Review Software ( Veritas Health Innovation 2016 , Melbourne , Australia ) for screening . Inclusion and exclusion criteria We included population screening studies investigating the age - specific prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 infections , contact - tracing and cohort studies reporting the incidence and attack rate ( number of infections secondary to a suspected close contact ) of children ( 0 - 9 years ) and adolescents ( 10 - 19 years old ) compared to adults , case COVID among children and adolescents V I E W P O I N TS R E S E A R C H T H E M E 1 : C O V I D - 19 P A N D E M I C www . jogh . org • doi : 10 . 7189 / jogh . 11 . 05013 3 2021 • Vol . 11 • 05013 series presenting direct evidence of COVID - 19 cases transmitted by SARS - CoV - 2 positive children compared to adults , and data from national public health websites and official government reports , when available . We excluded review articles , opinions , viewpoints and communication letters ( if not presenting data on number of infections or attack rate of SARS - CoV - 2 ) and modeling studies were also excluded . Studies that did not re - port the number of infections or attack rate of SARS - CoV - 2 , and studies with possible duplications of cases ( eg , overlapping time periods within the same institutions / cities / countries ) were also excluded . Study screening Two review authors independently reviewed each title and abstract from the search results . Upon obtaining the full text , two reviewers independently screened the full text and decided whether to include or exclude the study , in accordance with the criteria specified previously . Any disagreements were resolved by indepen - dent review by a third author . Data extraction The following data were extracted from each study using standardized data abstraction forms : authors , country , study type , study period and its relationship with the epidemic curve in the country / area and school closure / reopen status , study setting ( household , community , daycare , primary or secondary school ; other mitigation measures if any ) , case definition ( index case , primary case , secondary case ) , testing methods , contact - tracing methods , sampling method , number of infected children and / or adults ( specified whether or not student - con - tacting staff ) and total number of students and staff in the educational setting ( or reported attack rate ) . Meta - analysis and qualitative synthesis For each dichotomous outcome , the weighted mean prevalence and 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) was cal - culated . The meta - analyses were performed using Review Manager 5 . 3 adopting the random - effects models . Pooled risk ratios ( RR ) between children and adults were presented in both national and subnational prevalence studies with disaggregation into active infection and past infection indicated by PCR testing and antibodies seroprevalence , respectively . The pooled odds ratios ( OR ) of children being infected in households were pre - sented and disaggregated by children ( < 10 years ) and adolescent ( 10 - 19 years ) , and school operational status ( open / partially open or closed ) in the region / Country . The odds of contracting infection in children compared to adults in schools and daycare centers were also analyzed . Total number of children and adolescents tested and diagnosed with COVID - 19 were computed separately for communities and educational settings to calcu - late the odds ratio ( OR ) of risk of infection in educational settings compared to community settings . Statistical heterogeneity across studies was evaluated by calculating the I 2 statistic . I 2 values equal to or above 50 % were considered as “significant” heterogeneity in this study . Additionally , the χ 2 test for heterogeneity was performed and the forest plot was visually inspected to assess the degree of overlap between the CIs of included studies . The characteristics , biases , and results of the included studies were summarized narratively . For studies in - cluded but not eligible for meta - analysis due to a lack of sufficient data , we also qualitatively synthesized the results to present a full picture . Assessment of methodological quality and risk of bias Two independent reviewers assessed each included study for methodological quality . A quality assessment tool was adopted from the National Heart , Lung , and Brain Institute ( NHLBI ) and Research Triangle Institute Inter - national [ 17 ] for observational studies , where are as the quality of prevalence studies was assessed using a crit - ical appraisal checklist for prevalence studies [ 18 ] . Study quality was scored on basis of clear study objectives , case definition , consecutive inclusion of cases , sample sizes , comparability of included patients , measurement of outcomes , length of follow - up , and appropriately defined statistical methods and results . However , stud - ies were not excluded based on study quality . Studies with score 6 - 8 were considered to be good quality , 4 - 5 considered fair quality and < 4 considered poor quality . RESULTS The systemic literature search yielded 3700 results during the search dates . Of these , 117 studies were examined in full text and 90 were included in the final analysis after addition of 3 studies from other resources ( Figure 1 ) . The characteristics of included studies were summarized in Table S2 in the Online Supplementary Doc - ument .

The overall risk of SARS - Cov - 2 infection among children and adolescents in comparison to adults To investigate the overall risk of SARS - Cov - 2 infec - tion among children and adolescents , we included 60 studies , of which 29 were population - screening studies [ 19 - 47 ] and 31 were CTS [ 48 - 78 ] . The prevalence of COVID - 19 in children and ad - olescents ( < 20 years of age ) were reported in 11 national and 18 subnational surveillance studies . Among them , six were from low - and middle - in - come countries ( LMICs ) . Compared to adult pop - ulations , a comparable risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infec - tion was observed in children and adolescents in both national ( RR = 0 . 87 , 95 % CI = 0 . 71 - 1 . 06 ) and subnational ( RR = 0 . 81 , 95 % CI = 0 . 66 - 1 . 01 ) sur - veillance studies , as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3 . When disaggregated by testing methods ( ie , RT - PCR vs serological test ) , children and adolescents showed a similar lower risk of past infection from seroprevalence data in national ( RR = 0 . 77 , 95 % CI = 0 . 62 - 0 . 96 ) studies but insignificant effect in subnational studies ( RR = 0 . 80 , 95 % CI = 0 . 59 - 1 . 08 ) . The risk of active infection was lower compared to adults but insignificant in both national studies ( RR = 0 . 98 , 95 % CI = 0 . 69 - 1 . 38 ) and subnational surveillance studies at point estimate level ( RR = 0 . 77 , 95 % CI = 0 . 48 - 1 . 22 ) .

Thirty - one studies undertook contact - tracing in community , household and family clusters , of which , 12 were from LMICs . The pooled odds of secondary attack in children and adolescents was significantly lower than that in adults ( OR = 0 . 62 , 95 % CI = 0 . 46 - 0 . 84 ) , with high heterogeneity ( I 2 = 0 . 91 ) ( Figure 4 , Panel A ) . When further disaggregated by the schools’ operational status ( ie , school closure vs school fully or partially open ) during the study period , both children and adolescents were found to have lower risk of infection than did adults when COVID among children and adolescents V I E W P O I N TS R E S E A R C H T H E M E 1 : C O V I D - 19 P A N D E M I C www . jogh . org • doi : 10 . 7189 / jogh . 11 . 05013 5 2021 • Vol . 11 • 05013 schools were fully or partially open ( OR = 0 . 52 , 95 % CI = 0 . 33 - 0 . 83 ) , but no significant effect during school closures ( OR = 0 . 72 , 95 % CI = 0 . 46 - 1 . 14 ) . In a subgroup analysis of CTS ( based on 18 out of the 31 studies ) in which age - disaggregation was possible , we found that the pooled OR for SARS - CoV - 2 infection among children compared to adults was 0 . 57 ( 95 % CI = 0 . 37 - 0 . 87 ) , suggesting a significantly lower risk of secondary attack in this population at the communi - ty and household level . However , a comparable risk of secondary attack was observed among adolescents ( OR = 1 . 22 , 95 % CI = 0 . 74 - 2 . 04 ) ( Figure 4 , Panel B ) . Infection and transmission of COVID - 19 among children and adolescents in educational settings compared to adult teachers and staff Thirty studies conducted in educational settings were included [ 12 - 15 , 57 , 79 - 103 ] , among which six studies were cross - sectional studies and the remaining 24 were contact - tracing or cohort studies . Upon checking the availability of sufficient data for comparison of children vs adults , 24 studies were included in the meta - analysis . The pooled estimate of the included studies suggested that children and adolescents appeared to have a lower though statistically insignificant risk of secondary attack in school settings when compared to adults ( OR = 0 . 84 , 95 % CI = 0 . 62 - 1 . 14 ) ( Figure 5 ) . Subgroup analysis also suggested significant lower odds of infection among children attending daycare centers / preschools ( OR = 0 . 53 , 95 % CI = 0 . 38 - 0 . 72 ) , but insignificant effect in pri - mary schools ( OR = 0 . 85 , 95 % CI = 0 . 55 - 1 . 31 ) compared to the adult staff . However , high - school students had comparable risk of infection to adults ( OR = 1 . 30 , 95 % CI = 0 . 71 - 2 . 38 ) . Risk of contracting SARS - CoV - 2 infection among children and adolescents in schools compared to community settings Using the existing evidence from both community - based studies and studies conducted in educational set - tings , we further calculated the pooled odds ratios for contracting infection among children and adolescent in educational settings vs communities and household - clusters . When total number of children and adolescents tested and diagnosed with COVID - 19 in the two settings were compared , children observed lower odds of Figure 3 .

Out of the 29 population prevalence studies , 28 were of good quality while one was of fair quality . Twenty - five out of 31 contact - tracing studies were of good quality while six were of fair quality . For studies conducted in educational settings , eight were of fair quality and the remaining 22 were of good quality . Studies were primarily downgraded for inadequate sample size and unclear description of study setting . How - ever , potential biases were noted for some of the included studies , which could negatively affect their quality ( eg , low response rate from the study population in contact - tracing studies [ 15 , 81 , 83 , 85 ] , only symptomatic cases receiving tests [ 12 , 14 , 79 , 86 , 104 ] ) . DISCUSSION This systematic review provides a comprehensive assessment of COVID - 19 risk of infection and transmission in children and adolescents compared to adults in household , community and educational settings and in the relationship of age and school contexts with risks of transmission . Consistent with previous reviews [ 105 , 106 ] , we found an overall lower risk of infection among children and adolescents ( 0 - 19 years ) in households and communities compared to adults . In educational settings , children attending daycare , preschool and primary school presented a lower risk of infection than that of adults . Our review has several important strengths . Compared to existing reviews [ 105 , 106 ] , most of which were conducted at an earlier stage of the pandemic , the present review provided the most up - to - date evidence of this research question . We have undertaken several pre - specified sub - group analyses as per data avail - ability . The subgroup comparisons included assessment of active infection ( PCR test ) , past infection ( blood serology ) , school operational status and differential effects by age groups . It was also important to assess if the risk of community transmission was affected by school closure . Using a broad search strategy imple - mented in English , Chinese and Spanish databases , we summarize evidence from 90 studies from 31 dif - ferent countries . We also attempted to reduce possible overlap in cases to prevent duplication . Compared to a previous systematic review by Viner et al [ 105 ] , we report almost thrice the number of studies with disaggregation of analyses by age and settings . This review is primarily limited by the large heterogeneity across studies and the lack of uniform age - and test - specific evidence for transmission in different study set - tings . Lastly , the evidence of COVID - 19 infection in children is rapidly evolving ; therefore , evidence from this review should be cautiously interpreted and regularly updated . This review does not include model - ling studies , which can forecast future transmission scenarios but under various assumptions about disease transmission and immunity [ 107 ] . Currently available epidemiological data have revealed two unique features of pediatric COVID - 19 cases : a relatively low prevalence in this population and milder clinical features compared to adult patients [ 9 , 108 ] . Several studies and reviews have studied children and adolescents’ susceptibility to SARS - CoV - 2 infection and their role in transmission in different settings . Viner et al . examined studies on the prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in children and young people ( < 20 years ) , and found that the pooled odds ratio of being infected among children vs adults was 0 . 56 ( 95 % CI : 0 . 37 - 0 . 85 ) with substantial heterogeneity ( I 2 = 95 % ) [ 105 ] . Goldstein et al [ 109 ] reviewed data on detection of SARS - CoV - 2 infection in different settings and suggested a significantly lower susceptibility of infection for children ( < 10 years of age ) compared to adults . There was some evidence of robust spread of SARS - CoV - 2 in secondary and high - schools ( eg , high sero - prevalence of anti - SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies among high - school students in northern France [ 83 ] , and an outbreak in an Israel high - school [ 13 ] ) , while the spread seemed to be more limited in primary schools [ 12 , 14 , 15 , 82 , 88 - 91 ] . Xu et al . conducted a living systematic review and reported that the SARS - CoV - 2 in - fection attack rates were 0 . 15 % ( 95 % CI = 0 % - 0 . 93 % ) among students and 0 . 70 % ( 95 % CI = 0 % - 3 . 56 % ) among school staff , respectively [ 110 ] . These findings are largely consistent with the primary finding of the present study that children are not as susceptible to SARS - CoV - 2 infection as adults , and while children are known to be “super spreaders” for influenza [ 111 ] and measles viruses [ 112 ] , they play only a limited role in SARS - CoV - 2 transmission in various settings . Symptomatic patients have a lower SARS - CoV - 2 cycle threshold ( Ct ) values , which corresponds to higher viral RNA levels . SARS - CoV - 2 Ct values have been found to be almost linearly inversely correlated with its trans - mission [ 113 ] . Furthermore , a meta - analysis reported risk of asymptomatic transmission is significantly lower COVID among children and adolescents V I E W P O I N TS R E S E A R C H T H E M E 1 : C O V I D - 19 P A N D E M I C www . jogh . org • doi : 10 . 7189 / jogh . 11 . 05013 9 2021 • Vol . 11 • 05013 than that of symptomatic transmission ( relative risk = 0 . 58 ; 95 % CI = 0 . 34 - 0 . 99 ) [ 114 ] . To contextualize , these findings might suggest that children may be less likely to transmit SARS - CoV - 2 due to their lower prevalence of symptomatic and severe presentation during the infection [ 115 ] . School closures are an effective public health mitigation measure in reducing the community transmission of many respiratory infectious diseases , such as influenza [ 2 , 3 ] , however , current evidence on the effectiveness of school closures in curbing the COVID - 19 pandemic is inconsistent . Large experiences from Australia , USA and England demonstrated low transmission rates in schools and early childhood education services when these facilities were still open [ 90 , 91 , 116 ] . However , Auger et al . conducted a US population - based observa - tional study between March 9 and May 7 , 2020 and found that school closure was associated with a significant decline in the incidence of COVID - 19 [ 117 ] . Majority of the school linked index cases report none or only a small number of secondary cases [ 91 , 93 ] . Reports investigating outbreaks have demonstrated a higher trans - mission by school - age children to other students or teachers , particularly when the mitigation measures were inadequately implemented in schools [ 104 ] . Reports from Sweden [ 118 ] and US [ 119 ] suggest a comparable increased risk of transmission from teacher to students and other staff members . These highlight the significance of focusing COVID - 19 prevention protocols and vaccination strategies for the teachers , which may indirectly protect students who might not be immediately prioritized in the vaccine rollout . In the present study , we find overall that opening educational establishments may not predispose children and adolescents to a higher risk of SARS - CoV - 2 infection compared to adults . On the contrary , children and adolescents were found to have more than 2 - fold greater risk of infection in household and community settings than in schools . The school attendance may serve as a protective factor , which reduces children’s chances of community contacts in a rel - atively isolated environment during school hours . It may also be attributable to the effective infections control measures applied in schools introduced by global and national guidelines . Importantly , prolonged school closures have also been found to have negative impacts on the education - al and social development of children including increasing mental disorders , worsening nutrition , lack of physical activities , substance abuse , child violence and abuse [ 106 , 120 - 124 ] . Lessons from the 2013 - 2016 Ebola pandemic suggested that youth , and young girls in particular , of poor households saw the largest increase in permanent school dropouts post - Ebola [ 125 , 126 ] . The disruption of education is particularly harmful to young children who are in the most sensitive window of learning , as the early education loss could permanently affect the development of one’s foundational skills [ 127 ] . Alternative educational op - portunities such as online distance learning may not be available to poorer or marginalized populations and are non - existent in many LMICs [ 128 ] . The decision to reopen schools is understandably a delicate balance between various factors , including the incidence of COVID - 19 cases in the community , the concerns and choices of the parents and the public , the school - based mitigation strategies in place including vaccinations for teachers and the availability of resources . It is recommended that schools should only be reopened when the prevalence of COVID - 19 at the community level is under a relatively safe threshold [ 129 ] . Safe reopening of schools is not possible without proper mitigation plans and strategies in place . Some of the measures , which are suggested by the present guidelines , include repeat testing , avoiding crowded / close con - tact environments , social distancing , wearing facial coverings , maintaining hand hygiene , and some protec - tive measure of classrooms and environment , including limiting classroom size and ensuring adequate ven - tilation including open air classes where feasible [ 130 ] . Despite these recommended actions , there are major challenges in evaluating the effectiveness of such guidelines . It is even more challenging to ensure the most ef - fective interventions to be properly implemented in schools . Mitigation strategies at schools may incur a con - siderable financial cost . For instance , it was estimated that an additional 20 billion USD would be needed for the nationwide implementation of recommended school - based mitigation strategies in the US [ 131 ] . There is currently limited data on and much need for collating evidence from safe school reopening strategies and ex - perience across the world . Given the highly contagious nature of SARS - CoV - 2 and the new variants , a expanding vaccine eligibility for children and adolescents and addressing it’s hesitancy is the most effective strategy for returning children to schools [ 116 ] . While some countries have prioritized vaccination of school teachers and staff to reduce oc - cupational transmission , the evidence of effectiveness of vaccination strategies in adolescents is just emerging [ 132 ] and trials are being ramped up in younger children [ 133 ] . Given the potential serious complications of COVID - 19 infection in subsets of children [ 134 ] , vaccination research and implementation in children must be prioritized across the world .
