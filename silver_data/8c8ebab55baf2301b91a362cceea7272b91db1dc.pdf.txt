The molecular function of plastin - 3 is not fully understood . Since PLS3 is located on the X chromosome , males are usually more severely affected than females . PLS3 mutations have thus far been reported in approximately 20 young patients with low bone mineral density ( BMD ) . We describe an 8 - year - old Greek boy with severe primary osteoporosis with multiple vertebral compression fractures and one low - energy long bone fracture . His clinical manifestations were consistent with osteogenesis imperfecta , including blue sclerae , joint hypermobility , low bone mineral density , kyphosis , bilateral conductive hearing loss , and mild dysmorphic features . The family history was negative for primary osteoporosis . COL1A1 and COL1A2 mutations were excluded by Sanger sequencing . However , Sanger sequencing of PLS3 led to the identi ﬁ cation of a de novo frameshift deletion , NM _ 005032 : c . 1096 _ 1100delAACTT , p . ( Asn366Serfs * 5 ) , in exon 10 con ﬁ rming the diagnosis of PLS3 osteoporosis . In conclusion , we describe a novel frameshift deletion in PLS3 causing severe primary osteoporosis in a boy . Our ﬁ nding highlights the clinical overlap between type I collagen and PLS3 - related skeletal fragility and underscores the importance of PLS3 screening in patients with multiple fractures to enable proper genetic counseling . Introduction Primary osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mineral density ( BMD ) and recurrent low - energy peripheral and vertebral fractures . Primary osteoporosis is often classi ﬁ ed as osteogenesis imperfecta ( OI ) . Although brittle bones are the main hallmark , extraskeletal manifestations including blue sclerae , dentinogenesis imperfecta and hearing loss are also common in OI . The genetic and phenotypic variability is great and mutations in around 20 genes have been dis - covered to cause mild to progressively deforming OI so far . An X - linked form of primary osteoporosis with no extra - skeletal manifestations has recently been assigned to mutations in PLS3 , encoding plastin - 3 [ 1 – 3 ] . To date , less than 20 point mutations and small to large deletions have been identi ﬁ ed in PLS3 in patients with early - onset primary osteoporosis but the full clinical and genetic spectrum remains inadequately described [ 1 , 4 – 8 ] . Due to the X - chromosomal location of PLS3 , males are usually more severely affected than females . The cellular functions of plastin - 3 are not well known . Plastin - 3 , which contains 2 calcium - binding EF - hand motifs and 2 actin - binding domains , is an actin - binding and bundling protein that is important for the neuromuscular junction and acts as a protective modi ﬁ er in spinal muscular atrophy ( SMA ) [ 9 – 11 ] . Furthermore , plastin - 3 also plays a role in bone mineralization [ 2 , 4 , 5 , 7 ] , but the pathogenic mechanisms * Alice Costantini alice . costantini @ ki . se 1 Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery and Center for Molecular Medicine , Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm , Sweden 2 Department of Orthopaedics , “ Aghia Sophia ” Children ’ s Hospital , Athens , Greece 3 Neonatal Special Care Unit General Hospital of Chania , Crete , Greece 4 Folkhälsan Institute of Genetics and University of Helsinki , Helsinki , Finland 5 Children ’ s Hospital , University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital , Helsinki , Finland 6 Department of Clinical Genetics , Karolinska University Hospital , Stockholm , Sweden 7 Department of Bone and Mineral Metabolism , Institute of Child Health , “ Aghia Sophia ” Children ’ s Hospital , Athens , Greece 1234567890 ( ) ; , : 1234567890 ( ) ; , : underlying PLS3 osteoporosis are not completely understood . Here we describe a novel de novo frameshift deletion in PLS3 in a Greek boy who presented with signi ﬁ cant skeletal fragility but also with similar extra - skeletal manifestations to OI patients with COL1A1 and COL1A2 mutations . Materials and methods We recruited a Greek 8 - year - old boy with primary osteo - porosis . Before inclusion in our study , a written informed consent was signed by his parents . Blood sample collection from the proband and his parents as well as genetic inves - tigations were performed according to our ethically approved protocol . Genomic DNA extraction and Sanger sequencing were performed according to standard proce - dures . Clinical data were collected retrospectively from hospital records . Case report In this study we report on an 8 - year - old boy with primary osteoporosis . He had sustained a low - energy fracture of his left femur at the age of 2 . 5 years , after a fall from standing height . Kyphosis was noted clinically soon thereafter ; subsequently , a lateral spine X - ray revealed fractures of thoracic vertebrae ( T5 , T6 , and T8 ) , con ﬁ rmed with spine MRI ( Fig . 1a – c ) . A full diagnostic work up for osteoporosis etiology was normal . Inborn errors of metabolism , hema - tological and endocrine disorders were excluded . Abdom - inal ultrasound , audiogram and cardiac assessments were all normal . Antenatal and perinatal histories were unremarkable . He had surgery for pyloric stenosis and right - sided cryptorchid - ism in his infancy . There were no dental issues . His calcium intake was adequate and his physical activity was normal . His parents were non - consanguineous and there was no family history for early - onset osteoporosis . Of note , his father had been operated for aortic aneurysm and his maternal aunt had a history of developmental dysplasia of the hips . Further investigations were carried out at the age of 6 years . On examination , he had normal growth ( height 25th centile , weight 50th centile ) , blue sclerae , joint hypermo - bility , and kyphosis . Also seen were subtle , but distinct , dysmorphic features featuring prominent epicanthic folds , narrow external ear canals , mild micrognathia , and a high - arched palate ( Fig . 1 ) . His laboratory parameters for calcium homeostasis and metabolic bone markers showed mild hypercalciuria and slightly increased uDPD / uCreat ( 47 nmol / mmol ; reference range = 10 – 35 nmol / mmol ) . On DXA scan ( GE Lunar Prodigy encore , Pediatric software ) he had low lumbar spine ( LS ) BMD ( L2 – L4 Z - score − 3 . 5 ) and low total body less head ( TBLH ) bone mineral content ( Z - score − 2 . 2 ) , but normal height - adjusted lean body mass for age , compatible with a primary bone disorder .

A clinical diagnosis of OI was suspected and sequencing of COL1A1 and COL1A2 was undertaken . No mutation was found . He was started on oral alendronate , at 35 mg / week and 400 IU / d cholecalciferol ; IV zoledronic acid was con - sidered but could not be initiated because of a long distance to the hospital . Since the phenotype of our patient resembled that of children with PLS3 osteoporosis , we proceeded by PLS3 sequencing . A novel frameshift deletion , NM _ 005032 : c . 1096 _ 1100delAACTT , in exon 10 was subsequently identi ﬁ ed ( Fig . 2 ) . The mutation leads to frameshift in the coding sequence and early termination of amino acid sequence p . ( Asn366Serfs * 5 ) ( Fig . 3 ) . It was absent in the mother and thus determined as a de novo change ( Fig . 2 ) . This variant is classi ﬁ ed as pathogenic according to the ACMG guidelines [ 12 ] . After one year of alendronate treatment , he was reviewed at age 7 . 5 years . His growth was normal ( height 25th cen - tile , weight 50th – 75th centile ) and no new fractures occurred , bone markers were appropriately suppressed and BMD was improved : LS BMD Z - score − 2 . 3 and TBLH Z - score − 0 . 8 . Kyphosis improved both clinically and radi - ologically ( Fig . 1 ) . A signi ﬁ cant concern presently is his bilateral conductive hearing loss and very narrow ear canals . Discussion Here we describe a young boy with early - onset primary osteoporosis caused by a novel hemizygous PLS3 deletion c . 1096 _ 1100delAACTT , leading to a frameshift and an early stop codon in the mRNA ( p . Asn366Serfs * 5 ) . The aberrant transcript is likely to be degraded by nonsense - mediated mRNA decay . Since the patient is male and lacks a normal PLS3 allele , plastin - 3 would be completely absent and this would explain his severe phenotype . Alternatively , the deletion may lead to a truncated and most likely non - functional protein . Unfortunately , no additional patient samples were available for further studies of the mutation . Our ﬁ nding expands the genetic spectrum of PLS3 osteo - porosis ( Fig . 3 ) . Interestingly , our patient presented with skeletal and extra - skeletal features that are typical for COL1A1 and COL1A2 related OI , including low BMD , recurrent frac - tures , blue sclerae as well as hearing loss . Blue sclerae and hearing loss are not common features in PLS3 osteoporosis [ 1 , 4 – 7 , 13 – 15 ] . Although OI - related hearing loss usually appears in adulthood due to otosclerosis [ 16 ] , hearing de ﬁ cit in our patient is likely due to his abnormal ear anatomy . Furthermore , our patient also presents with dysmorphic facial features , which have been reported in PLS3 osteo - porosis once before [ 5 ] , suggesting that this may be a part of the disease spectrum . These ﬁ ndings support previous speculations that PLS3 is widely expressed in many tissues Fig . 2 Pedigree of the family and Sanger electropherograms showing the de novo frameshift PLS3 deletion , c . 1096 _ 1100delAACTT , in the index patient . The deleted DNA sequence is labeled with orange color . His mother has instead a wild type sequence Fig . 3 Schematic representation of both the PLS3 gene and protein showing all the mutations causing osteoporosis that have been iden - ti ﬁ ed so far . The mutation here reported is marked in red color A novel frameshift deletion in PLS3 causing severe primary osteoporosis 925 and its total depletion would therefore not affect only bone [ 1 , 4 , 6 , 13 ] . Similar to other patients with PLS3 mutations [ 1 , 6 , 13 ] , bisphosphonate treatment in our patient has increased BMD , improved spinal changes and prevented new fractures . In summary , this is a case of PLS3 primary osteoporosis , which comprises some OI features , comorbidities and dys - morphic features not previously described in this context . Lateral thinking in atypical cases like this is required to detect rarities like PLS3 osteoporosis and to enable appro - priate genetic counseling . Detailed , regular follow - up is imperative , in an effort to record special features of this particular group of patients .
