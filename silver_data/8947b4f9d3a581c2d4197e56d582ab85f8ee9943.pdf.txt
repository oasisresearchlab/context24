We studied what users experience as clutter , what behaviors and factors contribute to the clutter , and what users do when they experience clutter through an interview study ( ùëÅ = 16 ) and an online survey study ( ùëÅ = 400 ) . Based on our studies , browsing clutter includes the amount of tabs and windows , content of the web pages and interactive elements , navigation , and search process . We identified sources of browsing clutter from task characteristics , such as importance and complexity , to user habits , such as multitasking and tab closing . To reveal the dynamics of browsing clutter , we modeled how browsing clutter is predicted by specific browsing habits and coping strategies . Our model demon - strates how individual forms of clutter are interrelated and altered by behavior . We discuss how browsing clutter relates to information overload .

Cluttered experiences that users have while browsing online have been studied from many perspectives . Commonly , these expe - riences are studied as information overload ( e . g . , [ 29 ] ) or technology overload ( e . g . , [ 38 ] ) . In the context of browsing , one proposed as - pect is tab overload . A survey by Kulkarni et al . [ 42 ] discovered that half of their participants perceived tab overload as a problem . An - other recent study uncovered pressures that drive users to keep and close tabs [ 15 ] . Towards addressing the issue of tab overload , past academic and commercial efforts describe and suggest various solu - tions , such as third - party browser extensions [ 11 , 16 , 42 , 53 , 69 , 73 ] and built - in browser features [ 36 ] . Other suggested approaches include changing one‚Äôs attitude , for instance , by practicing self - acceptance for accumulating tabs [ 9 , 81 ] . Another proposed aspect of cluttered browsing experience is web clutter , which refers to unwanted or distracting web content , such as advertisements [ 33 ] and information waste [ 2 ] . In addition to traditional browsing , web browsers are increasingly used as interfaces for other software , such as email or social networking services ( SNS ) , which have also been studied as source of overload for users ( e . g . , [ 23 , 44 , 62 ] ) . However , examining the phenomenon beyond clutter caused by tabs and web content is needed to extensively understand users‚Äô experiences . It is still unclear how different forms of clutter during browsing are experienced by users , although plenty of research has been dedicated to studying the overloaded experiences of users brows - ing and plethora of concepts have been proposed to designate the phenomena . Moreover , as web browsing is interactive , cluttered experiences are likely to influence users‚Äô behavior . This paper deepens the understanding on the cluttered browsing experience by addressing the following research questions : RQ1 What do participants experience as clutter during web brows - ing ? Q2 What behaviors , preferences and factors influence the partic - ipants‚Äô experiences of clutter ? Q3 What do the participants do when they experience something as clutter ? We define browsing clutter as a group of associated experiences of clutter that users have while using browsers . The experiences of clutter are characterized by users feeling overwhelmed and stressed due to the accumulation and disorganization of browser elements and information . These experiences are associated as instances of information overload . However , as discussed later , there are CHI ‚Äô23 , April 23 ‚Äì 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Ma , et al . differences in how information overload is experienced in different settings ( e . g . , having too many tabs , or seeing too many ads ) . In our study , we examine the interactions of those experiences and how they interact with user behavior and coping strategies to better understand the overall phenomenon of information overload during browser usage . With this conceptualization , this study aims to help users and researchers to understand the complex phenomenon present in experiences of clutter during online browsing . By conducting 16 semi - structured interviews and an online sur - vey of 400 participants , we explored users‚Äô perceptions of browsing clutter to discover its forms and sources , including how users cope with it . Our results show that browsing clutter consists of several forms : the amount of tabs and windows , web content and interac - tive elements , navigation , and the search process . We found that browsing clutter is closely related to user habits and task contexts . Browsing habits , such as multitasking or cautious tab closing , and task characteristics , such as complexity and importance , account for browsing clutter . Meanwhile , users have adapted to challenges faced with browsing clutter by adjusting their behavior and atti - tudes . For example , by creating external constraints and adopting avoiding attitudes , users attempt to cope with browsing clutter . The benefits of our approach are the following . First , we start from a broad context of how people use browsers in general , without prescribing the browsing experience as a problem . We discuss all the challenges users perceived as clutter during browser use and conceptualize clutter based on their experience . Second , we include participants with varying views on the browsing experience . Third , we model the dynamics behind the phenomenon . By focusing on different forms of clutter that users experience , we can highlight the commonalities and differences of behaviors that contribute to and how users cope with the different forms of clutter . We studied the dynamics and sources of browsing clutter , aiming to find approaches to reduce the cluttered experiences of users . As modern browsing environments and tasks are complex , so are the users‚Äô cluttered experiences . By understanding the interactions between different forms of cluttered experiences and browsing behaviors , we can identify the root of the problem and be able to design effective solutions to reduce browsing clutter . The major contributions of the paper are as follows . ‚Ä¢ We propose a typology for experiences of clutter , which we call browsing clutter , by exploring what users perceive as a cluttered browsing experience . ‚Ä¢ We explore users‚Äô browsing habits and identify three poten - tialsourcesforbrowsingclutter : browsingtasks , multitasking - related browsing behavior , and tab accumulating habits . ‚Ä¢ We explore how users cope with browsing clutter and cate - gorize their strategies into two types : emotion - focused and problem - focused . ‚Ä¢ Further , we provide quantitative measures of browsing clut - ter and model how certain browsing habits and coping strate - gies affect the browsing clutter . 2 BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK How users browse the internet has been researched since the mid - 1990s . Browsing habits and web browsers have considerably changed since then . In 1995 , browsing was often completed in a single session that lasted for 25 . 5 minutes [ 14 ] , while in 2005 it was 5 . 3 sessions per day with a 30 - minute cut - off [ 31 ] . In 2021 , the average time spent on the internet reached approximately 7 hours per day [ 40 ] . Along with more time spent on the internet , user needs , tasks , and devices of browsing have changed , which have had an impact on the users‚Äô experiences online . Web browsers are used as a platform for many services in addition to information retrieval and search . People use browsers on multiple devices , from laptops to mobile phones . The internet has become more interactive , ubiquitous , and social than it was in the 1990s . Challenges have also emerged . Research on information overload and cluttered experiences of users‚Äô digital technology use have also revealed how the developed technologies have had negative effects on users‚Äô lives . To understand cluttered browsing experiences of users and how browsing has changed , the following sections review research on what users do online , their browsing habits , and information overload associated with browsing experience . What users do online . The browsing task is an essential factor in understanding both users‚Äô intentions and actions for achieving their goals . Many studies have focused on characterizing browsing tasks related to information retrieval ( e . g . , [ 12 , 19 , 50 ] ) . However , as browsers are used for diverse types of activities , browser usage is no longer limited to information retrieval . Apart from searching for information , collaborating [ 49 ] and digital information man - agement [ 10 , 35 ] have become essential use cases for browsers . This section discusses the main browser activities centered on in - formation retrieval , digital information management , and online collaboration . As the core function of the browser , information retrieval has received much attention from the research community . Centered on information retrieval , Byrne et al . [ 12 ] categorized web tasks into six classes : use information , locate on page , go to page , pro - vide information , configure browser , and react to environment . In a study specific to knowledge workers , Sellen et al . sorted on - line activities into six categories : finding , information gathering , browsing , transacting , communicating , and housekeeping [ 65 ] . Al - though studies have updated browsing categorization over the years , some common factors are suggested to understand browsing tasks . For instance , Kellar et al . examined the impact of web - based information - seeking tasks on users‚Äô browsing behavior and identi - fied three factors influencing the usage of navigation mechanisms : task session , task type , and individual differences [ 39 ] . Managing information within the browser has become an impor - tant function for the browser . As users are exposed to richer data than ever , the browser facilitates not only finding information but also saving and re - finding the information . Jones et al . [ 35 ] observed how users manage web information for re - use and concluded that users utilize diverse methods for maintaining information , such as bookmarking , pasting URLs , and retrieving history . Several con - siderations were brought up to understand how different methods‚Äô influence on users‚Äô choices , including portability ( whether a sav - ing method keeps the information portable ) , accessibility ( whether information can be assessed from multiple places ) , and reminding ( whether the method can remind the user about the relevance of When Browsing Gets Cluttered : Exploring and Modeling Browsing Clutter CHI ‚Äô23 , April 23 ‚Äì 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany a web page later on ) . Later , it was concluded that there is a need as tabbing . Previously , the increasing revisitation revealed that go - for multiple methods for information management co - existing to ing back and forth between pages relates to multitasking .

Patterns of browser feature usage years , multitasking is still a trend while the revisitation rate has have also been investigated , specifically with bookmark usage [ 1 , 4 ] decreased , which is seen to be replaced by the emerging use of and browsing history [ 71 ] , while usage of both features has been tabbing function [ 78 ] . The early work of Tauscher and Greenberg observed to decrease over the years [ 52 ] . The decreasing trend of [ 71 ] in 1997 found that revisiting browsing pattern accounted for traditional means of information management , such as bookmark - 58 % of the visited pages . Since then , revisition has been identified ing , reflects users‚Äô shift to evolving tabbed browsing [ 15 , 52 ] . as a prevalent behavior , and the revisitation rate was updated in Currently , online collaboration can be considered as one of the Mckenzie and Cockburn‚Äôs work to 81 % [ 20 ] . The calculation of major browsing tasks . Since a decade ago , users started to use web revisitation rate was updated with tabbed browsing taken into ac - intensively for collaboration work , as revealed in a study by Morris count by Zhang and Zhao [ 82 ] . They reported revisiting rates of [ 49 ] , and now web - based browsing facilitates easier document shar - 39 . 9 % using the conventional approach and 59 . 6 % when tabbed ing , streaming video watching , remote meetings , and studying .

The increas - to understand the dynamic nature of browsing behavior . Based on ing capacity of everyday technologies to store data has impacted longitudinal search logs , White and Drucker [ 80 ] classified users user behavior and experiences . Much prior research has focused into two extremes , navigators and explorers . Within this spectrum , on the overwhelming experiences of users while they interact with navigators are seen to be more consistent in their searching strate - information . Many of these studies argue that the disorganized , gies , that is , they follow a more direct path from query to problem stressful and cluttered experiences of users are due to the technolo - resolution . User demographics have also been considered as catego - gies they interact with . Here , we discuss relevant topics for web rization criteria by Weber and Jaimes [ 77 ] , who analyzed query logs browsing experiences . and identified differences in search behavior across demographic Information overload is a widely used but fairly abstract concept . groups in terms of searching topics . For example , baby boomers Graf and Antoni [ 29 ] define it as ‚Äúa state of being overwhelmed by were found to be more interested in finance - related topics , whilst information , where one perceives that information demands exceed white males search more about business and home - related topics . one‚Äôs information processing capacity‚Äù . In a recent meta - analysis on Regional search differences were also found to correlate with the information overload , they found that information overload occurs local industries , such as gambling - related queries near Las Vegas . in many contexts ( e . g . , different professions ) and that it contributes In contrast to segmenting users into groups , Crichton et al .

In contrast , technology overload [ 38 ] refers attention . The changes in revisitation patterns are seen to reflect to a situation in which additional technology begins to interfere the trend of multitasking and browser function development , such users‚Äô productivity . Further , it involves three dimensions , which CHI ‚Äô23 , April 23 ‚Äì 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Ma , et al . information processing resources . However , differences result from the diversity of contexts in which information overload appears . Summary . Many studies have investigated information over - load that people experience in the digital world . Studies point to different forms of clutter experienced by users while web browsing , such as tabs , ads , pop - ups , and the sheer amount of information available through the web . At the same time , many studies point to the changes in how people use browsers , such as changes in browsing tasks , devices , and usage of browser functions . It seems that users can experience information overload in diverse ways , and many changes in web browsing behaviors could account for it . However , the overall phenomenon how users experience clutter during browsing is still unclear . In this paper , we examine how users experience clutter while web browsing . We explore the forms and sources of clutter within the context of web browsing and the strategies users adopt to cope with it . Our study consists of two stages . In Study 1 , we interviewed 16 participants to explore and conceptualize a qualitative under - standing of what users experience as clutter during web browsing and what do they do in those situations . In Study 2 , we collected quantitative survey data informed by the results of Study 1 to fur - ther understand and model interactions between different forms of cluttered experiences and users‚Äô browsing behaviors . combine different overloading experiences : information overload , communication overload , and system feature overload . Lee et al . [ 44 ] examined social networking services ( SNS ) and found that all three dimensions are significant stressors , which influence users‚Äô fatigue in using SNS . Another study on SNS [ 62 ] concluded that the number of friends significantly affects perceived tweet overload , while the number of received tweets did not have this effect . What is common to all of these concepts is that they refer to overwhelming experiences of users when their information processing capacities are exceeded . Another concept that refers to information overload - like experi - ences is digital hoarding . It is defined as ‚Äúaccumulation of digital files to the point of loss of perspective , which eventually results in stress and disorganization‚Äù [ 70 , 76 ] . Sweeten et al . [ 70 ] investi - gated users‚Äô digital hoarding behaviors and found that significant reasons for hoarding were insufficient time and lack of motivation . The negative effects of hoarding included impaired productivity and negative emotions , such as stress and anxiety . Furthermore , Vitale et al . [ 76 ] found opposing tendencies in hoarding , such that users have tendencies to hoard because of reasons such as emo - tional attachment to the data or burden of organizing and managing the amount of data . At the same time , users tend to minimize the amount of data they store or interact with to avoid the negative effects caused by accumulation of files . In context of web browsers , one identified form of cluttered experience is tab overload , which refers to a feeling of having too many open browser tabs [ 15 , 16 ] . The utility of tabs to the task and the ease of opening them can lead to tab overload . A recent study by Chang et al . [ 15 ] identified pressures to close tabs , such as limited attention and screen space , and pressures to keep tabs open , such as using them as reminders or avoiding costs of re - finding a page . Apart from tabs , web page contents and their layout can also influence overload experiences . Overload of unnecessary or unus - able information displayed on web pages increases the information waste and burden of the browsing experience [ 2 ] . Others point out to digital clutter , which influences information overload [ 74 ] . Advertisements and pop - ups are also reported as sources account - ing for clutter and stealing users‚Äô attention [ 7 , 30 , 37 ] . Web pages are dynamic , which makes information retrieval challenging to users , as it is difficult for users to go back to the exact same page location [ 78 ] . Moreover , challenges caused by devices have been also studied , among which the mobile devices have received much attention . Currently , many people use mobile devices to browse the internet , which has led to research on mobile browsing experiences . For example , Shrestha [ 66 ] evaluated the usability of browsing on mo - bile devices and desktops , and concluded that users‚Äô performance and experience is worse on mobile devices due to the difficulty of browsing long narrow content . Various similar concepts and studies show that overwhelming and cluttered experiences are common to users . Although there are many concepts that all refer to similar experiences , we see that they have commonalities and differences . In the most abstract sense , they all seem to concern information overload , that is , negative ex - periences ( mainly stress ) caused by information demands exceeding 3 STUDY 1 METHOD : INTERVIEW Our study began with an initial question about how people experi - ence and perceive clutter while browsing online , and what browsing behaviors contribute to it . We chose the method of semi - structured interview for its flexibility in combining theory - laden question design with collecting data that is grounded in participants‚Äô experi - ences [ 26 ] . To select participants , we conducted an online screening survey ( ùëÅ = 53 ) . We invited participants based on inclusion criteria of spending more than 10 hours on browser weekly and residing in Finland , regardless of whether browsing clutter is a problem for them . A convenience sample of 32 participants were invited , and 17 of them agreed to participate in the interview . The screening survey was advertised using Facebook advertisements and the university‚Äôs official channel in LinkedIn . We balanced our interview sample ( ùëÅ = 16 ) by gender . Following the university research guidelines , participants were provided with an information sheet and data privacy notice , and a signed consent was obtained before each interview . The demographic information of interview participants is demonstrated in Table 1 . Interview procedure . Semi - structured interviews were con - ducted remotely using a video conferencing tool ( Microsoft Teams ) from late July to August 2021 by the first author . Each interview lasted for 60 - 75 minutes and was compensated with a ‚Ç¨20 electronic gift card . Out of 17 interview responses , one interview was excluded because it turned out that the participant rarely used a web browser . All interviews were audio recorded and resulted in 1193 minutes of audio in total , which were manually transcribed by the first two authors for interview coding .

P8 was excluded because the participant rarely used a web browser . The interview questions covered predefined topics , including general browsing behavior , browsing tasks , and cluttered expe - riences during web browsing . Each interview topic was covered by one to three scripted questions and follow - up questions to un - cover participants‚Äô reflections on their web browsing experience and strategies . For example , we explored participants‚Äô web brows - ing behavior using questions , such as ‚ÄúHow often do you clean up your tabs and windows ? ‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhen do you close the unnecessary ones ? ‚Äù Qualitative analysis . The qualitative data analysis of the in - terviews primarily followed the thematic analysis methodology [ 8 ] . The initial research questions that the analysis sought to answer were RQ1 ) ‚ÄúWhat participants experience as a clutter during web browsing ? ‚Äù , RQ2 ) ‚ÄúWhat behaviors , preferences and factors influ - ence the participants‚Äô experiences of clutter ? ‚Äù , and RQ3 ) ‚ÄúWhat do the participants do when they experience something as clut - ter ? ‚Äù The coding procedure combined inductive and deductive ap - proaches . This approach was chosen because our research questions were exploratory by nature , and we were interested in all forms of cluttered experiences by participants and the meanings they gave to those experiences . Meanwhile , our analysis was also informed by prior literature , as reviewed in the Background and Related work section . Initially , the first two authors independently coded two different interviews . After this step , they discussed their codebooks to agree on the high - level code categories and proceeded to code the remain - ing interviews independently . During the coding process , they had a series of daily meetings to discuss and agree on the evolving code categories and refine the common codebook . Finally , the first two authors together generated themes based on recurring patterns of meaning across the participants . To generate themes that answer the research questions , the codes were inter - preted against contexts , actions , and consequences of experiences of clutter that were present in participants‚Äô descriptions . For example , after coding the transcripts , codes representing con - text , such as ‚Äúhave many tabs‚Äù along with others , and consequences , such as ‚Äúnegative emotion‚Äù or ‚Äúlose control of browsing task‚Äù along with others , were interpreted against RQ1 to generate the theme ‚Äútoo many tabs experienced as clutter . ‚Äù The same procedure was applied to all the research questions . We did not set any criteria for the frequency of occurrence for the themes , but rather tried to identify diverse yet distinct , meaningful answers to the research questions . The semi - structured interview guideline is described in Appendix E . In the following sections , we report results based on the subset of the interview data . 4 STUDY 1 : RESULTS This section presents the themes generated from 16 semi - structured interviews that covered topics of challenges and overall feelings of users interacting with their current browser , general browsing behavior , browsing tasks , and working preferences regarding mul - titasking ( See Figure 1 for an overview of the themes ) . We present the themes that are associated to same research question together by sections . 4 . 1 Forms of browsing clutter Interview participants often referred to the recurring negative expe - riences related to clutter , which we conceptualized and categorized into three forms : the amount of open tabs or windows , web content and interactive elements , and navigation and information searching process . 4 . 1 . 1 Amount of open windows and tabs experienced as clut - ter . Browsing clutter was often perceived as an excessive number of browser windows or tabs . On a typical day , a majority of partici - pants ( 13 / 16 ) had one or two open browser windows , and between 10 and 20 open browser tabs . Only two participants experienced extremes : P14 had a minimalist approach that keeps the amount of tabs below three , and P1 had around 400 open tabs at a time . It was common for the participants to have an approximate number of tabs after which they started to feel uncomfortable ( P1 - 7 , P10 , P12 ) . We define this number as the tab limit . Participants described that they feel annoyed or stressed once the number of browser tabs surpasses this limit . Even when participants did not explicitly refer to a tab limit , they reported deterioration of their browsing experience when the visual cues become unclear ( e . g . , the title becomes too small to read CHI ‚Äô23 , April 23 ‚Äì 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Ma , et al . Figure 1 : Forms , sources , and coping of browsing clutter . Based on our interviews , we conceptualize cluttered experiences into three forms . We identify several sources of browsing clutter . Finally , we show how users deal with browsing clutter in their daily lives . or only the favicons are shown ) , or the moment when they lose track of the big picture of tasks they are working on ( P13 , P15 , P17 ) . In addition to tabs , windows can contribute to the clutter by allowing more tabs to be opened into multiple windows : ‚ÄúIt can also end up with just having two win - dows but too many tabs [ on ] each [ window ] , and then three windows with too many tabs [ on ] each [ window ] , ‚Äù ‚Äì P1 . 4 . 1 . 2 Web content and interactive elements experienced as clutter . Web content and interactive elements were mentioned as contributing factors to the browsing clutter and negative feelings that arise during web browsing . Such elements include distracting visual and audio elements that prevent participants from locating the answers they are looking for . Within the web content , too many ads on a website was one of the common cases that distracted sensemaking process ( P1 , P2 , P5 , P6 , P12 , P14 ) . For instance , P14 described feeling confused by ads on web pages and having difficulties in distinguishing them from actual content on the page . Other web page elements contributing to browsing clutter included sudden sounds from websites for which they cannot find the source , pop - up notifications , cookies that they have to accept , automatically jumping page for online meetings , and disorganized information on web pages ( P3 , P10 , P12 , P14 , P16 ) . In some cases , even useful interactive elements created the op - posite effect . Participants expressed that visual cues , such as tab favicons , titles , and position in the tab bar , are helpful to locate the right tab among open tabs . However , they can also become a problem when users had several tabs open with the same favicons ( P15 , P17 ) . 4 . 1 . 3 Search and navigation process experienced as clutter . Half of our participants described the web search as an iterative process . The process starts with the first general query , which is then narrowed down to a specific term , as users gather more information . One of our participants compared this process to a puzzle : ‚ÄúI cannot be sure that the correct information is there , but I can piece [ it together ] , basically it‚Äôs like a mosaic , it‚Äôs like a puzzle from many smaller information pieces . [ . . . ] I cannot be very sure that I will find everything that I need , but I might find the direction , ‚Äù - P13 . During this search process , various challenges interfered sense - making and lead to the browsing clutter . Some mentioned web searching challenges , such as getting side - tracked by other top - ics along the way , forgetting how to trace back to the tab they started from ( P1 , P2 , P5 , P15 ) , and having too much or contradicting information to evaluate ( P1 - 3 , P5 , P6 , P11 , P13 , P14 , P16 , P17 ) . Navigation can also be challenging . For example , participants mentioned having difficulties in attempting to re - find information in a complex website hierarchy ( P17 ) , or forgetting open tabs and navigating among them not knowing ‚Äúwhere the tab is and why the tab is there‚Äù ( P1 , P2 , P5 , P15 ) . 4 . 2 Sources of browsing clutter Our participants described their browsing tasks , behaviors , and browser usage in relation to perceived clutter experience . This sec - tion summarizes how these factors contribute to browsing clutter . 4 . 2 . 1 Task environment contributes to browsing clutter . The browsing tasks were often mentioned in relation to the browsing experience and perceived clutter . From the interviews , we thema - tized the following characteristics of browsing tasks : complexity , importance , and duration . Most of the participants also reported that they needed or preferred to multitask , which has an effect on the clutter they experience . Task complexity . Complex browsing tasks were often initiated with ill - defined problems , that is , either the starting position , the When Browsing Gets Cluttered : Exploring and Modeling Browsing Clutter CHI ‚Äô23 , April 23 ‚Äì 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany allowable operations , or the goal state was not clearly specified , or a unique solution could not be shown to exist [ 21 ] . Tasks that are ill - defined problems require searching , evaluating , and synthesizing new information . Such complex tasks are usually associated to creative work ( P9 , P16 ) and rapid growth of tab amount ( P2 , P4 ) due to information gathering : ‚ÄúThere are moments that they grow quite expo - nentially , like up to 20 , 30 . [ . . . ] I have a problem and I start to open several tabs to search for solu - tions to my problem or better way to implement something and so that‚Äôs the moment where it grows a lot . ‚Äù - P2 . On the contrary , searches for tasks that are not ill - defined can be evaluated quickly and associated tabs closed immediately . Examples of such tasks include debugging with assistance of Stack Overflow ( a question and answer platform ) ( P6 , P7 ) and finding instructions for specific topics , such as information on university applications ( P10 ) or a cooking recipe ( P5 , P14 ) . Task importance . Participants were more cautious about clos - ing tabs associated to important tasks , such as work or research ( P4 , P9 , P13 ) . In contrast , web pages related to less important tasks , such as entertainment , could be easily closed ( P2 , P4 , P5 ) : ‚ÄúIn work or research , definitely autonomy [ to close tabs ] is important , but for casual things , I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll need very much autonomy , ‚Äù - P4 . The importance of tasks was also mentioned when participants discussed browsing on different devices . Mobile devices were usu - ally used only for casual browsing for some participants ( P4 , P9 ‚Äì 11 , P13 , P16 ‚Äì 17 ) , and such casualness made participants less worried about opening and closing web pages . Task duration . Tasks can take from seconds to months to com - plete , and the life cycle of task - relevant tabs can range accordingly . For small tasks , such as looking for a specific answer , tabs were evaluated quickly , and the decision to keep or close them was made quickly ( P3 ‚Äì P6 , P9 , P15 ‚Äì P17 ) . When tasks required more time , the tabs associated to them stayed open longer until participants pro - cessed or saved the important information ( P2 , P5 , P9 , P13 , P17 ) . In addition , there were long - term projects , which lasted from weeks to months ( P16 ) . Multitasking during web browsing . Almost all participants shared the need to work on concurrent tasks during browsing ( P1 , P3 - 7 , P9 - 11 , P14 - 17 ) . Such needs include parallel work requests , spontaneous task switching , or interruptions . Furthermore , as a working style , most interviewees ( 13 / 16 ) multitasked during web browsing , which often involved switching between tabs back and forth , and consequently facing browsing clutter . Six participants ( P4 , P7 , P11 , P13 , P15 - 16 ) reported that they always multitasked , the other seven participants did so occasionally . For people who multitask occasionally , multitasking can be triggered by interrup - tions , such as emails or calls ( P3 , P6 ) . Multitasking also happens when new ideas emerge from the search unrelated to the current project ( P2 , P9 ) . For multitasking during browsing , users relied both on the tabs and windows but also cognitive resources , such as working memory and attention ( P15 , P16 ) . This created clutter , as ‚ÄúThe mind doesn‚Äôt switch as fast as the tabs can be switched‚Äù ( P15 ) . 4 . 2 . 2 Information management habits contribute to clutter . The participants use browsers for several functions besides finding information . Notably , participants use the browser to organize their task - related information and to store web pages for varying periods of time . The way participants use their browser for information management influences the clutter they encounter . Using browser windows and tabs to organize information . Organizing browser windows and tabs acts as a popular way for information management . Approximately half of the participants used multiple windows to organize tasks ( P1 - 3 , P5 , P9 - 10 , P13 , P16 ) . Some participants used different windows to distinguish between personal and work - related browsing ( P9 , P10 , P12 , P15 , P17 ) , and others divided windows by topics ( P3 , P5 , P7 ) . Ordering tabs was another common organizing technique . Par - ticipants tended to order tabs from left to right based on usage frequency ( P3 , P5 , P7 , P10 , P14 , P16 ) or group tabs by topics ( P4 , P6 , P11 , P13 ) . However , those strategies of organizing could have the opposite effect and increase instead of reducing browser clutter . For example , P1 reported opening new windows but then filling each with too many tabs . Using browser features to store information . Half of the par - ticipants ( P1 , P3 - 4 , P7 , P9 , P13 , P16 ) use tabs as a space for temporary saving their web pages . This approach is usually adopted when performing complex tasks that are not well - defined , and users uti - lize tabs as the place to park their thoughts until they conclude the task . In this case , the tab is seen as a temporary option com - pared to bookmarks that seem as a way of saving more important information and for longer term : ‚ÄúFor the searching tabs they are temporary tabs . I do not want to save all the temporary tabs in the folder as the bookmarks , ‚Äù - P7 . The use of bookmarks was described mainly as a way to save important information , while one participant used it as a way to get rid of excessive tabs : ‚ÄúI use bookmarks sometimes I‚Äôm just like OK , save all of those tabs to bookmarks and then I‚Äôll just close the window to get rid of the hundreds of tabs , ‚Äù - P1 . However , transferring multiple tabs into bookmark was not al - ways seen as a productive approach to the overall browsing experi - ence . Participants described that the web pages they save tend to become irrelevant or useless afterwards : ‚ÄúCause probably most things are going to be too out of date , anyways [ not ] worth going back to , ‚Äù - P1 . 4 . 2 . 3 Users have strategies to manage clutter . The partici - pants discussed different habits in terms of what do they do to their unnecessary tabs and when do they close them . As the number of tabs was experienced as clutter , their habits of managing the open tabs was associated to clutter . CHI ‚Äô23 , April 23 ‚Äì 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Ma , et al . Tab closing habits . We identified two common patterns related to closing tabs : 1 ) closing tab ( s ) when the task is completed , and 2 ) reactive closing , which is triggered by certain circumstances . The first pattern was more common ( 13 / 16 ) , and it heavily de - pended on the task . Tabs related to simple tasks could be closed quickly ( P1 , P3 , P6 ‚Äì 7 , P10 ‚Äì 11 , P14 ) . However , if a tab contains in - formation that requires reading and digesting , it can be saved for longer reflection ( P1 , P3 , P6 , P7 , P10 , P11 , P14 ) , even for months ( P16 ) . The second pattern , reactive closing , was mentioned by nine participants ( P2 ‚Äì 4 , P7 , P10 ‚Äì 12 , P16 , P17 ) . In some cases , closing tabs would be triggered by reaching the tab limit ( Section 4 . 1 . 1 ) ( P1 ‚Äì 3 , P5 , P10 ‚Äì 11 ) : ‚ÄúWhen I really catch myself opening 15 or 16 tabs , I go back and , see what tabs I can close‚Äù - P4 , Some participants described reactive closing as a cycle of opening new tabs until their amount reaches a tipping point . Sometimes , it can be triggered by negative emotions ( P3 , P5 , P15 ) : ‚ÄúI feel like it‚Äôs easier for me to have the tabs open until I get to a point where it just starts to be annoying , and then normally what I would do is I would close the whole window once I stopped working . And then the next time that I start work - ing [ . . . ] I just open a new window , and then I start accruing new tabs again , until I get frustrated and close the whole window again , ‚Äù - P3 . Users‚Äô habits seem to be combinations of these two patterns and vary from person to person . For example , even if the task was not complete , the number of accumulated tabs could exceed users‚Äô tab limit and forced them to start closing open tabs . These two patterns were interlinked . Although reactive closing is seen to be triggered by clutter , clutter sometimes emerges in the process of completing tasks . Dealing with tabs at the end of the day . Cleaning up the browser when work is done declutters browsing spaces . Conversely , leaving the working space unvisited potentially contributes to clut - ter . Two general strategies were identified : seven participants ( P6 ‚Äì 7 , P9 , P11 , P13 ‚Äì 14 , P17 ) usually shut down their computers , and the other nine ( P1 ‚Äì 5 , P10 , P12 , P15 ‚Äì 16 ) left the browser open and continued from where they stopped the next day . Most participants ( P1 ‚Äì 2 , P6 , P10 ‚Äì 14 , P17 ) would review the tabs at the end of the day and made sure there were no tabs open without a reason , regardless of whether they will shut down the browser . Hoarding tabs and leaving them unvisited at the end of the day was also common . Unvisited tabs could include tabs they had previously opened and forgot about them ( P3 ) , the tabs that no longer served their task ( P7 , P15 - 16 ) , or the tabs for which they did not have time ( P4 , P9 ) . 4 . 3 Strategies to cope with browsing clutter Many of our participants ( P5 , P10 , P13 , P15 ‚Äì P17 ) explicitly shared that their behavior had changed over the years , and reported some adaptive behavior to browsing clutter . In other words , they had adopted certain strategies to cope with browsing clutter , to prevent it from emerging or to reduce its negative effects when it emerges . We observed the following strategies : setting the boundaries , ad - justing the attitudes , and adopting browser tools designed to help managing browser resources . Next , we present these strategies in detail . 4 . 3 . 1 Setting the boundaries to cope with clutter . Limiting tab amount . Seven participants mentioned that when browsing they would intentionally limit the amount of open tabs and browser windows ( P2 ‚Äì 4 , P7 , P12 , P14 , P17 ) : ‚ÄúI try to keep the open tabs within like 11 or 12 so I can actually read what‚Äôs going on in each of the tabs . ‚Äù - P4 . Sometimes , the limiting happened unconsciously : ‚ÄúI‚Äôm realizing that unconsciously I‚Äôm regulating the amount of tabs that I have open . [ . . . ] I‚Äôm not like saying like , OK , it‚Äôs time to organize , I‚Äôm just automatically looking through the tabs , ‚Äù - P12 . Limiting the amount of tabs is highly associated to closing tab habits , which we presented in Section 4 . 2 . 3 . External constraints . External constraints were mentioned as the conditions that would prevent users from accumulating tabs . One such constraint was work deadlines . Some participants de - scribed that deadlines make them more focused and , hence , de - crease the tab amount ( P15 ‚Äì 16 ) . However , the effect of external constraints vary from person to person . For example , the time pres - sures showed opposite effect for five other participants ( P5 , P10 ‚Äì 11 , P13 , P17 ) who saw a growing trend of accumulated tabs with a tight deadline . 4 . 3 . 2 Adjusting the attitudes to cope with clutter . Taking cer - tain attitudes towards browsing clutter experience was mentioned as one of the strategies that helped coping with it . We asked partic - ipants if they had ever tried to improve their browsing experience . Four participants ( P4 ‚Äì 6 , P10 ) expressed an almost deterministic attitude about the amount of tabs they usually have , stating that there is nothing they can do to change the amount of tabs growing , or that it is related to the nature of their tasks . In contrast , other participants had an adaptive attitude to either prevent the amount of tabs from growing or adapt to losing information ( P5 , P9 ‚Äì 10 , P15 ‚Äì 16 ) : ‚ÄúSo maybe now I‚Äôve been trying to be more chill about this for a few years . And then if I really need it , I will search for it again , ‚Äù - P5 . Three participants ( P3 , P5 , P7 ) reported to have gotten used to browsing clutter , or that it was not an important enough problem for them to actively search for a solution : ‚ÄúYeah , of course it‚Äôs a problem , but it depends on the case . It‚Äôs not a very urgent problem , it‚Äôs not that serious . ‚Äù - P7 . 4 . 3 . 3 Adopting browser tools designed to help managing browser resources . When Browsing Gets Cluttered : Exploring and Modeling Browsing Clutter CHI ‚Äô23 , April 23 ‚Äì 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Browser extensions . When asked whether participants had tried any tools to help them manage their tabs , seven participants ( P2 - 7 , P11 ) explicitly stated that they had not looked into the matter and only three participants ( P1 , P10 , P15 ) named specific tab manage - ment browser extensions , such as SessionBuddy [ 11 ] or the Tree Style Tab [ 69 ] . However , all three participants noted that these tools did not help them enough when compared to the extra effort required to utilize them , so they had stopped using them at some point in the past . As P10 put it : ‚Äúit was like a new skill to , not skill , but like an - other things to remember to do , and to return it . And I give up‚Äù - P10 . Other participants ( P11 , P13 , P15 ) shared similar attitudes to - wards tab management tools although they had not tried any solu - tions yet . P11 stated that ‚Äú [ It ] feels like , it‚Äôs extra work to reduce the work in a way . ‚Äù Desired design features . When asked about desirable features of such tools in a hypothetical scenario , participants often men - tioned functions , such as grouping tabs according to topics ( P2 ‚Äì 7 , P10 , P11 , P14 , P15 ) , selecting and closing several tabs at once ( P15 ) , ordering them by visit frequency ( P12 ) , or scrunching unused tabs into one higher level tab or column ( P4 , P17 ) . Other mentioned fea - tures included drag - and - drop options to open a page in new tab ( P7 ) , having working spaces with default number of open pages ( P16 ) , or various graphic visualizations of tabs , such as tree or network ( P1 ) or ‚Äúballs in a basket‚Äù ( P16 ) . 4 . 4 Follow - up survey study Based on the interview results , we found that the participants ex - perienced three forms of clutter during browsing : amount of tabs and windows , web page contents and interactive elements , and search and navigation process . We call these experiences browsing clutter since they all refer to the common context of experienc - ing clutter , yet they are distinct from each other . More formally , browsing clutter designates a group of associated experiences of clutter that users have while using browsers . The experiences of clutter are characterized by users feeling overwhelmed and stressed due to the accumulation and disorganization of browser elements and information . The experiences are associated as instances of information overload . To further understand the dynamics behind browsing clutter , that is , how clutter is experienced and how different groups of factors influence the cluttered experience , a follow - up study was conducted . In Study 2 , we investigated experiences of clutter by running a survey study . We operationalized the themes identified in Study 1 as factors that we intended to measure using Likert - scale survey items . The browsing clutter forms and the browsing habits that we generated as themes in Study 1 informed the survey design directly . Furthermore , as we found that participants in Study 1 showed strategies similar to coping strategies [ 6 , 25 ] in their ways to manage the cluttered experiences , we also decided to measure coping strategies using the Brief COPE inventory [ 13 ] . The scope of the following study was to extend the findings by modeling them quantitatively . With quantitative models , the interactions between browsing clutter forms and user habits could be better understood . 4 . 5 Limitations As a limitation , Study 1 was conducted during the COVID - 19 pan - demic , which has affected information work and browsing behav - iors making people rely more on digital devices [ 63 ] . 5 STUDY 2 METHOD : ONLINE SURVEY To further understand browsing clutter , we conducted a survey study ( ùëÅ = 400 ) which was informed by the results of our interview study . We had two research questions : RQ1 ) What is the structure of browsing clutter ? and RQ2 ) How browsing habits and coping strategies affect browsing clutter ? 5 . 1 Participants and data quality We collected data through the Prolific platform . The survey was released with the Webropol survey software and was open between 24th of June to 11th of July 2022 . All respondents consented to data privacy and processing procedure following the university guidelines . Participants were selected based on the Prolific pre - screening question asking whether they used laptops or desktops on a daily basis . When the survey answers were successfully submitted to the system , we reviewed attention check questions , time used for filling the survey , and arbitrary answers to inspect data quality . In total , we received 400 valid survey answers , which were used as the dataset for further analysis . Table 2 demonstrates the basic demographic information of our survey participants . 5 . 2 Survey design and item generation Our survey design process consisted of three stages . First , the first two authors brainstormed the items separately , followed by three rounds of discussion and iteration . Next , the survey was reviewed by the other two authors and two other researchers to ensure sufficient motivation and communication clarity . Finally , we conducted a pilot test with 18 participants from social channel connections to pretest the survey length ( 20 minutes on average ) and identified flaws in the questions . During each stage , minor revisions were made to improve the answerability and clarity . Our survey consists of five sections . The first three sections were designed to investigate users‚Äô experience of browsing clutter , their browsing habits , and coping strategies to clutter using Likert - scale items ( 1 ‚Äì 7 ) . Section four has open - ended questions on users‚Äô perception of cluttered experiences , and section five focuses on user portrait questions . A complete survey description can be found in Appendix . The first three sections consist of Browsing behavior - how fre - quently people use the web browser in certain ways ( 19 items ) ; Browsing clutter - how frequently people experience cluttered situ - ations ( 19 items ) ; and Coping strategies - how users cope with the cluttered browsing experience ( 24 items ) . Items for the first two sections , browsing behavior and browsing clutter , were generated from interview coded themes . Reverse coding was adopted for some items in the first two sections to ensure answer consistency . Items on coping strategies were adapted from Brief COPE inventory [ 13 ] CHI ‚Äô23 , April 23 ‚Äì 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Ma , et al . Table 2 : Demographic characteristics of survey respondents ( N = 400 ) . Our sample is balanced between males ( 50 % ) and females ( 47 . 8 % ) with age groups of 18 - 24 ( 53 . 8 % ) and 25 - 34 ( 36 . 5 % ) as the majority . Most of the participants have a Bach - elor‚Äôs ( 51 . 3 % ) or High school degree ( 28 . 5 % ) . The majority of participants reside in Europe ( 56 . 3 % ) or Africa ( 26 . 0 % ) . The majority of participants are students . Occupations were cate - gorized following the International Standard Classification of Occupations [ 54 ] ; groups with more than 10 people are reported .

The list of items for sections one , two and three can be found in the Appendix A ‚Äì C . Section four consists of questions on how people perceive clut - ter affecting their lives and how serious was the problem in their view . Section five supplements the user profile through basic de - mographic and browser usage questions . The sections progress from concrete questions to more abstract ones ; logically , later sections would require reflection on previous ones . Within each section , the order of items was randomized to minimize the order effect of items . 6 STUDY 2 : RESULTS Our results show that browsing clutter consists of four intercor - relating forms . Several browsing behaviors and coping strategies predict an increase in browsing clutter . Most participants perceive browsing clutter as a minor problem , but there are differences in experiences of negative emotions compared to those who perceive Figure 2 : Number of open tabs during web browsing . The majority of participants have commonly 5 ‚Äì 10 tabs open . Figure 3 : Number of open windows during web browsing . The majority of participants have commonly 1 ‚Äì 3 windows open . it as a serious problem . Further , browsing clutter often occurs in contexts of work - related and research tasks . This section presents the results of our online survey analysis in three parts . We first present descriptive results that outline how our participants use web browsers and how they perceive the problems with clutter during web browsing . Second , we uncover the struc - tures of browsing clutter , browsing behaviors , and coping strategies using exploratory factor analysis . Third , we use multivariate re - gression with factor scores from step two to model what behaviors and coping strategies affect browsing clutter . The quantitative data analysis for the survey was done using R . 6 . 1 Web browser usage Survey participants were asked about the primary browser they use . Among all browsers , Google Chrome dominated as a respondents‚Äô choice with a rate of 87 . 3 % , followed by Microsoft Edge at 26 . 5 % , Mozilla Firefox at 26 . 5 % , Safari at 15 . 5 % , Opera at 12 . 0 % , Internet Explorer at 8 . 3 % , DuckDuckGo at 2 . 3 % , and others at 9 . 5 % . When Browsing Gets Cluttered : Exploring and Modeling Browsing Clutter CHI ‚Äô23 , April 23 ‚Äì 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Figure 4 : Users‚Äô perception on the seriousness of browsing clutter . Most participants reported clutter to be a minor problem for themselves . This can be seen from the cumulative percentage of scores 1 ‚Äì 4 covering over 75 % of the answers . The scale used is 1 ‚Äì 7 representing from not a problem to serious problem . Figures 2 and 3 show the number of tabs and windows users have open on average during web browsing . The majority of people usually have 5 ‚Äì 10 tabs ( 52 . 8 % ) and 1 ‚Äì 3 windows ( 79 . 5 % ) open . We asked the participants what are their common purposes of using tabs . The options presented were from literature [ 24 ] . The most popular answer is to use tabs for ‚Äúmultitasking‚Äù ( 60 . 5 % ) , followed by using tabs as a ‚Äúshort - term bookmark‚Äù ( 46 . 8 % ) , as ‚Äútask reminder‚Äù ( 45 . 0 % ) , to ‚Äúopen links in the background‚Äù ( 45 . 8 % ) and to ‚Äúcompare results and go back and forth‚Äù ( 47 . 3 % ) . Some participants ( 31 . 5 % ) also use tabs to ‚Äúmark frequently used pages‚Äù . When asked about the behavior of starting a new browsing session , 45 . 8 % of the participants reported that they will start with a fresh browser without any open tab , while the others will continue with a new tab following where they left ( 45 . 5 % ) , or start with a new browser window but leave the opened web pages behind ( 8 . 7 % ) . 6 . 2 Perceptions of browsing clutter Participants were asked to rate the seriousness of browsing clutter as a problem for themselves on a 7 - point Likert - scale . Figure 4 illustrates that 18 % of participants do not regard it as a problem at all ( Likert - scale 1 ) , the majority ( 57 . 2 % ) rate it as a mild problem ( 2 ‚Äì 4 ) and near one - fourth ( 24 . 8 % ) rate it as a somewhat or serious issue ( 5 ‚Äì 7 ) . Following the seriousness rating , participants were asked ‚ÄúHow does cluttered browsing affect your daily life‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat are the situations where you experience clutter in web browsing‚Äù as open - textfield questions . Answering the open - ended questions was op - tional ; hence , the number of responses associated with the codes does not sum up to 400 . How does cluttered browsing affect users‚Äô daily lives ? We received 363 answers for the‚ÄúHow does cluttered browsing affect your daily life ? ‚Äù question . We divided answers into two groups ‚Äì people who regard browsing clutter as a mild or not a problem ( rating < = 4 ; number of answers : 270 ) versus a relatively serious problem ( rating > 4 ; number of answers : 93 ) ‚Äì with the goal to compare whether clutter has a different effect to participants with different perceptions of browsing clutter . In the mild problem group ( ùëõ = 270 ) , many participants did not perceive the clutter as a prob - lem at all ( 180 / 270 ) . They reported rarely experiencing cluttered browsing , or that the situation does not influence them much . As we focused on how the clutter occurs to users , we only coded those who considered clutter as a problem as relevant answers ( ùëõ = 90 ) . We coded the open - ended answers with an inductive approach . We kept the coding procedure open without searching with pre - defined themes , and the codes were not informed by study 1 . The coding procedure starts with familiarization of all answers from both groups . Then , initial codes were generated . During this phase , codes were shared in both groups for answers with shared meaning ( e . g . , There were respondents mentioning ‚Äúfeeling stressed‚Äù due to clutter in both group and the same code ‚ÄúStressed‚Äù were applied ) . We then searched for themes separately from answers in both groups . Although clutter is perceived as a problem at different levels of seriousness , similar consequences of the cluttered browsing ex - perience were identified in both groups . Clutter is thematized as influencing users through two aspects : 1 ) causing problems that challenge browsing and 2 ) arising negative emotions . Figure 5 demonstrates the code groups for these two themes with occur - rence frequencies . In addition to the same themes , the two groups also show similarities as well in terms of experience and frequency . However , people who perceive it as a more serious problem re - ported more concrete challenges , such as hardware problems ( e . g . , computer crashes ) , and information that is hard to navigate . What are the situations where users experience clutter in web browsing ? For the question of ‚ÄúWhat are the situations where you experience clutter in web browsing ? ‚Äù , we applied the coding procedure to 354 answers that we received . Our survey respondents reported situations of experiencing clut - ter around task attributes including search topic , time pressure , task workload , and task type . More demanding tasks are seen to be asso - ciated with clutter . For example , tasks that are more complex than just a simple fact - finding search will easily lead to accumulation , ‚Äúwhen I was doing research for projects or for a paper . Then the tabs start looking like stacked up ants , and you can‚Äôt really differentiate between the tabs . ‚Äù Moreover , clutter is also experienced as interface - level visual chaos , where users reported : ‚ÄúWhen the content of the web page I‚Äôm consulting is all stack in an unorganized way . ‚Äù CHI ‚Äô23 , April 23 ‚Äì 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Ma , et al . Figure 5 : Generated themes : browsing clutter affects people through browsing challenges and negative emotions . Partic - ipants answers were coded separately between groups that reported minor vs . serious problems with browsing clutter . Both groups reported negative emotions associated to clut - tered situations , while the group with serious problems re - ported more effects that clutter has on their lives . The gener - ated themes are represented here as clusters of codes . Such unorganized content and unwanted content on the display , such as ads , contribute to the cluttered experience . Based on those self - reported situations , two themes were gener - ated : ‚ÄúClutter is experienced under demanding tasks‚Äù and ‚ÄúClutter Table 3 : Browsing clutter factor correlation matrix . All the factors correlate with each other moderately . is experienced as interface - level visual chaos‚Äù . 6 . 3 Structure of browsing clutter The main focus of our analysis was to explore what is the structure of browsing clutter ( that is , the three forms in Section 4 . 1 ) based on participants‚Äô responses to our survey , and how browsing clutter is related to browsing behaviors and habits , and coping strategies towards it . To answer these questions , we used exploratory factor analysis ( EFA ) [ 68 ] following a similar procedure that has been ap - plied in studies for understanding how and why people use certain technologies [ 34 , 46 ] . In this paper , we used EFA to estimate latent structures ( browsing clutter ) and to reduce dimensions and account for multicollinearity of variables ( browsing behaviors and coping strategies ) . For all the analyses , we used the full dataset ( ùëÅ = 400 ) with no missing values . For all sections , we followed the procedure by Stevens [ 68 ] : We first tested the adequacy of our data for factor analysis using the Kaiser - Meyer - Olkin factor adequacy test , which gave good results ( > = . 80 ) , and Bartlett‚Äôs test of sphericity was statistically significant ( ùëù < . 001 ) . We then evaluated the appropriate number of factors for our models using scree plot and parallel tests with an eigenvalue of 1 as the decision criterion . When the appropriate number of factors was found , we applied factor analysis with the principal factor method and rotation depending on the section we were analyzing . We used oblique ‚ÄúPromax‚Äù rotation for browsing clutter variables , because we assumed that factors would correlate , as they did . For browsing behaviors and coping strategy variables , we used orthogonal ‚Äúvarimax‚Äù rotation , because we wanted to use the extracted factors as predictors in multivariate regression , and thus wanted to avoid multicollinearity . We iteratively excluded items from factor analysis models that had loading values lower than 0 . 30 and cross - loading to more than one factor greater than or equal to 0 . 30 . Finally , we evaluated the models based on the overall fit using the Tucker - Lewis index of factoring reliability ( ùëáùêøùêº ) ( > = . 90 ) , root mean square error of approx - imation ( ùëÖùëÄùëÜùê∏ùê¥ ) ( < . 06 ) , and interpretability of extracted factors . After the best models were decided , we interpreted the factor meanings based on the common themes in the items factorized . These resulting models are presented next by sections . The item loading matrices for browsing clutter , behavior , and coping sections are reported in Tables 4 ‚Äì 6 . 6 . 3 . 1 Browsing clutter . Based on the exploratory factor analysis , istinct factors with moderate factor our data consisted of four d correlations of . 27 ‚Äì . 50 .

We fitted a multivariate regression model with reported seriousness as depen - dent variable and browsing clutter factor scores as independent variables . Table 9 lists the details of the regression analysis . The results show that Navigation , Ads and Pop - ups , and Amount positively predict perceived seriousness of the problem . This means that the more participants suffer from browsing clutter , the more serious problem the clutter is for them . 6 . 5 Limitations Our survey data relies on participants‚Äô self - reports and thus is vulnerable to biases due to retrospection , self - evaluation , and self - selection to participate in the study . However , we did our best to minimize such effects by following good research practices . Our exploratory results are preliminary . Due to the focus on understanding clutter , the results may highlight behaviors that have increasing effects on browsing clutter . 7 DISCUSSION This paper presents two studies : an exploratory interview study and a quantitative survey . In our interview study , we investigated how people use web browsers and how they experience clutter during web browsing . In our survey study , we investigated what are the forms of browsing clutter and how browsing behaviors and coping strategies contribute to them . By investigating overloaded experiences of users with interview and survey studies , we were able to discover different forms of clutter , how clutter emerges from behavior , and how users deal with it . Our main findings were that users‚Äô experiences of clutter during browsing have different forms , which intercorrelate moderately . We identified certain browsing habits influencing the cluttered experiences and modeled the correlations between behavior and cluttered experience perception . In addition , we identified the strate - gies applied by users to cope with cluttered experiences . Our results highlight that to understand users‚Äô experiences of clutter during browsing , it is essential to study beyond clutter of tabs or ads . Browsing clutter consists of several related problems to browsing that need to be understood together . 7 . 1 Proposing browsing clutter ‚Äì What users experience as clutter ? Web browsers are used for managing and assisting users in differ - ent work contexts in addition to traditional web searching where the browser is only used for information retrieving . Many browser functions and extensions have been developed to serve such evolv - ing needs . However , features desired by users are different ( see Section 4 . 3 . 3 ) , and a simple add - up of isolated functions does not produce a smooth browsing journey . To understand the problems When Browsing Gets Cluttered : Exploring and Modeling Browsing Clutter CHI ‚Äô23 , April 23 ‚Äì 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Factor group : Browsing behaviors Factors ( Cronbach‚Äôs alpha ) Survey items ( Items marked with ( * ) are reverse coded ) Item mean ( ùëÜùê∑ ) Loading Organizing ( 0 . 685 ) I organize my bookmarks I organize my tabs I change the order of open tabs to help me locate them later 4 . 01 ( 2 . 18 ) 4 . 61 ( 1 . 90 ) 4 . 82 ( 2 . 00 ) 0 . 447 0 . 857 0 . 647 Multitasking ( 0 . 676 ) I work on multiple tasks at the same time I focus on one task at a time ( * ) I switch between different tasks 4 . 98 ( 1 . 55 ) 4 . 20 ( 1 . 60 ) 5 . 35 ( 1 . 36 ) 0 . 774 0 . 598 0 . 551 Accumulating tabs ( 0 . 615 ) I will keep tabs open until I feel there are too many I tend to close unnecessary tabs constantly ( * ) I close tabs associated to a certain task immediately once I finish it ( * ) I open web pages to look at them later but never revisit them 4 . 26 ( 2 . 07 ) 3 . 02 ( 1 . 76 ) 2 . 71 ( 1 . 59 ) 3 . 60 ( 1 . 74 ) 0 . 731 0 . 514 0 . 465 0 . 387 Cautious tab closing ( 0 . 511 ) I will check if I still need the tab before closing it I will close the browser window without checking it ( * ) I keep open all tabs that I see as potentially relevant When I‚Äôm done with web browsing , I will go through all the tabs that 5 . 68 ( 1 . 48 ) 5 . 15 ( 1 . 73 ) 5 . 60 ( 1 . 44 ) 3 . 95 ( 1 . 95 ) 0 . 630 0 . 582 0 . 367 0 . 315 are open Working spheres within browser ( 0 . 453 ) I use different browser windows within the same browser to distinguish tasksIusedifferent browsers to distinguish my work and personal browsing activities 4 . 12 ( 2 . 12 ) 3 . 17 ( 2 . 23 ) 0 . 504 0 . 432 Table 5 : Survey items and item loadings of browsing behavior factors . We aimed at reducing the dimensions of our variables with EFA to use the factor scores in regression analysis . We labeled the groups as Organizing behavior , Multitasking , Accumulating tabs , Cautious tab closing , and Working spheres within browser , since these are the common themes among the groups of items . Items with a loading below . 30 were excluded iteratively from the factor models . Internal consistencies of the factors ( ùõº = . 45 ‚àí . 69 ) were below the common acceptable cutoff . This might imply that behavior factors do not measure unidimensional behaviors . However , as factor loadings and overall fit of the model ( ùëáùêøùêº = . 90 , ùëÖùëÄùëÜùê∏ùê¥ = . 05 ) were good , we considered the factors acceptable for dimension reduction . faced by users , it is crucial to consider the broader context beyond designate quantity as one dimension of overload ( e . g . , quantity single browser functions , such as tabbing . of information in information overload [ 29 ] , volume of emails in We call browsing clutter a group of associated experiences of clut - email overload [ 23 ] , and the number of tabs in tab overload [ 15 ] ) , ter that users have while browsing online , which are characterized which closely relates to the amount of tabs and windows in our by users feeling overwhelmed and stressed due to the accumula - study . Web contents have been researched less , but ads and popups tion and disorganization of browser elements and information . We as one type of interactive elements ( e . g . , [ 7 , 30 , 37 ] ) have been conceptualized four forms of browsing clutter from the interview associated with clutter in previous studies . Search and navigation study and the EFA model of our survey items : 1 ) Amount of tabs have been extensively investigated in HCI ( e . g . , [ 17 , 43 , 56 , 78 ] ) , with and windows , 2 ) web page elements such as Ads and Pop - ups , 3 ) commonality that search and navigation place demands on users‚Äô Navigation within and across web pages , and 4 ) information Search . information processing . Our study supports the understanding that Notably , 3 ) and 4 ) were thematized as one theme in the interview overload experiences emerge during search and navigation as the study , while they were divided into separate forms based on EFA demands exceed the information processing capacity . Overall , we analysis . can observe that browsing clutter instantiates information overload In the EFA model that resulted from our data analysis , the brows - that occurs in the context of browsing .

We inter - different forms of browsing clutter have not been studied together pret this as an indication that the forms of browsing clutter interact in prior research , which is the main contribution of our work . with each other , although they are also relatively independent since With four interacting factors , it is clear that browsing clutter the analysis produced distinct factors . Thus , solely focusing on is a complex phenomenon combining different aspects of human - one form of browsing clutter misses the interaction effects of other computer interaction : navigation and search require planning and forms .

Browsing behaviors contribute to browsing clutter . Our stud - ies show that there are several behaviors and factors that contribute to browsing clutter . The regression model shows the dynamics of how browsing behaviors interact with browsing clutter . Figure 6 illustrates the statistical associations of browsing behavior factors in relation to browsing clutter . Figure 6 : The relationship between browsing behavior and browsing clutter experience . Multitasking , Accumulating tabs , Cautious tab closing habits , and Working spheres within browser behaviors predict browsing clutter . Browsing clutter factors intercorrelate with each other . A negative correlation is indicated with a dotted line , and the regression coefficients are marked with a significance p - value . Factor correlations are indicated with red lines . A thicker line corresponds to a larger coefficient value . In the model , Multitasking predicts the Amount of tabs and Search clutter . In the interviews , many users tended to multitask when browsing , due to either the nature of their work or their personal preferences . The high rate of multitasking is supported by previous research on online multitasking [ 67 ] . Such multitasking is enabled and motivated by the design of today‚Äôs browsers , which allow the use of tabs and multiple windows [ 24 , 32 ] . Moreover , the results reflect prior findings where online multitasking is associated to stress [ 47 ] . Accumulating tabs has been the focus of much interest in previ - ous research , which have examined the pressures to close and keep tabs [ 15 ] and reasons to use tabs [ 24 ] . In our model , this factor pre - dicts Navigation , Search and Amount clutter , which resembles the results by Chang et al . [ 15 ] that tabs are experienced as overload . In our model , a closely related aspect is the Cautious tab closing habit , which has a negative effect on Navigation and Search , indicating that closing tabs cautiously decreases the clutter . In the interviews , we identified two types of habits related to closing tabs : closing tabs when the task is done and reactive closing . Our results indicate that people who accumulate tabs in a reactive pattern and never close them until triggered by an external warning ( e . g . , browser crash or emotional stress ) experience more browsing clutter . Another habit that contributes to the accumulation of tabs is to leave the computer open at the end of the day . As the browser stays open and users simply continue from the web pages they left , they are likely to accumulate more web pages than those who shut down the browser more frequently and started browsing sessions from scratch . We can relate these habits to findings by Vitale et al . [ 76 ] who observed that users who tended to hoard digital data encounter costs of data management only when the amount of data became too large , while users who tended to be minimalist had to constantly invest and dedicate their time and effort to managing data . Importantly , the one factor that predicts all forms of browsing clutter is Working spheres within browser . This highlights how web browsers are used to structure work and that web browsers might not reflect users‚Äô complex task structures . Chang et al . [ 15 , 16 ] have investigated how tabs do not match users‚Äô mental models of a task . Earlier , Gonz√°lez and Mark [ 27 ] have argued that modern technology does not support cohesive task structure processing . They noted that people divide their work into thematic working spheres and switch between them constantly during the working day . All of these studies emphasize how important structuring is in browsing tasks and also in the general context of knowledge work . It is also interesting that Organizing behavior had no statistically significant effect on browsing clutter , in contrast to our expectations . Particularly , as the open - ended answers also imply that cluttered interfaces are a common context to browsing clutter , it is counter - intuitive that Organizing does not improve the situation . Task environment contributes to browsing clutter . In addi - tion to the behaviors included in the model , we identified from the interview and open - ended answers to the survey that task char - acteristics ( e . g . , complexity , importance , and duration ) contribute to browsing clutter . This is similar to the model of email overload by Dabbish and Kraut [ 23 ] where they found that email work im - portance influences email overload experience , while task variety CHI ‚Äô23 , April 23 ‚Äì 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Ma , et al . influences email work importance . Further , the open - text - field ques - tion in the survey study introduced another task characteristic , that is , the topic . Similarly , the significant influence of topic is shown by Renjith [ 58 ] , who identified news content as a specific topic that contributes to the experience of information overload . Overall , task characteristics affect the processing that the user engages in , as well as the support that they need from the browser to information man - agement , structuring , and storing . Studies on sensemaking have highlighted the significance of representations that users have and alter ( [ 57 , 60 ] ) , and how users are likely to prefer passive absorption of information or undirected browsing , as opposed to active and directed search for unknown topics [ 5 ] . As browsing tasks become more demanding , this increases the need for information management with the assistance of browser features . The complexity of coordinating co - existing information management methods creates even more challenges to maintaining a clean browsing environment . The diversity on the choice of in - formation management tool was also observed in a study by Jones et al . [ 35 ] . Further , as they stated , understanding how users make choices of information management methods can be a key step prior to proposing solutions . Our results highlight that browsers facilitate overlapping func - tions , such as information retrieval , communication , structuring information , and storing data . Thus , different forms of clutter and behaviors that contribute to them need to be investigated together to understand the browsing clutter . In the future , more investigations are needed into what other behaviors might contribute to increase or decrease of browsing clutter . Other behaviors , individual and social resources , skills , and other factors might affect both the browsing clutter experience and the seriousness of the problem for users . Discovering what other factors contribute to browsing clutter posits exciting opportunities for future research . 7 . 3 Coping with browsing clutter ‚Äì What users do when they experience clutter ? Users adapt their attitudes and behavior to cope with brows - ing clutter . From our interview , we learned that browsing clutter is an issue that most of our participants experience at least occa - sionally . However , not all of them considered it as a problem that they aimed to solve . However , we identified certain behaviors that some participants applied to prevent and address the emergence of browsing clutter , which can be compared with coping strategies [ 6 ] . The transactional theory of coping describes how the experience of stress is produced in the transaction of individuals and their environment [ 6 ] . Folkman and Lazarus define coping as ‚Äúcognitive and behavioral efforts to manage specific external and / or internal demands that are appraised as taxing or exceeding of the resources of the person‚Äù [ 25 , p . 310 ] . In the context of web browsing , adapt - ing the behavior or attitudes to the browsing clutter are types of coping that users do . Such coping strategies can be categorized into problem - focused and emotion - focused strategies [ 6 ] . In the interview results , constraints that were used as coping strategies can be categorized as problem - focused strategies . Man - aging browsing tasks and the resources needed for completing them , such as the web pages and their contents , drain cognitive Figure 7 : The relationship between browsing clutter experi - ence and coping strategies . Social support and Avoidance and negative expression predict browsing clutter , while Reframing and Active action predictions are pairwise . Browsing clutter factors intercorrelate with each other . A negative correlation is indicated with a dotted line , and regression coefficients are marked with a significance p - value . Factor correlations are indicated with red lines . A thicker line corresponds to a larger coefficient value . and perceptual resources . Examples of problem - focused coping strategies include limiting the number of open tabs intentionally , creating external constraints , and using a browser extension that provides a tool to manage tabs , since they all aim at altering the environment that drains the ( psychological ) resources [ 6 ] . In ad - dition , the concrete actions that users take in the act of browsing to prevent the problem from emerging are all problem - focused strategies . Interestingly , the limiting and constraining behaviors closely resemble email management tactics ( e . g . , limiting the size of inbox , and restricting checking email ) studied by Dabbish and Kraut [ 23 ] , which affect the experience of email overload . Moreover , in - formation overload has been associated with increased information avoidance [ 29 ] and strategies of filtering and withdrawing from information sources [ 64 ] . Thus , our findings indicate that these behaviors might reflect general information coping strategies . Other coping strategies reported by our participants can be cate - gorized as emotion - focused because they are aimed at regulating emotions arising from the stressful encounters with the browser [ 6 ] . Our participants mentioned adjusting some of their attitudes to - wards browsing clutter , including deterministic and adaptive atti - tudes ( see Section 4 . 3 . 2 ) . These seem to be emotion - focused coping strategies , as they are intended to reduce individuals‚Äô distress but do not alter the stressor , that is , the clutter . Coping strategies increase browsing clutter , while active coping has the opposite effect . Informed by our findings in the interview study , we included a measurement of coping strategies for browsing clutter with the Brief COPE inventory [ 13 ] in our survey When Browsing Gets Cluttered : Exploring and Modeling Browsing Clutter CHI ‚Äô23 , April 23 ‚Äì 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany study , which were further modeled to understand how people cope with the clutter they experience . Figure 7 shows the associations of browsing behaviors related to browsing clutter . The finding that Avoidance coping leads to increase in browsing clutter is intuitive , since avoiding the problem does not solve it , but sustains it for a longer time . More interestingly , Social support ( e . g . , turning to other people for emotional support or guidance ) has an increasing effect on almost all forms of browsing clutter . It is possible that social support behaves in a similar manner as avoidance , thus sustaining the problem . Notably , only the Active action coping habit has a statistically significant negative relation to Navigation . This indicates that the more participants engage in Active coping , the less they suffer from cluttered navigation . All other significant coping factors have posi - tive coefficients , suggesting that the more the participants engage in coping , the more they will suffer from browsing clutter . Thus , we might conclude that only Active coping in context of navigation is effective coping strategy , while other strategies either increase the cluttered experience or are inconclusively non - significant . Browsing clutter is minor problem to majority , but major to some . In our interviews , participants described clutter they ex - perienced , but their perceptions seemed to differ on whether the browsing clutter would be a serious issue to them . To examine this matter more closely , we included a final question in the survey focusing on how serious problem is the clutter during browsing to the participants . Most browsing clutter factors predict the seriousness of the prob - lem in our regression model . Thus , the increase in browsing clutter contributes to the user perceiving the clutter as a problem , which also makes sense intuitively : after all , browsing clutter measures the negative experiences that users have while browsing . In total , 24 . 7 % of our survey participants perceived browsing clutter as a serious problem . It indicates that although users might experience clutter while browsing , they are well adapted to it , or do not consider the experience as a problem that they would have means to solve [ see also 64 , p . 619 ] . Alternatively , as one of our interview participants ( P7 ) explained : ‚ÄúYeah , of course it‚Äôs a problem , but it depends on the case . It‚Äôs not a very urgent problem , it‚Äôs not that serious . I hope there‚Äôs no such issue , that would be better . But if the issue is there , I think it‚Äôs standable [ bearable ] for me . ‚Äù The overall model explains about 15 % of the variance in the perceived seriousness . This indicates that while browsing clutter factors measure experience of the clutter ( that is , negative experi - ences ) , it does not solely or exhaustively translate to a clear problem to users . It is likely that other factors also contribute to the users‚Äô considering clutter as a problem . Such factors could include users‚Äô personality characteristics , such as how strongly they react emo - tionally , or how strongly they react to the loss of control over tasks during clutter . Environmental factors , such as occupation and education , or cultural factors , such as how much productivity and tidiness are expected from individuals , might contribute to this phenomenon . These factors are supported by our open - ended answers , in which the fear of decrease in work productivity was reported , and negative emotions were reported more in the group that perceived clutter as a more serious problem . Overall , the results from our two studies show that browsing be - havior and adaptive coping have an effect on experience of clutter , which in turn sheds light on the adaptive and complex nature of cluttered user experience . However , the intercorrelation of brows - ing clutter factors highlights that increase in one form of browsing clutter might also cause increase in other forms of browsing clutter . 8 CONCLUSIONS We call browsing clutter the group of associated experiences of clut - ter that users have while browsing online and which cause them stress and overwhelm them . Together our two studies suggest that browsing clutter has several forms : the number of tabs and browser windows , the contents of web pages and interactive elements , and the navigation and search process . Our major contributions are as follows : 1 ) distinguishing between different forms of browsing clutter , 2 ) identifying browsing behaviors and coping strategies that contribute to browsing clutter , and 3 ) modeling the dynamics be - tween browsing behavior , browsing clutter experience and coping strategies . We conducted an exploratory study to explore what users ex - perience as clutter and what behaviors and factors affect their experiences . Prior research has focused on specific perspectives of browsing - related overload , such as tab overload [ 15 ] or web con - tents [ 33 ] , or investigated general information overload [ 29 ] . We re - alized that these perspectives explain only a part of the challenge to users . In our findings , we presented that our participants expressed discomfort about the number of tabs , annoying ads , difficulties in navigating web pages , and getting lost in searching specific infor - mation . Therefore , we reasoned that a wider perspective is needed to understand the cluttered browsing experience . Our studies indicate that cluttered experiences are distinct , but at the same time they have significant interactions . By evaluating tabs and windows in relation to their contents and the information search a user is engaged in , we can understand the user experience comprehensively . Significant prior research has been conducted on closely related issues , such as tab overload [ 15 ] , information overload [ 29 ] , digital clutter [ 70 , 76 ] , and personal data management [ 35 ] . However , our studies provide a framework to understand the interactions of cluttered experiences and user browsing behaviors . Further research is needed to solidify our proposed model . Based on our two studies , the browsing clutter interacts with user habits and behaviors , and their coping strategies . This indicates that users are adaptive and seek to address the problems they encounter when there are possible actions to take , and to adapt to situations when there are no perceivable actions to take . Overall , our studies highlight the adaptive nature of users and the browsing clutter phenomenon itself . The browsing clutter is a complex phenomenon that affects user behavior and user experi - ence ; moreover , the user behavior and coping affects how browsing clutter emerges and is felt by the user . In summary , our study emphasizes the diverse nature of the sources of clutter in web browsing experiences . Our two studies contribute to the understanding of browser clutter by conceptu - alizing and modeling the interactions between different cluttered experiences and behaviors . With better understanding of cluttered CHI ‚Äô23 , April 23 ‚Äì 28 , 2023 , Hamburg , Germany Ma , et al . experiences and user habits , we believe it is easier for users and designers to find effective strategies to declutter .
