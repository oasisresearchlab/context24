Innovative solutions of this kind depend on analogical reasoning , a relational reasoning process that involves mapping similarities between concepts . Brain - based evidence has implicated the frontal pole of the brain as important for analogical mapping . Separately , cognitive research has identiﬁed semantic distance as a key characteristic of the kind of analogical mapping that can support innovation ( i . e . , identifying similarities across greater semantic distance reveals connections that support more innovative solutions and models ) . However , the neural substrates of semantically distant analogical mapping are not well understood . Here , we used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) to measure brain activity during an analogical reasoning task , in which we parametrically varied the semantic distance between the items in the analogies . Semantic distance was derived quantitatively from latent semantic analysis . Across 23participants , activity in ana prioriregion of interest ( ROI ) in left frontopolar cortex covaried parametrically with increasing semantic distance , even after removing effects of task difﬁculty . This ROI was centered on a functional peak that we previously associated with analogical mapping . To our knowledge , these data represent a ﬁrst empirical characterization of how the brain mediates semantically distant analogical mapping . Keywords : analogy , anterior prefrontal , fMRI , mapping , relational integration The importance of understanding mechanisms that support innovation has long been recognized ( Sternberg 1977 ; Holyoak and Thagard 1995 ; Mayer 1999 ) and has recently been prioritized as imperative for scientiﬁc advancement ( Schunn et al . 2006 ) . A National Science Foundation report concluded that impending crises in science and engineering demand stronger characterization of reasoning processes that integrate concepts from disparate ﬁelds in order to identify innovative solutions ( Schunn et al . 2006 ) . Although operationalizing this directive poses experimental challenges , cognitive research has identiﬁed some factors that are likely to be relevant . For example , in analogical reasoning ( e . g . , Kitten is to Cat as Spark is to Fire ) , surface - level dissimilarity , or semantic distance , between the items being compared ( e . g . , the semantic distance from [ Kitten : Cat ] to [ Spark : Fire ] ) characterizes the nonobvious analogical connections that can shed valuable new light ( Holyoak and Thagard 1995 ; Green et al . 2008 ) . Evidence from a range of ﬁelds indicates that ﬁnding semantically distant connections between items that seem different but have important underlying similarities is an effective vehicle for innovation ( Holyoak and Thagard 1995 ; Sternberg 1997 ; Mayer 1999 ; Costello and Keane 2000 ; Dahl and Moreau 2002 ; Schunn et al . 2006 ; Green et al . 2008 ) . Reasoning by analogy is an especially effective tool for scientists trying to identify new solutions for unexpected issues that arise in their research ( Dunbar and Blanchette 2001 ) . Analogies that bridge great semantic distances , as when Bohr envisioned the atom as a tiny solar system , have proven uniquely powerful for catalyzing innovative leaps ofscientiﬁcadvancement ( HolyoakandThagard 1995 ; Dunbar and Blanchette 2001 ) . In consumer marketing , product development strategies based on analogical reasoning lead to products that are more innovative , more useful , and bring a higher price from consumers ( Dahl and Moreau 2002 ) . Semantic distance in analogical reasoning has also been linked to creativity ( Holyoak and Thagard 1995 ; Boden 2003 ) , and the solution of semantically distant analogies likely involves some of the same processes that underlie creative thinking ( e . g . , Green , Fugelsang , and Dunbar 2006 ; Green , Fugelsang , Kraemer , et al . 2006 ) . However , despite the importance of semantically distant analogical reasoning , brain - imaging studies have not examined the parameter of semantic distance . A key question concerns the neural substrates that support integration of semantically distant concepts in the service of analogical mapping . Here , we undertook a ﬁrst neuroimaging study of semantic distance in analogical reasoning . We restricted our focus to analogical reasoning not only because it is widely considered important for supporting innovation but also because it is a con - strained and well - characterized reasoning process ( Sternberg 1977 , 1997 ; Holyoak and Thagard 1995 ; Gentner et al . 1997 ; Costello and Keane 2000 ; Green , Fugelsang , and Dunbar 2006 ; Green et al . 2008 ) . Brain - imaging studies have implicated the frontal pole of the brain in the most complex components of analogical reasoning ( Bunge et al . 2005 ; Geake and Hansen 2005 ; Green , Fugelsang , Kraemer , et al . 2006 ; Wendelken et al . 2008 ) . In particular , a circumscribed region within left frontopolar cortex is speciﬁcally involved in the mapping component of analogical reasoning ( Green , Fugelsang , Kraemer , et al . 2006 ) . A rich cognitive literature has identiﬁed mapping as the compo - nent of analogical reasoning that most directly involves bridging semantic distance ( Holyoak and Thagard 1995 ; Barnett and Ceci 2002 ; Bowdle and Gentner 2005 ) . This is because mapping is the component of analogy in which nonobvious but informative similarities are represented in order to form connections between seemingly disparate concepts . The evidence that frontopolar cortex plays a key role in analogical mapping ( Bunge et al . 2005 ; Geake and Hansen 2005 ; Green , Fugelsang , Kraemer , et al . 2006 ) , and that analogical mapping is critical for integrating semantically distant repre - sentations ( Sternberg 1977 ; Holyoak and Thagard 1995 ; Costello and Keane 2000 ) , suggests the novel hypothesis that frontopolar cortex supports the neural integration of (cid:1) The Author 2009 .

Here , we tested and found support for this hypothesis within an a priori predicted region of interest ( ROI ) in frontopolar cortex . In 4 - word analogy stimuli of the form‘‘A is to B as C is to D , ’’we parametrically varied semantic distance values , as derived quantitatively from latent semantic analysis ( Landauerand Dumais 1997 ; Landaueretal . 1998 ) . Thatis , we varied the semantic distance from [ A : B ] to [ C : D ] , over which the2 halves of the analogy had to be integratedthrough analogical mapping . Parametric analyses revealed that semantic distance predicted activity in the frontopolar ROI during analogical reasoning , even after statistically removing the effect of task difﬁculty . Our ﬁndings , thus , provide a ﬁrst brain - based character - ization of semantic distance in analogical reasoning , identifying increasing frontopolar recruitment as a key mechanism . Materials and Methods Subjects Twenty - three right - handed native English speakers ( 12 male , M = 22 . 2 years ) were recruited from the local college community to participate in the functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) study . Informed written consent for all participants was obtained prior to the experiment in accordance with the guidelines established by the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at Dartmouth College . Eighty - four undergraduate native English speakers ( 18 male , M = 21 . 8 years ) participated in the stimuli rating . Informed written consent for all participants was obtained prior to the experiment in accordance with the guidelines established by the Human Research Ethics Committee at the University of Waterloo . Stimuli and Procedure Participants performed 120 analogy trials ( see Fig . 1 and Supplementary Table S1 ) during 4 - event - related fMRI runs . On each trial , participants indicated whether a 4 - word set constituted a valid analogy ( left word pair analogous to right word pair ) , responding ‘‘true’’ or ‘‘false’’ by button press with the index or middle ﬁnger of the right hand . The experimenter instructed that ‘‘You will have up to 8 s to respond . ’’ Accuracy is more important than speed so try to respond as accurately as possible . ’’ Visuospatial properties were consistent across stimuli ; all stimuli were sets of exactly 4 words presented such that a 15 cm by 6 cm rectangle was formed by the midpoints of the 4 words subtending 7 . 5 (cid:2) of visual angle . The semantic distance value for each analogy item was obtained using latent semantic analysis ( Landauer and Dumais 1997 ; Landauer et al . 1998 ) . In particular , pairwise comparisons were made between the word pairs constituting the left and right halves of each analogy . The latent semantic analysis application ( http : / / lsa . colorado . edu ) calculates the similarity between the contextual - usage meanings of words as measured by the cosine of the included angle between vectors assigned to those words within a very high - dimensional ‘‘semantic space , ’’ comprising extensive corpa of English text . A vector is added for multiword inputs such as the word pairs constituting our analogy stimuli . Semantic distance values were used in the main parametric analysis . Speciﬁcally , these values allowed us to identify regions of the brain where semantic distance correlated with stimulus - related activity in a parametric relationship . In addition , 84 independent raters used a 7 - point scale to score all analogy stimuli for difﬁculty ( ‘‘How difﬁcult is it to identify the analogical connection ? ’’ ) . We used these ratings as a parametric regressor for subsequent fMRI analysis . Semantic distance values were correlated with rated difﬁculty ( r = 0 . 43 , P = < 0 . 001 ) . Wealsoobtainedabinaryratingforallstimuliinordertoseparatethem into2classes : cross - domainanalogies ( involvingmapping between items taken from disparate semantic domains ) , and within - domain analogies ( involving mapping between items taken from proximal semantic domains ; examples in Fig . 1 ; see Green et al . 2008 for discussion of the within - domain vs . cross - domain distinction in analogy ) . All stimuli were established as within - domain or cross - domain at a level of > 90 % agreement among the group of 84 independent raters ( ‘‘Are the items intheleftwordpairtakenfromthesamesemanticdomainastheitemsintherightwordpair ? That is , do the 2 word pairs involve similar kinds of thingsordifferentkindsofthings’’ ) . Equalnumbersofwithin - domainand cross - domain analogy stimuli were used . This was done to test the predictionthatfrontopolarcortexwouldreﬂectaproposedtaxonomyintheanalogyliteratureinwhichanalogicalreasoningiscentrallydividedbasedonthewithin - domain versus cross - domain distinction ( Holyoak and Thagard 1995 ; Barnett and Ceci 2002 ; Bowdle and Gentner 2005 ) . Stimuli were also established as true or false at > 90 % agreement . False analogies were included as a manipulation check ( half within - domain , halfcross - domain ) . Inordertoreducestimulus - speciﬁcconfounding , the same ‘‘base’’ word pair ( e . g . , [ Nose : Scent ] ) was used on the left side in 1 trial of each stimulus type . All words were singular nouns and were equated for mean word length , number of syllables , word frequency , and concretenessforwithin - domainandcross - domainstimuli , usingtheMRC Psycholinguistic Database ( Wilson 1988 ) . The complete set of stimuli was broken into subsets of 3 stimuli that shared the same left word - pair ( 1 cross - domain analogy , 1 within - domain analogy , and 1 false analogy ; see Fig . 1 ) . Trial order was pseudorandomized with the constraint that no consecutive trials shared the same left word pair ( no consecutive presentations from the same 3 - stimuli subset ) . Order was also counterbalanced such that , for example , the cross - domain analogy was equally likely to be the ﬁrst , second , or third trial presented from its 3 - stimuli subset . fMRI Data Acquisition and Analysis Data were collected on a 1 . 5 - T whole body scanner ( General Electric Medical Systems Signa , Milwaukee , WI ) . For each subject , data were preprocessed , realigned , coregistered , normalized , and spatially smoothed ( 6 mm full width at half maximum ) . Functional imaging data were analyzed using the general linear model in SPM99 ( Friston et al . 1995 ) , including a mixed blocked / event - related design to separate variance associated with the analogy task of interest in the present investigation from another analogy task and covariates of no interest ( session mean , linear trend , and 6 movement parameters derived from realignment corrections ) . Contrast images were generated for each subject via a voxelwise t - contrast analysis for comparisons between each pair of conditions and between each condition and ﬁxation baseline . These individual contrast images were then submitted to a second - level , random - effects analysis to create group mean t images ( thresholded at P = 0 . 001 uncorrected , including only clusters larger than 30 voxels ) . Following calculation of these group - level contrasts , a small - volume correction ( SVC ; a = 0 . 05 SVC corrected ) within an a priori predicted ROI in frontopolar cortex was applied to a group - level statistical map of the cross - domain > within - domain contrast . In the main parametric analysis , the semantic distance value ( equal to 1 minus the pairwise term - to - term similarity value ) for each of the analogies were entered as a parametric regressor into a design matrix for each subject in order to test whether these values were predictive of brain activity within the a priori predicted frontopolar ROI . A general linear model incorporating task effects , a parametric regressor ( in - dicating the semantic distance value of each analogy item ) , and covariates of no interest was used to compute parameter estimates ( b ) and t - contrast images for each comparison at each voxel and for each subject . In this way , the height of the expected hemodynamic response function was parametrically adjusted for all analogy events as a function of the semantic distance value of each analogy . These results were then brought to a second - level random - effects group analysis . Results of the parametric analysis were thresholded at P < 0 . 0001 uncorrected ( voxel extent = 20 ) , and then an SVC was applied within the frontopolar ROI Figure 1 . Example stimuli . The ﬁgure displays examples of the 3 classes of trials presented to participants during fMRI . The same word pair appeared on the left side in 1 trial of each class .

Additionally , several similar parametric analyses , thresholded at a less conservative threshold ( P < 0 . 01 uncorrected ) , were performed in which response times , mean percent correct , and rated difﬁculty for each analogy item were taken as regressors to determine whether factors related to difﬁculty were signiﬁcant modulators of activity in frontopolar cortex . Results Behavioral Findings Participants performed at a response accuracy level of 92 . 97 % ± standard deviation ( SD ) = 4 . 62 % , standard error ( SE ) = 0 . 42 % overall , 92 . 52 % ± SD = 4 . 21 % , SE = 0 . 47 % for true trials , and 93 . 91 % ± SD = 5 . 38 % , SE = 0 . 85 % for false trials . Item analysis revealed that response accuracy and semantic distance values were not correlated ( r = – 0 . 18 , P = 0 . 11 ) . Participants performed with a mean response time of 4780 ± SD = 503 , SE = 54 ms overall , 4493 ± SD = 430 , SE = 51 ms for true trials , and 5354 ± SD = 591 , SE = 93 ms for false trials . Response time was positively correlated with semantic distance ( r = 0 . 36 , P = 0 . 001 ) . fMRI Findings Frontopolar recruitment strengthened as a function of in - creasing semantic distance of analogical mapping ( see Fig . 2 ) . In order to probe the relationship between semantic distance and frontopolar activity , semantic distance values for each analogy stimulus item were entered into the design matrix as a parametric regressor . We tested whether these values were predictive of neural activity in an a priori ROI constituting a sphere ( radius 10 mm ) , centered at a functional peak in left frontopolar cortex that we have previously implicated in the mapping component of analogical reasoning ( Green , Fugelsang , Kraemer , et al . 2006 ; Talairach coordinates : x = – 8 , y = 60 , and z = 26 ) . An SVC demonstrated that semantic distance positively modulated activity within this ROI ( t = 6 . 46 , P < 0 . 05 SVC corrected ; see Fig . 2 ) . Table 1 displays the results of the main parametric semantic distance analysis over the whole brain at the exploratory threshold of P < 0 . 0001 uncorrected . To dissociate the effect of semantic distance from difﬁculty , we regressed response time , correctness , and rated difﬁculty against semantic distance for our stimuli . We then used the set of residual variances from this multiple regression ( i . e . , values representing semantic distance with difﬁculty partialed out ) as a parametric regressor in SPM . Conﬁrming our main parametric analysis while controlling for possible confounds , these residuals were predictive of blood oxygen level - - dependent signal in the frontopolar ROI ( t = 5 . 07 , P < 0 . 05 SVC corrected ) , strongly suggesting that difﬁculty - related factors cannot explain the relation between semantic distance and frontopolar activity . Activity in anterior cingulate , caudate head , and inferior occipital gyrus was not signiﬁcantly modulated by semantic distance after difﬁculty - related factors were partialed out . As an additional examination of semantic distance in analogical mapping , we tested the neural bases of a central distinction in the analogical reasoning literature between 2 types of analogies ( Barnett and Ceci 2002 ; Bowdle and Gentner 2005 ; Green , Fugelsang , and Dunbar 2006 ; Green et al . 2008 ) . Analogies were classiﬁed as either cross - domain or within - domain by indepen - dent rating . A direct comparison revealed that cross - domain analogies were associated with signiﬁcantly greater recruitment of the frontopolar ROI than within - domain analogies ( t = 3 . 52 , P < 0 . 05 SVC corrected ) . This contrast corroborates the main parametric analysis because cross - domain analogies had signiﬁcantly higher semantic distance values than within - domain analogies , t ( 118 ) = 11 . 6 , P < 0 . 001 ) . However , the parametric relationship between semantic distance and frontopolar activity was signiﬁcant even whenrestrictingparametricanalysisto only cross - domainanalogy trials or only within - domain trials . That is , separate analyses for within - domainand cross - domainanalogiesrevealedthatsemantic distance was a signiﬁcant positive modulator of activity in the frontopolar ROI ( P < 0 . 05 SVC corrected ) for both classes of analogy . Also corroborating the main parametric analysis , separate analyses indicated that semantic distance positively modulated activity in the frontopolar ROI for both true ( t = 6 . 82 , P < 0 . 05 SVC corrected ) and false ( t = 4 . 93 , P < 0 . 05 SVC corrected ) trials . A direct contrast revealed that frontopolar activity was greater for true trials than false trials at a marginally signiﬁcant level ( t = 3 . 14 , P < 0 . 06 SVC corrected ) , putatively because analogical mapping on true trials involved a greater relational integration component ( see Green , Fugelsang , Kraemer , et al . 2006 for a discussion of this issue ) . To further assess possible confounds between semantic distance and difﬁculty , each participant’s response times for Figure 2 . Neural response to semantic distance in reasoning .

These results were then brought to the group level prior to computation of the group - level semantic distance parametric analysis . An exclu - sionary mask derived from the response time parametric analysis at a nonconservative threshold of P < 0 . 01 uncorrected and applied to the semantic distance parametric analysis revealed that response time did not modulate activity in any voxel within the frontopolar ROI . This analysis indicates that preferential recruitment of frontopolar cortex for more semantically distant analogies is not due to greater response time . Similarly , structured parametric analyses based on rated difﬁculty , and mean percentage correct for each analogy item also revealed no signiﬁcantly modulated voxels with the frontopolar ROI . Discussion The present ﬁndings provide a ﬁrst empirical characterization of how the brain mediates semantically distant analogical mapping . Our data implicate a direct relationship between semantic distance of analogical mapping and commensurate recruitment of frontopolar cortex . In particular , parametric analyses revealed that semantic distance values of analogy stimuli were signiﬁ - cantly predictive of activity within an a priori frontopolar region previously implicated in analogical mapping ( Green , Fugelsang , Kraemer , et al . 2006 ) . Critically , semantic distance of analogical mapping , and not task difﬁculty ( as assayed by response time , correctness , and rated difﬁculty ) , modulated activity within this frontopolar ROI . Relational Integration and Broader Functionality of Frontopolar Cortex Our ﬁndings support a general rostrocaudal hierarchy of PFC organization , which is empirically indicated by a growing body of research ( Christoff and Gabrieli 2000 ; Braver and Bongiolatti 2002 ; Bunge et al . 2003 ; Koechlin et al . 2003 ; Badre and D’Esposito 2007 ) . One account , which is broadly consistent with the present ﬁndings , holds that information is derived from external stimuli ( e . g . , 4 - word sets ) at relatively caudal areas of supramodal cortex , and internal representations generated from this information are integrated through more abstract cognitive operations ( e . g . , analogical mapping ) medi - ated by frontopolar cortex ( also called rostral prefrontal cortex ; Christoff and Gabrieli 2000 ; Gilbert , Spengler , Simons , Steele , et al . 2006 ; Burgess et al . 2009 ) . Interpretation of the present ﬁndings is most directly informed by a cognitive - anatomical architecture of prefrontal cortex proposed by Ramnani and Owen ( 2004 ) . This architec - ture uniﬁes a range of evidence concerning frontopolar cortex , considering functional brain - imaging ﬁndings in the context of the histological properties and connectivity of this region . The authors note that the extent of arborization of neurons in frontopolarcortex ( numberofdendriticspinespercellandspine density ) is greater than in comparable areas of frontal cortex , whereas the density of cell bodies is substantially less . They suggestthatthisstructureindicates anintegrative mechanism . In particular , one of the major integrative functions ascribed to frontopolar cortex is integration of relations for reasoning ( Christoff et al . 2001 ; Ramnani and Owen 2004 ; Waltz et al . 2004 ) , whichisthecognitiveoperationinstantiatedbyanalogical mapping ( e . g . , Gilbert , Spengler , Simons , Steele , et al . 2006 ) . The present ﬁndings build on this architecture and on our previous work implicating frontopolar cortex in relational integration during analogical reasoning and other complex cognition . Speciﬁcally , the data newly demonstrate that the relational integration mechanism of frontopolar cortex is sensitive to the semantic distance across which representations must be integrated . As such , our ﬁndings implicate degree of frontopolar activation as a marker of semantic distance in analogical reasoning . Increasing cortical activity may reﬂect increasing computational demand placed on the neuronal integration network of frontopolar cortex commensurate with relational integration across increasing semantic distance . Prior studies have reported frontopolar activation elicited by nonverbal reasoning tasks . These studies have employed object matrices and strings of alpha - numeric characters of varying complexity ( Christoff et al . 2001 ; Kroger et al . 2002 ; Raven et al . 2003 ; Geake and Hansen 2005 ; Smith et al . 2007 ) . Activity reportedinthese nonverbal paradigmshave variedsomewhat , but has consistently involved bilateral foci . By contrast , the present study found unilateral left - sided activation associated with our verbal reasoning task . This ﬁnding is consistent with prior reports of left - lateralized frontopolar activity associated with verbal analogical reasoning ( Bunge et al . 2005 ; Gilbert , Spengler , Simons , Steele , et al . 2006 ) . Moreover , foci reported in studies of nonverbal reasoning have typically been caudal to the ROI investigated in the present study , which was initially identiﬁed in our previous study of verbal analogy ( Gilbert , Spengler , Simons , Steele , et al . 2006 ) . These differences may reﬂect a distinction between semantic distance and the relational complexity variable ( number of terms to be integrated in relational reasoning ; Halford et al . 1998 ) , which was manipulated in prior nonverbal stimuli , or they may reﬂect the more general verbal versus nonverbal modality distinction . The extent to which prior , nonverbal paradigms may have varied a form of semantic distance is not clear , although this possibility seems at least plausible given the stimuli employed inthose paradigms ( Christoffet al . 2001 ; Kroger et al . 2002 ; Geake and Hansen 2005 ) . In any circumstance , the present data do not indicate against relational complexity as a modulator of frontopolar activity , especially for nonverbal reasoning . Indeed , it is likely that an umbrella term , such as relational ﬂexibility , which includes relating / integrating terms across semantic distance , as well as processing relational complexity , might provide a more com - plete sense of the range of cognitive demands that modulate activity in frontopolar cortex . This view is consistent with the adaptive coding model of prefrontal cortex proposed by Duncan Table 1 Whole - brain parametric analysis of semantic distance Anatomical region Brodmannarea t Talairach coordinates Cluster size , voxels ( n ) x y z Left superior frontal gyrus ( frontopolar ) 9 / 10 6 . 46 a (cid:1) 12 58 26 33 Left anterior cingulate gyrus 32 6 . 32 (cid:1) 5 29 24 57 Left STG 22 6 . 85 (cid:1) 45 26 (cid:1) 1 53 Right STG 22 6 . 36 36 26 (cid:1) 6 21 Left IFG 45 7 . 05 (cid:1) 52 19 16 33 Left caudate head 8 6 . 25 (cid:1) 12 15 0 24 Right inferior occipital gyrus 18 8 . 02 37 (cid:1) 83 (cid:1) 5 20 Note : All results thresholded at P \ 0 . 0001 uncorrected ( voxel extent 5 20 ) . a Signiﬁcant after SVC ( a 5 0 . 05 ) within a priori frontopolar ROI .

In particular , the statistical , rather than absolute , regional speciﬁcity of prefrontal cortex delineated in this model may help to explain why reported frontopolar loci have been nearby each other , but not preciselycolocalized , forsimilarbutnonidenticalreasoningtasks ( Christoff et al . 2001 ; Kroger et al . 2002 ; Gilbert , Spengler , Simons , Steele , et al . 2006 ; Wendelken et al . 2008 ) . Cross - Domain Analogies versus within - Domain Analogies The ﬁnding that cross - domain analogies elicited stronger frontopolar recruitment than within - domain analogies addresses a central question in the analogy literature concerning whether and how the within - domain versus cross - domain distinction is reﬂected at the neural level ( Barnett and Ceci 2002 ; Bowdle and Gentner 2005 ; Green , Fugelsang , and Dunbar 2006 , 2008 ) . The differential recruitment of left frontopolar cortex identiﬁed in the present study provides the ﬁrst brain - based support for a proposed taxonomy of analogical reasoning , in which the within - domain versus cross - domain distinction is the primary structural division ( Barnett and Ceci 2002 ) . The data indicate that frontopolar cortex is recruited more strongly for the mapping of cross - domain analogies than within - domain analo - gies ( Barnett and Ceci 2002 ; Bowdle and Gentner 2005 ; Green , Fugelsang , and Dunbar 2006 ; Green et al . 2008 ) . At a ﬁner grain , separate parametric analyses for within - domain and cross - domain analogies revealed that the parame - ter of semantic distance positively modulated frontopolar activation for analogies in both classes ( P < 0 . 05 SVC corrected for both analyses ) . Thus , the correlation between frontopolar recruitment and semantic distance was not simply due to the cross - domain versus within - domain distinction . Although fron - topolar activity broadly reﬂects a taxonomic distinction between these classes of analogy , the mechanism of frontopo - lar recruitment appears to operate at a level of sensitivity that is more ﬁne grained than a single gross dichotomy . Dissociating Semantic Distance from Difﬁculty The present data indicate that semantic distance is dissociable from task difﬁculty at the neural level . Parametric analyses of responsetime , accuracy , andrateddifﬁcultyrevealednoactivityin the targeted frontopolar ROI due to these variables . Moreover , even after these measures of task difﬁculty were partialed out of our results , semanticdistancestill covariedpositively withactivity in the frontopolar ROI . These ﬁndings strongly suggest that difﬁculty - related factors cannot explain the relation between semantic distance and frontopolar activity . These results are consistent with previous work , indicating that speciﬁc task demands of complex reasoning , rather than time - on - task or difﬁculty per se , account for frontopolar recruitment ( Christoff et al . 2001 ; Geake and Hansen 2005 ) . In addition , stimuli in the present study were equated for visuospatial properties and word length ( see Materials and Methods section ) , so visuospatial complexity does not account for the observed modulation of frontopolar cortex . ROI - Based Hypothesis Testing One of the challenges of studying the neural bases of high - level cognitive function is the difﬁculty of constraining predictions and replicating / colocalizing brain regions across different studies . As noted above , even within the set of investigations reporting frontopolar recruitment associated with relational reasoning , loci of activation have varied ( Christoff and Gabrieli 2000 ; Braver and Bongiolatti 2002 ; Bunge et al . 2003 , 2005 ; Koechlin et al . 2003 ; Gilbert Spengler , Simons , Frith , and Burgess 2006 ; Burgess et al . 2009 ) . Each of these ﬁndings has contributed to a better understanding of the functions of this brain region . Nonetheless , the extent to which the cognitive operations associated with different reported loci are over - lapping or distinct is still largely unresolved ( Gilbert , Spengler , Simons , Steele , et al . 2006 ) . Here , we directly tied the present work to our previous ﬁndings ( Green , Fugelsang , Kraemer , et al . 2006 ) by making a targeted prediction constrained by a previously reported peak of functional activation in fronto - polar cortex . As such , the present research provides support for the practicability of ROI - based hypothesis testing in studies of high - level cognition . Beyond Frontopolar Cortex Although our central hypothesis concerned activation in the targeted frontopolar region that we previously implicated in analogical mapping , our parametric analysis of semantic distance revealed several additional activating regions ( Table 1 ) . It is possible that these regions directly or indirectly contribute to the neural processing of semantically distant analogies . The observed activity in bilateral superior temporal gyrus ( STG ) , for example , is consistent with prior studies of verbal problem solving and integrating novel semantic relations during language comprehension ( Bottini et al . 1994 ; St George et al . 1999 ; Bekhtereva et al . 2000 ; Jung - Beeman et al . 2004 ) . Bilateral STG is preferentially recruited for comprehending ( by reading or listening ) sentences or stories , relative to comprehending single words ( Mazoyer et al . 1993 ; Bottini et al . 1994 ; Stowe et al . 1999 ; Humphries et al . 2001 ) . STG activity has also been associated with integrating across sentences to extract themes ( St George et al . 1999 ) , and is elevated for solving word problems when the solutions involve an ‘‘aha’’ moment of insight ( Jung - Beeman et al . 2004 ) . STG activity in this study may also be relevant to the putative association of semantically distant analogical reasoning with creativity ( Holyoak and Thagard 1995 ; Boden 2003 ) . Samco et al . ( 2005 ) found that fractional anisotropy ( a measure of ﬁber tract organization obtained from diffusion tensor imaging ) of white matter connections between frontal and superior temporal cortex correlated with performance on a behavioral measure of verbal and ﬁgural creativity . The activity we observed in left - sided inferior frontal gyrus ( IFG ) may also reﬂect increasing semantic distance of analogical reasoning , putatively as a result of greater semantic elaboration ( Wagner et al . 1998 ; Wig et al . 2004 ) , and increasing selection demand ( Thompson - Schill et al . 1997 ; Badre et al . 2005 ) . Previous analogy research has suggested that , because cross - domain analogies require the reasoner to formulate abstract connections between systems that do not have obvious similarities , cross - domain analogies elicit greater semantic elaboration than within - domain analogies ( Chen 1999 ; Blanch - ette and Dunbar 2002 ; Didierjean and Nogry 2004 ) . Semantic elaboration is an established strategy for enhancing learning and remembering ( Wagner et al . 1998 ; Davachi et al . 2001 ) , and likely contributes to the effectiveness of analogy as a teaching tool ( Donnelly and McDaniel 1993 ) . Brain - based memory research 74 Semantic Distance in Analogy d Green et al . a t U n i v e r s i t y o f W a t e r l oo on M a r c h 11 , 2010 h tt p : / / c e r c o r . o x f o r d j ou r na l s . o r g D o w n l oaded f r o m has implicated left IFG as centrally involved in semantic elaboration ( Kapur et al . 1994 ; Wagner et al . 1998 ; Wig et al . 2004 ) . The present ﬁnding that IFG was preferentially recruited for more semantically distant analogies is consistent with this literature . The IFG ﬁnding in the present study also accords with a growing literature concerning the role of IFG in selecting among semantic representations . IFG ( speciﬁcally dorsal BA 44 / 45 ) is reliably associated with tasks that require choosing among words or objects along some semantic dimension ( e . g . , color , size , expense , and similarity ) . Across studies , IFG has been preferentially recruited for higher versus lower selection de - mand conditions , indicating that increasing activity in IFG supports a task - general selection process ( i . e . , identifying the correct alternative amid ambiguity or competition ; Thompson - Schillet al . 1997 , 1998 ) . Based onthis literature , we mightexpect greater IFG activity for more semantically distant analogies if the valid analogical mapping is more ambiguous ( e . g . , more selection demand in identifying the correct mapping among possible alternatives that participants mentally generate in evaluating whether 4 - word sets constitute valid analogies ) . Indeed , this is whatweobservedinIFGasparticipants arrivedattheirtrue / false judgments about the presented 4 - word sets . For the reasons noted here , it is not surprising to ﬁnd that IFG activity tracks with semantic in our stimuli . Nonetheless , the literatures concerning frontopolar cortex and IFG indicate that these regions likely serve different functions , with fronto - polar cortex being more involved in relational integration across semantic distance , and IFG being more involved in semantic elaboration and selection processes . Both the IFG andSTG ﬁndings inthe present studyunderscore the importance of taking a network approach to studying the neural basis of analogical reasoning and other high - level cognitive constructs . The present study focused on a targeted regionoffrontopolarcortexbecausewesought totestanapriori anatomical hypothesis . However , it is a virtual certainty that multiple brain regions contribute cooperatively to semantically distant analogical reasoning , and STG and IFG appear to be likely contributors . Some oftheobserved activationsmayreﬂectparameters other thansemanticdistance . Occipitalactivity , forexample , islikelyto reﬂect longer looking times for more semantically distant analogies . When response time was partialed out from semantic distance , thisactivitynolongersurpassedtheexploratorywhole - brain threshold of P < 0 . 0001 . Anterior cingulate activity is likely a reﬂection of increasing response conﬂict ( i . e . , whether to respond true or false ) on more semantically distant analogy trials ( Barch et al . 2000 ; MacDonald et al . 2000 ; Braver et al . 2001 ; Botvinick et al . 2004 ) . This activity also failed to reach the whole - brain exploratory threshold after partialing out difﬁculty - related factors from semantic distance . Conclusions The present investigation demonstrates a novel paradigm in reasoning research and offers some new clarity in the neuroscience of cognition that supports innovation . This paradigm leverages a well - characterized form of reasoning ( i . e . , analogical reasoning ) , parametrically varies a quantiﬁable factor identiﬁed as important for innovative outcomes ( i . e . , semantic distance ) , and targets a constrained a priori brain region ( i . e . , frontopolar cortex ) . Our data implicate increasing frontopolar recruitment as a neural mechanism for integrating relations across semantic distance in analogical mapping . This ﬁnding indicates a role for frontopolar cortex in supporting analogical connections that lead to innovative outcomes ( Holyoak and Thagard 1995 ; Mayer 1999 ) .
