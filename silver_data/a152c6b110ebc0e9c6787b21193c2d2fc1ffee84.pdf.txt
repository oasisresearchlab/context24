Machine Learning practices and infrastructures Glen Berman glen . berman @ anu . edu . au Australian National University Canberra , ACT , Australia ABSTRACT Machine Learning ( ML ) systems , particularly when deployed in high - stakes domains , are deeply consequential . They can exacer - bate existing inequities , create new modes of discrimination , and reify outdated social constructs . Accordingly , the social context ( i . e . organisations , teams , cultures ) in which ML systems are developed is a site of active research for the field of AI ethics , and interven - tion for policymakers . This paper focuses on one aspect of social context that is often overlooked : interactions between practitioners and the tools they rely on , and the role these interactions play in shaping ML practices and the development of ML systems . In par - ticular , through an empirical study of questions asked on the Stack Exchange forums , the use of interactive computing platforms ( e . g . Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab ) in ML practices is explored . I find that interactive computing platforms are used in a host of learn - ing and coordination practices , which constitutes an infrastructural relationship between interactive computing platforms and ML prac - titioners . I describe how ML practices are co - evolving alongside the development of interactive computing platforms , and highlight how this risks making invisible aspects of the ML life cycle that AI ethics researchers’ have demonstrated to be particularly salient for the societal impact of deployed ML systems .

XXXXXXX 1 INTRODUCTION It follows from the notion that Machine Learning ( ML ) systems ought to be thought of as sociotechnical systems [ 122 ] —i . e . systems that are socially constructed , requiring both human actors and ma - chines to work [ 36 ] —that the social context in which an ML system Permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page .

XXXXXXX is researched , developed , and deployed is likely to shape the char - acteristics of that system . Given the increasing rate of ML system deployment in high - stakes domains , and widespread evidence of ML systems failing to meet societal expectations [ e . g . 25 , 69 , 94 , 123 ] , a key question for the ML field relates to infrastructuralisation and its implications for ML practices and deployed ML systems . This paper begins to address this question by attending to one aspect of social context—interactions between ML practitioners and the tools they use to research , build , and deploy ML systems—and demon - strating the relevance of this context to concerns raised by AI ethics researchers . The social context of ML system development has been studied in the emerging AI ethics field [ e . g . 15 , 33 , 55 , 80 ] . However , relatively little attention has been paid to tracing the relationship between specific material features of this context and the characteristics of ML systems that are developed [ 72 ] . That is , the role of mate - rial things ( e . g . software tools , office layouts , computer interfaces , network connections ) , which themselves are socially constructed , alongside social things ( e . g . people , beliefs , norms ) in shaping ML systems merits closer scrutiny . In this paper , I consider one aspect of this sociomaterial context of ML system development : the use of interactive computing platforms ( e . g . Jupyter Notebooks and Google Colaboratory ) during ML model development and evalu - ation . I explore the structure of these platforms and their use by ML practitioners , and consider the ways in which this use may contribute to conventions of ML practices . This exploration serves to illustrate the importance for the AI ethics field of attending both to the sociomaterial context of ML system development generally , and to the role of interactive computing platforms , in particular . The research question to which this exploration is addressed is : how are interactive computing platforms used in ML practices ? To answer this question I developed a probabilistic topic model of user - contributed questions on the Stack Exchange forums re - lated to ML and the use of interactive computing platforms . Stack Exchange forums were selected due to their wide use by data and computer scientists , software engineers , and technologists gener - ally [ 6 , 10 ] . Alongside this I undertook qualitative text analysis of a small sample of Stack Exchange questions . I find that interactive computing platforms are used in a range of ML practices , particu - larly in the data curation and processing , and model training and evaluation stages of ML system development . I highlight the role of interactive computing platforms in learning practices , and in practices of coordination across multiple infrastructures . To inter - pret these findings I draw on sociological studies of infrastructures and practices , particularly the work of sociologists Susan Leigh Star [ 20 , 129 – 131 ] and Elizabeth Shove [ 124 , 125 , 145 ] , and cultural anthropologist Brian Larkin [ 73 , 74 ] . I conclude that learning and coordination roles are indicative of an infrastructural relationship between ML practitioners and interactive computing platforms , a r X i v : 2307 . 06518v2 [ c s .

As such , this paper contributes an empirical snapshot of the use of interactive computing platforms in ML practices , and argues for a renewed focus in the field of AI ethics on the emergence of digital platform infrastructures in the ML ecosystem . 2 RELATED WORK 2 . 1 The sociomaterial context of Machine Learning practices As ML systems have become objects of sociological interest [ e . g . 26 , 35 , 67 , 83 ] , the social context in which ML systems are re - searched , developed , commissioned , and deployed has garnered increased attention in diverse fields from Human - Computer Inter - action [ 54 , 84 ] , to Science and Technology Studies [ 28 ] , to public policy [ 71 ] . In this paper , I refer to sociomaterial context rather than social context to signal a particular focus on the intertwining of socially - constructed material things—specifically , interactive com - puting platforms—in ML practices . As Paul Leonardi et al . [ 76 – 78 ] have argued , a sociomaterial perspective highlights how the ma - terial is socially constructed , and the social is enacted through ma - terial forms . A sociomaterial perspective invites us to consider the material things that ML practitioners enrol in their day - to - day work , alongside other aspects of the social context , and the contribution of these things to the stablisation of ML practices . In this context , ma - terial refers to the “properties of a technological artifact that do not change , by themselves , across differences in time and context” [ 78 , p . 7 ] —for interactive computing platforms , and software generally , this includes their user interfaces and layouts , their core capabili - ties , and their dependencies [ 110 ] . My understanding of practices is informed by social practice theory [ 18 , 116 , 128 ] , which conceptu - alises practices as routinised ways of understanding and performing social activities [ 58 ] , and highlights that multiple practices can co - exist within the same cultural setting [ 116 , p . 646 ] . Machine Learning practices are thus the constitutive matter of ‘doing’ ML . Some prac - tices ( e . g . Agile meeting processes ) may be widely shared across cultures and organisations , and others ( e . g . the use of specific soft - ware ) may vary dramatically from practitioner to practitioner . In the field of AI ethics , a sociomaterial perspective has been used to highlight the challenges of translating AI ethics research into ML practices . Michael Veale and Reuben Binns [ 140 ] , for instance , studied how statistical measures of fairness can be implemented within the practical constraints of limited access to data on pro - tected characteristics , finding that new institutional arrangements will be necessary to support industry implementation of statistical measures of fairness that depend on access to sensitive data [ cf . 16 , 17 ] . Veale and Binns argue for future empirical research on the “messy , contextually - embedded and necessarily sociotechni - cal” challenge of building ‘fairer’ ML systems [ 140 , p . 13 ] . Veale et al . [ 141 ] subsequently conducted an empirical study of ML practi - tioners in public sector organisations and their engagement with ethics issues during ML system development for high - stakes deci - sion making , finding that while practitioners have a high degree of awareness regarding ethical issues , they lack the necessary tools and organisational support to use this awareness in their ML prac - tices . Mona Sloane and Janina Zakrzewski [ 128 ] , who also situate their work within social practice theory , provide a more expanded overview of AI ethics practices , through an empirical study of the operationalisation of ethics in German AI startups . Sloane and Za - krzewski develop an anatomy of AI ethics practices , which they suggest can be used as a framework to inform improvements to ML system development practices . Relevantly , the anatomy includes ‘ethics materials’ , defined as “concrete objects , processes , roles , tools or infrastructures focused on ‘AI ethics”’ [ 128 , p . 5 ] . Holstein et al . [ 54 ] provide further support for the importance of ethics materials , through their empirical study of ML practitioners working in prod - uct teams in large technology firms to develop ‘fairer’ ML systems , which found that practitioners lack the tools needed to identify and address ethics issues that arise during ML system development . Finally , Will Orr and Jenny Davis [ 96 ] highlight how ML practices include the diffusion of responsibility for ethics during ML system development . Orr and Davis found a “pattern of ethical dispersion” amongst practitioners : practitioners perceive themselves to be the inheritors of ethical parameters from more powerful actors ( regula - tors , clients , employers ) , which their expertise translates into the characteristics of systems they develop , which are then handed over to users and clients , who assume ongoing responsibility [ 96 , p . 7 ] . These studies , along with other empirical explorations of ML prac - tice [ e . g . 55 , 64 , 71 , 108 , 119 , 139 ] and several workshops focused on the research - to - practice gap [ 9 , 12 , 133 ] , have prompted calls for better support for practitioners attempting to operationalise AI ethics principles in their ML practices [ 88 , 120 , 121 ] . This study complements and inverts these empirical studies of AI ethics in ML practices . Rather than moving from the social to the sociomaterial , this study moves from the material to the sociomaterial . That is , rather than starting with interviews [ e . g . 54 , 55 , 96 , 108 , 119 , 128 , 141 ] or surveys [ e . g . 71 , 139 ] of practition - ers to explore their understanding and operationalisation of AI ethics in ML practices , the study begins with material artefacts that practitioners use and produce in the course of their ML practices , and explores what light these artefacts may shed on the translation of AI ethics to ML practices . A similar approach is followed by Max Langenkamp and Daniel Yue [ 72 ] in their study of open source ML software use , which consists of a review of code repositories on GitHub to establish the breadth of open source use followed by interviews with practitioners to provide further context . That study takes a broad perspective , exploring trends across open source software use . In contrast , this study takes a narrow perspective , exploring how a specific category of software tool is used in ML practices . 2 . 2 Interactive computing platforms and Machine Learning practices The specific material artefacts this study starts with are interactive computing platforms ( ICPs ) , also referred to as ‘computational note - books’ [ 27 , 118 ] , ‘literate programming tools’ [ 100 ] or ‘integrated development environments’ [ 150 ] . Two widely used ICPs are the Machine Learning practices and infrastructures AIES ’23 , August , 2023 , Montreal , QC , Canada open - source Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab , Google’s exten - sion of Jupyter Notebook , designed to integrate with other Google services . 1 Figure 1 shows an example Jupyter Notebook . Figure 1 : A screenshot of a Google Colab notebook main - tained by PyTorch as part of their onboarding documenta - tion . The notebook can be accessed at : https : / / pytorch . org / tutorials / beginner / basics / buildmodel _ tutorial . html . The numbered grey cells are code cells . Immediately above each code cell is a natural language cell , which contains explanatory text . Immediately below each code cell is the output from running the cell’s code . Technically , an ICP is an interactive shell for a programming language , such as Python [ 98 ] . The shell enables users to write and interact with code fragments—called ‘cells’—alongside natural language , and to assemble series of cells into a notebook , which can be shared with others—much in the same way that a word processor enables a user to assemble an editable document and share that with others . The notebook can be thought of as a computational narrative , which enables one to read and interact with a sequence of code alongside a narrative description of what the code does [ 68 ] —hence , the terms ‘literate programming tools’ and ‘compu - tational notebooks’ . However , crucially , an ICP presents itself as only a shell : all but the most rudimentary code fragments depend on access to libraries of existing code , which a user must import into the shell environment . Similarly , particularly in the context of ML , data must be imported into the shell for the code to operate on and a compute resource must be accessed to process operations . Numerous digital infrastructures support importing code into a notebook , including the code repository GitHub , 2 in which many repositories include a notebook to demonstrate common use cases of the code [ 118 ] , PyPi , 3 which indexes and hosts Python - based code packages , and HuggingFace , 4 which indexes and hosts ML training and evaluation datasets and models . In this study , inter - active computing platform is thus preferred , as the infrastructural implications of ‘platform’ are a critical aspect of what defines these 1 Available at https : / / jupyter . org / and https : / / research . google . com / colaboratory / . 2 See https : / / github . com / . 3 See https : / / pypi . org / . 4 See https : / / huggingface . co / . tools : ICPs are highly networked arrangements , one part of a cir - cular web of infrastructures and inter - dependencies ( the Internet , cloud computing , programming languages and libraries ) . Interactive computing platforms pre - date the widespread adop - tion of ML techniques in applied settings . Indeed , their motivating design goal was to support reproducible science [ 45 , 68 , 98 ] ( see , e . g . [ 13 , 109 ] for discussions of their effectiveness at meeting this goal ) . However , as ML techniques have become ubiquitous , and data scientists have become widespread in industry , interactive computing platforms have become widely enrolled in ML practices . Commentators thus describe ICPs as the “tool of choice” for data scientists [ 99 ] , and practitioners vigorously debate the merits and drawbacks of using ICPs in applied settings [ e . g . 21 , 48 , 56 , 90 , 138 ] . Interactive computing platforms have also become objects of study in several fields adjacent to AI ethics . Human - Computer Interaction studies have developed empirical accounts of the way users interact with ICPs , focusing particularly on the role of ICPs in collaborations [ 143 , 150 ] and in data science [ 65 , 118 ] . Of particular relevance , Adam Rule et al . [ 118 ] conducted three studies of the use of ICPs by data scientists , which included a large - scale review of notebooks on GitHub and interviews with data scientists and found that ICPs tend to be used by data scientists during data exploration phases of a project , rather than for constructing and sharing detailed explanations of data analysis . Studies in the field of Software Engineering have also focused on documenting the use of ICPs , focusing particularly on ICPs as a site to study trends in code use [ 144 ] and reuse [ 70 , 100 ] , and on the their potential as educational tools [ 135 ] . Similarly , in the field of Computational Science , several studies have considered the role ICPs can play in supporting reproducible science [ 13 , 24 , 63 ] . This study provides a different perspective on ICP use , by considering ML practices in particular , and interpreting these practices through the lens of sociological studies of infrastructure , which shifts the focus of the study away from the individual user - notebook relationship and towards the broader relationship of ML practitioners to the suite of infrastructures involved in ML practices . 3 STUDYING INFRASTRUCTURES & PRACTICES Studying the relationship between practices and infrastructures can be vexed . Infrastructures may be functionally invisible to the social groups who make use of them in daily practices [ 130 ] , as I consider further in Section 6 . 2 . Further , infrastructures often span multiple practices across different social groups , which , particularly in the context of digital infrastructures , may not be geographically proxi - mate [ 19 ] . And , practices themselves are not purely infrastructural— as Shove et al . [ 126 ] argue , they bring together infrastructures and other materials , competencies , and ways of knowing . Sociological studies of infrastructures have orientated them - selves around the broad aim of rendering infrastructures , and their sociopolitical commitments , visible [ 19 ] . Ethnographic methods – historically , fieldwork and participant observation ; more recently , multi - site studies – have been used to empirically document infras - tructures [ 127 ] . Star [ 130 ] , for instance , advocates studying mo - ments of breakdown in infrastructures , seeing these as instances where infrastructures become visible to social groups . Star [ 130 ] AIES ’23 , August , 2023 , Montreal , QC , Canada Berman also observes that infrastructures are often learned as part of group membership , directing attention to moments of transience in social groups ( discussed further in Section 6 . 1 ) . However , digital infrastruc - tures present particular challenges : one cannot physically access online communities , and the number of physical sites is at least as large as the user - base of the infrastructure [ 19 ] . 5 In this study , I build on Star’s insights by focusing , as a path towards understanding ICPs and their relationship to ML practices , on moments where ML practitioners are either experiencing ICP breakdowns or limitations in their own ICP capabilities . In partic - ular , and reflecting the challenge of direct observation of digital infrastructure use , the primary data source used are the questions asked by ML practitioners on popular online forums . This is supple - mented with analysis of ICP affordances and inter - dependencies . This approach follows in the spirit of other studies of digital infras - tructure , such as Plantin et al . ’s [ 102 ] analysis of the documentation and inter - dependencies of the Figshare platform and Andre Brock’s [ 22 ] analysis of Black Twitter through analysis of Twitter interfaces and user generated content , although the study presented here is narrower in scope . 4 METHOD This study consisted of an empirical study of user - generated con - tent on the Stack Exchange forums , supported by a close reading of a small number of exemplars texts [ 61 ] . In particular , a Struc - tured Topic Model ( STM ) [ 111 – 114 ] of user - generated questions about ML and the use of interactive computing platforms on Stack Exchange forums was estimated . 6 A similar approach has been used in a number of studies of Stack Exchange forums [ 2 ] , for in - stance to identify challenges practitioners face in developing ML systems more generally [ 3 ] or themes in questions asked by mobile application developers [ 115 ] or themes in privacy - related [ 134 ] or security - related questions [ 149 ] . 7 4 . 1 Corpus development and description English - language Stack Exchange community forums , specifically Stack Overflow , Cross Validated , Data Science , Computer Science , and Software Engineering were mined for relevant questions . Stack Exchange claims to be the world’s largest programming commu - nity . 8 As of October 2022 , its most popular forum , Stack Overflow , had over 19 million registered users , who contribute , edit , and moderate questions and answers on the forum . 9 Previous research 5 Although outside the scope of this paper , an additional emerging challenge is auto - mated personalisation of digital infrastructures , which makes obtaining a general view of the infrastructure challenging [ 137 ] . ICPs do not currently afford personalisation in this way . 6 See [ 59 , 82 , 87 , 93 ] for overviews of topic modelling in the social sciences , and [ 11 , 23 ] for more critical perspectives . 7 Code to reproduce pre - processing steps and the topic model described below , are available at https : / / github . com / gberman - aus / aies _ 23 _ topic _ modelling . 8 See https : / / stackexchange . com / to access Stack Exchange and its forums . Stack Over - flow is broadly focused on computer programming . Cross Validated is a more spe - cialised forum , focused on statistics and data analysis . Software Engineering is a similarly specialised forum , focused on software systems development . Finally , Data Science and Computer Science are relatively small forums , focused on data and com - puter science respectively . However , reflecting the ubiquity of ML techniques in com - puting , questions related to ML occur in all of these forums , and , as all of these forums are user - moderated , their boundaries and scope are dynamic . 9 This estimate is based on a query of the Stack Exchange Data Dump . See [ 8 , 10 ] for studies of Stack Overflow usage . demonstrates that Stack Overflow is enmeshed in software engi - neering and data science practices [ e . g . 1 , 5 , 8 , 38 , 91 , 136 ] , and that ML techniques are a rapidly growing topic of discussion on the forum [ 3 ] . The Stack Exchange forums share data structures 10 and interface layouts , with annoymised user questions , answers , and comments from all Stack Exchange forum made available for querying and research through the Stack Exchange Data Dump [ e . g . 3 , 115 , 149 ] . 11 Questions related to ML and interactive computing platforms were extracted from the Stack Exchange forums listed above on 23 November , 2022 . Four example questions are shown in Figure 2 . To identify relevant questions the topical tags associated with every question were leveraged . Through manual review of the forums , and queries of the Stack Exchange Data Dump , 10 ICP tags and 32 ML related tags were identified . 12 These tags are listed in Appendix A . Having identified relevant ML and ICP tags , two datasets were extracted from the Stack Exchange Data Dump : all questions on the selected forums with at least one ML related tag ( a large dataset consisting of 485 , 053 questions ) , and all questions on these forum with at least one ICP related tag ( a smaller dataset of 75 , 639 questions ) . The ML tagged questions were filtered by the presence of an ICP term ( leaving 36 , 940 questions ) , and ICP tagged questions were filtered by ML terms ( leaving 9 , 634 questions ) . This procedure resulted in two datasets with some substantial overlap . After de - duplication , a final dataset of 21 , 555 ML and ICP related questions was left ; this dataset became the corpus used to estimate a STM topic model . . 13 4 . 2 Estimation of the topic model STM is a probabilistic , mixed - membership topic model , which ex - tends the widely - used Latent Dirichlet Allocation model by en - abling the inclusion of metadata—here , the tags associated with questions and question creation date—in the model training process ( see [ 82 , 114 ] for introductions to STM ) . To prepare the corpus for topic modelling , pre - processing was undertaken using the 𝑠𝑡𝑚 R package [ 112 ] ( see [ 46 , 147 ] for discussion of pre - processing proce - dures ) . Title and body fields for questions were concatenated into a single column . Questions on Stack Exchange forums are formatted using markdown , and often include large snippets of computer code . All code snippets and markdown were removed from questions . Code snippets were retained for subsequent analysis . Html sym - bols ( e . g . ‘ & quot ; ’ ) , special characters ( e . g . ‘ & # 39 ; ’ ) , punctuation , and superfluous white spaces were removed from questions . Ques - tions were converted to lowercase . Frequently occurring words with little topic predictive value ( ’stopwords’ ) were removed from questions . Words in the questions were stemmed ( i . e . converted to 10 A detailed description of the database schema used across forums is provided by Stack Exchange on their forum about the Stack Exchange network , appropriately named Meta Stack Exchange , accessible at https : / / meta . stackexchange . com / questions / 2677 / database - schema - documentation - for - the - public - data - dump - and - sede . 11 The Stack Exchange Data Dump can be accessed at : https : / / archive . org / details / stackexchange . The database is updated weekly . 12 In studies of more niche topics only one tag has been used [ 134 ] , however , as in [ 3 ] , manual review demonstrated that there are no over - arching ML or ICP tags . 13 A significant advantage of the 𝑠𝑡𝑚 R package relied upon is that it enables manual setting of the random seeds used during the model training process—ensuring a higher degree of reproducability is possible .

The top three topics identified by the topic model and the cluster are reported in the caption of each image . their root form ) . The creation date of questions was converted into a numerical format . STM requires the researcher to set the number of latent topics ( 𝑘 ) to identify in a corpus . As such , selecting the optimal value for 𝑘 is an important decision , and requires testing a wide range of values [ 47 ] . Additional hyper - parameters can also be optimised , and different pre - processing regimes can also be tested against each other [ 46 , 85 ] . Given the preliminary nature of the study , 𝑘 values from 10 to 60 , at intervals of 5 were experimented with . The 𝑠𝑡𝑚 package’s built in multi - model testing feature was used : for each value of 𝑘 , up to 50 model runs , with a maximum of 100 iterations each , were tested to ensure model stability . To select an optimal value of 𝑘 two evaluation metrics were used : exclusivity and semantic coherence [ 114 ] . Exclusivity is a measure of the difference in key words associated with each topic , whilst semantic coherence is a measure of how internally consistent each topic’s key words are [ 147 ] . These measures tend to pull in oppo - site directions : exclusivity is likely to be optimised by increasing the number of topics , whilst semantic coherence can be optimised by decreasing the number of topics [ 114 ] . An optimal number of topics for social science research can be found by plotting exclu - sivity against semantic coherence for a range of 𝑘 values , and then choosing a value at which neither measure dominates [ 114 ] . How - ever , there is no ‘right’ value for 𝑘 [ 107 ] ; the aim is to find a value of 𝑘 that enables meaningful interpretation [ 47 , 114 , 132 ] . In this instance , as can be seen in Figure 4 in the Appendix , models with 𝑘 values of around 25 represented an optimal trade off between exclusivity and semantic coherence . After inspection of keywords AIES ’23 , August , 2023 , Montreal , QC , Canada Berman associated with each topic and representative questions , the model with a 𝑘 value of 30 was selected . 4 . 3 Interpretation of the topic model To interpret the results of the topic model Yotam Ophir and Dror Walter’s [ 95 , 142 ] three step process was followed . First , I qualita - tively interpreted the topics identified through review of the most probable words associated with each topic ( Figure 3a ) . Second , I analysed the relationships between topics by calculating their cor - relation , with a positive correlation indicating a high likelihood of two topics being found together in the one Stack Exchange question [ 111 , 112 ] . Third , I used a community detection algorithm to iden - tify clusters of topics and broader themes across the corpus ( Figure 3b ) . In particular , I used the Newman - Girvan method for commu - nity structure detection [ 92 ] , with the result being three clusters of topics . After review of the probable terms associated with topics within each cluster and representative questions , I labeled these clusters : infrastructure and inter - dependencies , data manipulation , and model training . As an additional final step , I made use of STM’s ability to calculate the impact of covariates on topic prevalence to analyse the expected proportion of individual topics ( Figure 3c ) and clusters of topics over time ( Figure 3d ) . Throughout the above steps I moved between analysis of the topic model itself and deeper review of full Stack Exchange question and answer threads that are representative of particular topics or clusters of topics . Here , I adapted the approach of Paul DiMagg - gio , Manish Nag , and David Blei [ 34 ] , who , after training a topic model , identify topics of interest and then undertake analysis of the most representative texts for those topics . In particular , I identified the 10 Stack Exchange questions with the highest probability for each topic , and the 10 questions with the combined highest aver - age probability across topics within each cluster . For these highly representative questions , within each topic cluster I further sorted the questions by their view count on the Stack Exchange forums ( Figures 6 - 8 in the Appendix ) , enabling me to identify questions that were both highly representative of a given topic cluster and highly viewed on the Stack Exchange forum . 5 FINDINGS The topic model of Stack Exchange questions discussing interactive computing platforms and ML demonstrates that interactive com - puting platforms are implicated in a wide range of ML practices . ML practices are often conceptualised within a life cycle framework , with stages of ML development moving from problem formulation , to data curation and processing , to model training and evaluation , to model deployment and ongoing monitoring [ e . g . 7 , 75 , 88 , 105 , 106 ] . Figure 3a shows the most probable terms associated with each topic , and the expected proportion of each topic across the corpus . Unsur - prisingly , given the corpus focus on ICPs , the two topics most widely represented in the dataset—13 and 5—are associated with Google Co - lab and Jupyter Notebook respectively . The most probable terms for most other topics are associated with many of the ML development stages , particularly data curation and processing ( e . g . see key terms for topics 28 , 4 , and 21 ) , and model training and evaluation ( e . g . see key terms for topics 19 , 11 , 7 , and 12 ) . The deeper review of identi - fied topics and representative questions highlights two inter - related themes , which address the study’s research question regrading use of ICPs in ML practices : the use of ICPs as learning laboratories ; and , their role as coordination hubs across ML infrastructures . 5 . 1 Learning laboratories for Machine Learning Interactive computing platforms serve as ML practice learning lab - oratories : they enable users to experiment with each other’s code and publicly - available datasets , learn how code functions through line - by - line interactions , and redeploy code in their own use cases . ICPs are thus part of the sociomaterial context for what Louise Amoore has described as the “ partial , iterative and experimental ” nature of ML practices [ 4 ] , which is also reflected in Langenkamp and Yue’s broader study of open source tools [ 72 ] . 14 Figure 1 shows an example of an ICP used as a learning labora - tory , drawn from a tutorial for PyTorch , an ML - focused high - level programming language . Figure 2b shows an example of a Stack Overflow question , titled ‘ Keras , how do I predict after I trained a model ? ” , which also reflects the use of an ICP as a learning labora - tory . This is one of the four most viewed questions from the data manipulation cluster of topics . The author of this question appears to be engaged in a learning practice : they describe themselves as “ playing with ” the dataset , and write that they have “ read about ” saving a trained model , but are now struggling to use the saved model in a prediction task . Not shown in Figure 2b are the com - munity answers the author received . 15 Each answer also includes a code snippet , demonstrating a solution . Similarly , the question “ FailedPreconditionError : Attempting to use uninitialized in Tensor - flow ” ( Figure 2c ) , one of the most viewed questions in the model training cluster , includes a code snippet that is “ from the TensorFlow tutorial ” , which the author is attempting to use with “ digit recogni - tion data from Kaggle ” . In both these questions users’ learning is through an ICP , and is focused on understanding how to achieve a specific task using the Application Programming Interface ( API ) of a particular high - level programming library . When ML practitioners use interactive computing platforms as learning laboratories they engage in practices of code and data reuse . The author of the Stack Overflow question discussed above notes they are “ playing with the reuters - example dataset ” , which is a publicly - available dataset used in topic modelling and text clas - sification tasks [ 79 ] , and provides a code snippet to illustrate the point at which they require assistance . Within ML practices reuse of publicly available datasets , such as the Reuters dataset for text classification or the ImageNet dataset for computer vision is well documented [ 32 ] . Patterns of dataset reuse can be found across the corpus : the Reuters dataset is referend in 11 questions ; ImageNet dataset is mentioned in 436 questions ; and , the MNIST handwrit - ten digits dataset is mentioned in 834 . Indirect evidence of code and data reuse in ML practices can also be found by reviewing the code snippets included in questions in the corpus . As discussed in Section 4 , during pre - processing code snippets were isolated from the text of questions on which the topic model was trained . 14 Foranextendeddescriptionoftherelationshipbetweenlearningpracticesanddigital infrastructures see [ 49 ] . 15 The full question , including community provided answers can be seen as : https : / / stackoverflow . com / questions / 37891954 / keras - how - do - i - predict - after - i - trained - a - model . Machine Learning practices and infrastructures AIES ’23 , August , 2023 , Montreal , QC , Canada Of all questions , 89 . 7 % include a code snippet . Because the corpus consists of questions about using ICPs , many of these code snippets represent the point at which a user of an ICP has become stuck while trying to attempt to an ML related task . This is illustrated by the question titled “ How to load CSV file in Jupyter ? ” , shown in Figure 2d . Here , the author of the question has included in the body of their question a screenshot of their Jupyter Notebook . As can be seen , the first cell in this notebook begins with the 𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡 function , which is how specific programming libraries or sub - libraries are im - ported into the ICP . In this case , the author has imported 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑝𝑦 , a mathematical functions library , and 𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑠 , a data analysis library . More broadly , the code snippets included in questions shed light on the substance of code that is entered into ICPs during ML related tasks . By calculating the frequency of the terms that immediately follow the 𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡 function , widely used programming libraries can be identified ( see Figure 5 in the Appendix ) . Among the 15 most frequently mentioned programming libraries in code snippets are : ‘Sequential’ , ‘Dense’ , and ‘Model’ ( specific components from Keras , a high - level library for deep learning ) ; ’cv2’ ( a computer vision high - level library ) ; and , ‘PyTorch’ ( an alternative to TensorFlow ) . The code snippet in the question titled “ FailedPreconditionError : Attempting to use uninitialized in Tensorflow ” , shown in Figure 2c , illustrates the significance of 𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡 functions for extending the abilities of ICPs both as learning laboratories and more generally . The code snippet includes the line : 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 _ 𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑝 = 𝑡𝑓 . 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 . 𝐺𝑟𝑎𝑑𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡𝐷𝑒𝑠𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑂𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑟 Across the corpus , 120 questions reference TensorFlow’s Gradi - entDescentOptimizer . Gradient Descent is a type of optimisation algorithm used during training of a neural network [ 117 ] . This line of code enables the user to access the TensorFlow library’s operationalisation of gradient descent algorithms through its API— alleviating the need for the user to code their own gradient descent algorithm . While TensorFlow is only one of a number of similar software libraries available , the volume of posts ( 38 . 6 % of all ques - tions ) in the corpus in which TensorFlow is mentioned , and the two most probable terms in topic 15 ( ‘import’ and ‘tensorflow’ ) , provides some indication of its widespread use in ICPs and ML practices . 5 . 2 Coordination hubs for ML infrastructures Assembling an ML workflow is a complex task , requiring coordina - tion of multiple infrastructures . Interactive computing platforms serve as coordination hubs , through which networks of infrastruc - tures are assembled to support ML practices . Reflecting this , as shown in Figure 3d , the cluster of topics associated with infrastruc - ture and inter - dependencies accounts for a significantly greater proportion of questions in the corpus than the cluster of topics associated with model training . The most viewed questions within the infrastructure and inter - dependencies cluster reveal the infras - tructural coordination that is at the heart of many ML practices . One of the most viewed questions within the infrastructure and inter - dependencies cluster is titled “ Can I run Keras model on gpu ? ” ( Figure 2a ) . 16 Keras is a high - level API designed to support deep 16 See https : / / stackoverflow . com / questions / 45662253 / can - i - run - keras - model - on - gpu for the full question and its answer thread . learning techniques . 17 Keras is integrated into TensorFlow , and enables users to build a wide range of neural networks—Keras makes it easier and more efficient to complete deep learning tasks within TensorFlow . A GPU—Graphics Processing Unit—is a spe - cialised microprocessor , which in many computing systems works alongside the more general - purpose Central Processing Unit ( CPU ) microprocessor . Whilst the GPU - CPU arrangement predates the emergence of Deep Learning , it turns out that GPU microprocessors are better suited to performing many of the computations required to train a neural network than CPUs . The author of this question is attempting to assemble a system that consists of a “ Tensorflow backend ” and a “ Keras model ” , interacted with through a “ Jupyter notebook ” , and run on their computer’s GPU . The highest scoring answer recommends installing CUDA , which is an additional par - allel programming platform designed to enable GPUs to be used for non - graphics processing tasks , such as model training . This answer provides hyperlinks to additional resources for installing CUDA and checking that TensorFlow is running properly on a GPU . Above this answer are two further user comments also linking to additional resources . As such , the author of this question is assem - bling a system that involves at least five interdependent layers : GPU , CUDA , TensorFlow , Keras , Juypter Notebook . The author is fortunate , however , as their aim is to train their model within “ 36 hours ” , which suggests that either they have access to a powerful GPU , or they are training a model with a relatively small dataset ( for instance , as part of a learning exercise ) . In industrial or research settings , training a neural network requires access to much greater compute resources , which requires users to access a cloud resource , such as Amazon Web Services , and adds at least one additional layer of complexity to the system . The key words associated with topics within the infrastructure and inter - dependencies cluster ( shown in Figure 3a ) provide an additional perspective on the infrastructural coordination required to support ML tasks . In descending order of representation in the corpus , these topics are : 13 , 5 , 15 , 12 , 14 , 23 , 22 , 30 , and 10 . As al - ready observed , topics 13 and 5 relate to Google Colab and Jupter Notebook , two ICPs . Meanwhile , topic 15 includes ‘import’ and ‘ten - sorflow’ as the two most probable terms . Topic 23 includes ‘gpu’ , ‘cpu’ , and ‘cuda’ as probable terms . Topic 22 includes ‘tensorflow’ and ‘tpu’ , which is a reference to Tensor Processing Units , which are a new generation of GPUs specifically designed to support Ten - sorFlow . The presence of these topics , and their close correlations , as shown in Figure 3b , indicate that coordination between infras - tructures is widely discussed on Stack Exchange . Finally , Figure 3d shows the expected proportion of topic 13 ( Google Colab ) compared to topic 5 ( Jupyter Notebook ) over time . The topic model estimates that since 2017 questions related to Google Colab have increased compared to questions related to Jupyter Notebook . Significantly , a key point of difference between these two platforms is that Google Colab has been designed to integrate directly into Google’s cloud compute infrastructure , and is used as the platform of choice in TensorFlow and Keras tutorials . 17 See https : / / keras . io / for an introduction to Keras .

The findings indicate that ICPs are learn - ing laboratories—tools by which users experiment with and learn ML practices through line - by - line interaction with others’ code and publicly available datasets , facilitated by the APIs provided by high - level programming languages . The findings show also that ICPs are coordination hubs—sites at which multiple different infrastructures are brought together to support ML practices , such as model train - ing or data processing . Given the role ICPs play as coordination hubs for ML practices , they can be conceptualised as an emerging form of ‘digital infrastructure’—an essential and widely participated in sociotechnical system [ 19 , 104 ] . Conceptualising ICPs in this way enables existing theorising about infrastructures to inform consid - eration of the sociopolitical significance of ICP use in ML practices , and helps connect ICP use to concerns raised in AI ethics discourse . To illustrate this , in the following subsections I consider how Brian Larkin’s review of anthropological practices for studying infras - tructure [ 73 ] and Susan Leigh Star’s description of the properties of infrastructure [ 130 ] can apply to ICPs . In each subsection I conclude with a brief reflection on implications for AI ethics discourse . Machine Learning practices and infrastructures AIES ’23 , August , 2023 , Montreal , QC , Canada 6 . 1 An emerging infrastructural relationship As material objects , Larkin describes infrastructures as “ built net - works that facilitate the flow of goods , people , or ideas ” [ 73 , p . 328 ] . At the same time , infrastructures are systems that support the func - tioning of other objects , and it is these objects that users of an infrastructure experience ; we experience hot water , not plumb - ing [ 73 , p . 329 ] . Star describes this characteristic of infrastructure as ‘transparency’ : for users of an infrastructure , the tasks associ - ated with it seem easy and straightforward—transparent [ 130 ] . Star , however , understands infrastructures as relational . Transparency is not an inherent characteristic of a sociotechnical system , but rather a characteristic of an infrastructural relationship between a sociotechnical system and its users . The topic model of Stack Exchange questions is a snapshot of an emerging infrastructural relationship : as ML practitioners use ICPs as coordination hubs , facilitating flows of data and code across networks of disparate resources ( compute capacity , programming languages , datasets , etc . ) , they are forming an infrastructural re - lationship with the platform . The platform itself recedes into the background and the objects that the platform enables to function— predictive models—come into the foreground . This is why ICPs excel as learning laboratories for ML . The affordances of the ICP , however , continue to have efficacy even as the platform itself be - comes transparent : the affordances enable and constrain users , and in doing so help configure practices associated with the ML tech - niques that the platform enables [ 30 , 31 ] . Star’s understanding of infrastructures as relational also high - lights the relationship between infrastructures and groups : infras - tructures are “ learned as part of membership ” [ 130 , p . 381 ] . This conceptualisation of the relationship between infrastructures and group membership appears to align closely to the burgeoning in - frastructural relationship between ML practitioners and ICPs . As the topic model interpretation illustrates , ML practitioners learn to use an ICPs as part of the process of becoming ‘ML practitioners’ . Star highlights that shared use of common infrastructures among practitioners helps reinforce their identity as a distinct group [ 130 ] . Non - members , meanwhile , encounter infrastructures as things they need to learn to use in order to integrate into a group . Note , for ex - ample , the author’s phrasing in the Stack Overflow question shown in Figure 2d : “ I’m new and studying machine learning . . . I’m getting problems about loading the CSV File into the Jupyter Notebook ” . ‘ML practitioner’ is an ill - defined term frequently used in AI ethics discourse as a catchall for describing the data scientists , software engineers , and product managers who work on the research and development of ML systems . From an infrastructural perspective , however , the term can also be thought of symbolising a new set of infrastructural relations : where previously data scientists , software engineers , etc . , each worked within their own suites of tools , in - creasingly they use shared infrastructure , such as ICPs , enabling the collapsing of distinctions between these professional roles that is indicated in the term ‘ML practitioner’ . 6 . 1 . 1 Implications for AI ethics . A stream of AI ethics research has focused on the development of software and management tools to support ML practitioners ( see [ 88 ] for an overview ) . For this stream , ICPs may be a constraint , in so far as tool adoption is often held to be dependent on integration with existing ML infrastructure and practices [ e . g . 40 , 50 ] . Alternatively , the affordances of ICPs may offer new opportunities for future tool development . The grammar of ICP interactions may be applied to the design of tools intended to prompt practitioner reflection . The open source Fairlearn library , for example , provides example ICP notebooks 18 to demonstrate library uses . More broadly , however , as ICPs contribute to the configuring of ML practices , they shape the space in which AI ethics are situated . Here , Britt Paris’s [ 97 ] reflections on the relationship between In - ternet infrastructure and constructions of time are instructive . ICPs , like the Internet at large , imagine particular temporal relations . ICPs , in particular , are premised on speed : the staccato call - and - response of user inputs and computer outputs helps configures a working environment in which the value of ML practices resides in their speed and efficiency . In this sense , conceptualising ICPs as ML infrastructure presents as a challenge to calls from AI ethics researchers for greater reflexivity in ML [ e . g . 37 , 146 ] . 6 . 2 Visible and invisible infrastructures As material objects , infrastructures are designed , and reflect , at least in part , the intentions of the designer . Yet , at the same time , infrastructures are “ built on an installed base ” , often following paths of development laid down by preceding infrastructures [ 130 , p . 382 ] . And , infrastructures are often caught in circular webs of relations with other infrastructures : computers rely on the electricity grid to function , and the functioning of the modern electricity grid is reliant on computers [ 73 ] . Infrastructures therefore cannot be understood in isolation , in the same way that they cannot be designed in isola - tion . The role ICPs play as coordination hubs reflect this : they are built on top of the networked and decentralised infrastructures of the Internet , programming languages , and computing . In doing so , ICPs augment and extend these pre - existing infrastructures , both following path dependencies established by these infrastructures and charting new paths for future infrastructures [ cf . 148 ] . Larkin highlights that infrastructures also serve a ‘poetic’ func - tion [ 73 ] . Larkin draws on linguist Roman Jakobson’s concept of poetics [ 62 ] , which holds that in some speech acts the palpable qualities of speech ( roughly , sound patterns ) have primary impor - tance over representational qualities ( i . e . meaning ) . Infrastructures , argues Larkin , can have a poetic function , not reflected in the de - clared intentions of designers , nor in their technical capabilities [ 73 ] . Researchers of infrastructure , then , must take seriously the aesthetic aspects of infrastructure , and consider how infrastructures not only reflect the declared intention of those who build them , but also their ( undeclared ) interests . Larkin’s description of the poetics of infrastructure mirrors Jenna Burrell’s critique of blithe descriptions of algorithms as ’opaque’ , which ignore the ways the appearance of opaqueness in an algorithmic system can reflect the politics of the institutions who operate them [ 26 ] . In this context , a significant line of future inquiry pertains to the different politics and interests reflected in the two ICPs identified as widely used by the topic model : Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab . For Larkin , the aesthetic aspects of infrastructure include the way infrastructures may at times appear transparent or invisible [ 73 ] . Here , Larkin takes issue with Star’s description of infrastructures 18 See https : / / fairlearn . org / v0 . 8 / auto _ examples / index . html . AIES ’23 , August , 2023 , Montreal , QC , Canada Berman as ‘invisible’ . Star describes this characteristic of infrastructure as " becoming visible upon breakdown " [ 130 , p . 382 ] . By standardising in - teractions between material objects , users , and other infrastructures , infrastructures become transparent to users , and , when this trans - parency becomes routine , the infrastructure itself appears invisible . Questions asked on Stack Exchange can thus be interpreted as in - stances of ML infrastructure becoming visible . To Larkin , however , the claim that infrastructures are invisible can only ever be partially valid : what the affordances of infrastructures make visible and in - visible is both an outcome a system’s technical capabilities and its poetic functions . Larkin and Star’s debate on invisibility thus helps shed light on the mechanism by which ICPs become implicated in the characteristics of ML systems that are developed through their use . As infrastructural systems , ICPs standardise a particular form of presenting and interacting with code—the ‘notebook’ layout of descriptive and computation cells described in Section 2 . 2—and this standardisation renders some aspects of ML system development more visible to ML practitioners than others . Shifts in the aspects of ML system development that are transpar - ent to ML practitioners can have significant impacts on practition - ers’ understanding of ML technologies . As discussed in Section 5 . 1 , ICPs support iterative experimentation with the APIs of high - level programming languages , which often occurs through probing and re - purposing of code written by others . Iterative experimentation with the API of a high - level programming language , however , is unlikely to reveal the full range of decisions that the creators of an API have made in operationalising a particular ML algorithm or technique . The point of Keras’ Tokenizer function ( shown in the code snippet in the Stack Overflow question in Figure 2b ) is that it enables users to convert the text in a corpus into a series of integers ( ‘embeddings’ ) , so that computations ( e . g . topic modelling ) can be run on the corpus . The function enables users to choose whether or not to convert text to lowercase , but because the function has a default setting , this choice is not necessary—by default any call of the Tokenizer function will convert text to lowercase before con - version to numerical form . 19 This may seem inconsequential , but it can have a significant downstream impact : converting a corpus to lowercase means that the verb ‘stack’ and proper noun ‘Stack’ will be embedded as semantically identical . As APIs of high - level programming languages become more sophisticated , particularly as they start to incorporate pre - trained models for common ML tasks ( e . g . image classification , object de - tection and labelling , sentiment detection ) , the choices obfuscated by the API become more consequential . The TensorFlow Object Detection notebook 20 uses a CenterNet pre - trained model which was trained on the Common Objects in Context dataset [ 81 ] . This dataset includes labels for 91 categories of objects , including ‘plate’ , ‘cup’ , ‘fork’ , ‘knife’ , ‘spoon’ , and ‘bowl’ ( but not , for instance , ‘chop - stick’ ) , and it is these objects that the CenterNet model can detect in images . This sequence of choices , and the constraints each choice imports into the ML system , are not surfaced by experimentation with the API in an ICP ; the infrastructural relationship between ML practitioners and ICPs renders transparent code reuse , but leaves detailed code knowledge opaque . 19 See https : / / www . tensorflow . org / api _ docs / python / tf / keras / preprocessing / text / Tokenizer for the Tokenizer documentation . 20 Accessible at https : / / www . tensorflow . org / hub / tutorials / tf2 _ object _ detection . 6 . 2 . 1 Implications for AI ethics . At stake in AI ethics discourse are questions of legitimacy . Arising from the recognition that code operationalises and reifies particular interpretations of essentially contested social constructs [ 20 , 60 , 89 ] is the challenge of locating where and how coding decisions are currently made , and where they ought to be made . What , if any , categories of gender ought to be included as labels in an image dataset [ 66 ] ? High - level APIs , interacted with through ICPs , obscure these decisions , and in doing so further entrench them in ML practices : what is unknown to ML practitioners is unquestioned . In this sense , the infrastructural relationship between practitioners and ICPs is an example of social arrangements helping configure ML practices as ’black boxes’ [ 26 ] , and is thus a new challenge to the efforts of AI ethics researchers to embed accountability for decision making in ML development [ 29 ] . 6 . 3 Development of infrastructures over time The role of coordination hub lends ICPs and the web of other infras - tructures they are related to ( compute resources , code repositories , etc . ) a semblance of hierarchical coherence . But , while infrastruc - tures may be presented as coherent , hierarchical structures , they are rarely built or managed in this way . Indeed , Jupyter Notebook began life as an open - source project focused on scientific computing within the Python programming language , before being adopted and adapted by ML practitioners and industry [ 45 ] . In this sense , the emergence of ICPs as infrastructure reflects a familiar process of adaptation and translation [ cf . 57 ] . Relevantly , Star highlights that infrastructures are fixed in modular increments [ 130 , p . 382 ] , with “ conventions of practice ” co - evolving alongside the develop - ment of the infrastructure itself [ 130 ] . Here , Elizabeth Shove’s work on the co - evolution of infrastructures and practices offers a poten - tial framework by which to explore how ICPs and ML practices co - evolve [ 124 , 125 ] . Watson and Shove argue that infrastructural relations and prac - tices co - evolve through processes of aggregation and integration [ 145 ] . Aggregation refers to “ the ways in which seemingly localised experiences and practices combine and , in combining , acquire a life of their own ” [ 145 , p . 2 ] . Individual ML practitioners , for example , each develop their own approach to coordinating the different layers of infrastructure needed to support ML tasks . However , as individuals share their approaches , and these coalesce into con - ventions , the conventions themselves shape future infrastructure development . The convention of using GPUs for model training , for example , creates the demand needed to justify the development of more specialised TPUs . Integration refers to ways that policies , processes , and artefacts at the level of the overarching infrastruc - ture are “ brought together in the performance of practices enacted across multiple sites [ 145 , p . 2 ] . Google , for example , sets various policies regarding the availability of Google’s GPU resources to users of Google Colab . These policy decisions ( e . g . the decision to offer limited free access to GPUs ) in turn are integrated into individual users’ ML practices—top - down policy decisions help inform the future development of conventions of practice , but do not determine them . For the field of AI ethics , the framework of aggregation and integration offers a path towards understanding how norms in ML practices , such as the use of particular opera - tionalisations of fairness metrics , co - evolve as a product of both Machine Learning practices and infrastructures AIES ’23 , August , 2023 , Montreal , QC , Canada the integration of particular fairness approaches into high - level programming languages and the aggregation of local approaches to ‘managing’ ethics issues into shared practices . 6 . 3 . 1 Implications for AI ethics . Conceptualising interactive com - puting platforms as an emerging form of ‘digital infrastructure’ situates them alongside other digital ’platforms’ that have coalesced into infrastructures ( e . g . WeChat [ 101 ] , Facebook [ 51 , 52 , 103 ] , and Google [ 103 ] ) . The prominence of these digital infrastructures in mediating contemporary life has led to the development of the plat - form governance field [ 43 ] . 21 Platform governance researchers have explored how digital infrastructures attempt to exercise governance over their users , and how digital infrastructures themselves can be more effectively governed . Robert Gorwa , for example , has stud - ied the governance of online content , particularly user - generated content on digital platforms [ 42 ] . As Gorwa argues , there is an increasing nexus between AI ethics discourse and platform gover - nance discourse : algorithmic systems , particularly predictive ML systems , are core components of the governance regimes of digital infrastructures [ 44 ] . Tarleton Gillespie , for example , critiques the positioning of ML tools as the solution to social media content moderation [ 41 ] . ICPs advance this nexus , but in the reverse di - rection : as the platforms have developed from software tools for scientific computing to general purpose coordination hubs for ML practices they have begun to integrate affordances more commonly associated with digital platforms . Google Colab , for example , in - tegrates directly into Google Drive—a widely used cloud storage and file sharing platform . We can interpret this integration as an effort to cultivate network effects [ 14 ] : if I care about sharing my notebook with others , then it makes sense that I will seek out the ICP that integrates directly with the file sharing system most of my colleagues use . But , to the extent that a notebook is ‘content’ , and the extent that this content may include ML models that have been shown to cause significant social harm , ICP operators have so far eluded responsibility for this content . For the field of AI ethics , then , the potential for ICP operators to exercise governance functions over ICP users may be worth further consideration . 7 LIMITATIONS Conceptually , as Eric Baumer and Micki McGee [ 11 ] argue , topic modelling risks using a statistical model of a corpus to speak on be - half of a social group . This risk is compounded by the fact that the so - cial group who generates content that enters a corpus ( in this study , people who ask questions on Stack Exchange forums ) may not be representative of the social group of interest to the study ( here , ML practitioners ) . Relevantly , among the Stack Overflow user base , as of 2016 , only 5 . 8 % of contributors were female [ 38 ] . Additionally , while there are versions of Stack Overflow in multiple languages , only the English - language version has been used in this study . As such , fu - ture research will need to validate the extent to which the practices identified in this study are representative of ML practitioners . The focus of Stack Exchange questions also presents a funda - mental limitation for studies of ML practitioners . Stack Exchange questions are points of trouble—they represent moments when a user has been unable to complete a task . As such , it may be the 21 Similarly , theemergenceofearlierinformationinfrastructuresledtothedevelopment of the internet governance field [ 53 ] and information infrastructure studies [ 20 ] . case that there are a range of practices that are not represented in the Stack Exchange corpus , simply because they are practices so familiar they do not necessitate asking any questions . Given the discussion on transparency and infrastructures in Section 6 . 1 , this means Stack Exchange questions can only offer a partial account of infrastructural relationships . There are also limitations inherent in the pre - processing and model training process outlined in Section 4 . 2 . In particular , stemming of words may have reduced the seman - tic depth of the topic model , as may have removal of code snippets from the corpus . The validation of topic models is an ongoing area of research [ 46 , 85 ] . As this is a preliminary study , no attempt has been made to externally validate the accuracy of the topics iden - tified ( e . g . through comparing the latent topics identified by the topic model to coded themes identified by expert human reviewers of the same corpus , as in [ 86 ] ) . More broadly , the approach taken in this study will benefit from complementary qualitative studies to both validate and contextualise findings ( e . g . ethnographic studies of practitioners in multiple social contexts [ 39 ] ) . 8 CONCLUSION Interactive computing platforms , such as Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab , are widely used by ML practitioners . In this paper , I conducted a topic model analysis of user - contributed questions on the Stack Exchange forums related to interactive computing plat - forms and ML . I found interactive computing platforms are used by ML practitioners in two categories of practices : in learning practices , particularly to support probing and reuse of others’ code ; and , in coordination practices , to help marshal the various infrastructures needed to enact ML tasks . I argued that these practices constitute an emerging infrastructural relationship between ML practitioners and interactive computing platforms , in which both the platforms and ML practices are co - evolving . I highlighted several consequences of this infrastructuralisation , in terms of configuring the space in which AI ethics operates and responds to , designing interventions in ML practices , making visible the operationalisation in code of social constructs , and the platform power of ICP operators . As the ML field advances , a pressing issue is therefore the relationship between the social context ICPs form part of and the characteristics of ML systems that are developed . Tracing these relations is critical for resisting the enclosure of AI ethics by a set of social arrange - ments that may themselves be contributing to the production and deployment of harmful ML systems .
