The UNC - 6 / netrin , SLT - 1 / slit , and VAB - 2 / Ephrin guidance cues , and their receptors , UNC - 40 / DCC , SAX - 3 / Robo , and VAB - 1 / Eph , are known to be major regulators of cellular growth and migration . One important area of research is identifying the molecules that interpret this guidance information downstream of the guidance receptors to reorganize the actin cytoskeleton . However , how guidance cues regulate the actin cytoskeleton is not well understood . We report here that UNC - 40 / DCC , SAX - 3 / Robo , and VAB - 1 / Eph differentially regulate the abundance and subcellular localization of the WAVE / SCAR actin nucleation complex and its activator , Rac1 / CED - 10 , in the Caenorhabditis elegans embryonic epidermis . Loss of any of these three pathways results in embryos that fail embryonic morphogenesis . Similar defects in epidermal enclosure have been observed when CED - 10 / Rac1 or the WAVE / SCAR actin nucleation complex are missing during embryonic development in C . elegans . Genetic and molecular experiments demonstrate that in fact , these three axonal guidance proteins differentially regulate the levels and membrane enrichment of the WAVE / SCAR complex and its activator , Rac1 / CED - 10 , in the epidermis . Live imaging of filamentous actin ( F - actin ) in embryos developing in the absence of individual guidance receptors shows that high levels of F - actin are not essential for polarized cell migrations , but that properly polarized distribution of F - actin is essential . These results suggest that proper membrane recruitment and activation of CED - 10 / Rac1 and of WAVE / SCAR by signals at the plasma membrane result in polarized F - actin that permits directed movements and suggest how multiple guidance cues can result in distinct changes in actin nucleation during morphogenesis .

Understanding how cells respond to signals is particularly complicated in developing embryos where tissues , or groups of cells of related identity , must often respond to multiple migration signals while maintaining the integrity of the migrating tissue . It has been proposed that outside signals lead to cellular movements through the rearrangement of the F - actin cytoskeleton . However , the details of how this is accomplished are still being worked out . Ultimately , understanding this process will require understanding how the outside signals are able to organize the cellular cytoskeleton . In this study we addressed what specific changes in the actin cytoskeleton occurred when different migration signals were removed . In addition , we asked if changes in the levels or localization of specific F - actin regulators in response to the migration signals could explain the changes in the actin cytoskeleton and in cell migration . Studies in C . elegans have identified three pathways that guide the migrations of axons during development . C . elegans forward genetic screens led to the identification of the netrin / UNC - 6 cue that signals to the UNC - 40 / DCC receptor to guide axonal migrations in larvae [ 1 , 2 ] . Two additional signaling pathways , ephrin and Robo signaling , guide axonal migrations in C . elegans larvae [ 3 – 6 ] . In addition , ephrin and Robo signaling contribute to the epidermal cellular migrations that result in epiboly in C . elegans embryos . The ephrin VAB - 2 / EFN - 1 and its Eph receptor VAB - 1 , the only C . elegans Eph receptor tyrosine kinase , are required in embryonic neuroblasts to permit epidermal cell enclosure [ 7 , 8 ] . SAX - 3 / Robo is essential during embryonic morphogenesis , with requirements within both the migrating epidermis and the underlying neuroblasts for epidermal cell migrations [ 9 ] . In contrast , the ligand for SAX - 3 / Robo , SLT - 1 , has no embryonic phenotype on its own , suggesting that SAX - 3 either has additional ligands besides SLT - 1 , or does not need a ligand to mediate its embryonic effects [ 10 ] . Netrin / UNC - 6 and its receptor , UNC - 40 , have not been examined for epidermal cell migration defects during embryonic development , although neuronal and mesoder - PLoS Genetics | www . plosgenetics . org 1 August 2012 | Volume 8 | Issue 8 | e1002863 mal cell migration defects were reported [ 1 ] . In addition , tagged UNC - 6 and rescuing UNC - 40 / DCC transgenes are expressed in embryos [ 2 , 11 ] . Cell migrations in the embryo require dynamic rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton . Our previous studies have identified an actin nucleation pathway , including the small GTPase CED - 10 / Rac1 , the WAVE / SCAR complex and the Arp2 / 3 complex , as essential components for embryonic morphogenesis [ 12 ] . Muta - tions or depletion by RNAi of the GTPase CED - 10 / Rac1 , any WAVE / SCAR component , or any Arp2 / 3 component result in complete loss of epidermal cell shape changes and cell movements . The resulting loss of epidermal cell migration leads to the Gex ( gut on the exterior ) phenotype first described for WAVE / SCAR complex components GEX - 2 / Sra1 / p140 / PIR121 / CYFIP and GEX - 3 / NAP1 / HEM2 / Kette [ 12 , 13 ] . The Arp2 / 3 complex nucleates branched actin polymers , however it is a poor actin nucleator until it is activated by Nucleation Promoting Factors ( NPFs ) like WAVE / SCAR . The WAVE / SCAR complex is thought to be activated through membrane recruitment by the small GTPase Rac . Of the three C . elegans Rac - like GTPases , we have proposed that CED - 10 / Rac1 functions like the upstream Rac that recruits WAVE / SCAR during embryonic development . We based this proposal on the strong ced - 10 morphogenesis phenotype that is almost as strong as loss of WAVE / SCAR components or Arp2 / 3 [ 12 , 13 ] . It is not known which external signals reorganize the actin cytoskeleton through Arp2 / 3 , nor the impact of distinct signals on the actin cytoskeleton . In addition , what happens downstream of Rac signaling is not well understood . Elegant genetic studies in C . elegans neurons have identified complex genetic regulation of actin regulators downstream of multiple Rac GTPases [ 14 ] . However , as is true in other organisms , the consequences of Rac signaling on the actin cytoskeleton have not been made clear . Genetic and molecular studies have suggested that axonal guidance pathways may reorganize F - actin through effects on Rac signaling [ 15 ] . Genetic studies suggest UNC - 40 / DCC signals through CED - 10 / Rac1 in neurons [ 16 ] while in vitro studies show that Netrin can activate Rac1 through DCC [ 17 – 19 ] . Mammalian studies suggest that the unengaged Eph receptor is permissive for Rac activation , while Ephrin activation leads to RhoA activation , Rac inactivation , and actin depolymerization [ 20 , 21 ] . In Slit - Robo signaling , activation of Robo receptors by SLIT leads to Rac activation [ 22 , 23 ] . Studies in Drosophila suggest that the Robo receptor signals through the Rac GTPase [ 22 , 24 ] . In this study we show that three guidance pathways , netrin / DCC , SLIT / Robo and ephrin , regulate embryonic morphogen - esis and F - actin polarization through effects on the WAVE / SCAR complex . The receptors in all three pathways are required for the proper levels and organization of F - actin in the embryonic epidermis . All three regulate the subcellular distribution and levels of molecules that are essential for embryonic morphogenesis : CED - 10 / Rac1 , the WAVE / SCAR complex and F - actin . Since each of the three guidance pathways has embryonic morphogen - esis defects similar to but milder than the loss of CED - 10 , WAVE / SCAR or Arp2 / 3 , we tested our hypothesis that the three cues are redundant for a shared morphogenesis function . We found instead that each cue promoted morphogenesis through distinct effects on CED - 10 / Rac1 , WAVE / SCAR and on epidermal F - actin . UNC - 40 / DCC regulated the membrane enrichment of CED - 10 , and promoted correct WVE - 1 subcellular distribution required for normal levels of F - actin nucleation , but polarization of F - actin was minimally affected . Thus signals from UNC - 40 / DCC are important for total F - actin levels , and less important for F - actin polarization required for migrations . This essential role of netrin signaling in embryos had probably been missed due to the low penetrance of the phenotypes . SAX - 3 positively regulated CED - 10 / Rac subcellular distribution , which led to WAVE / SCAR recruitment to membranes , and resulted in appropriate levels and polarization of F - actin in migrating cells . Finally , Eph signaling regulated CED - 10 distribution , which is required for the correct WAVE complex localization in the epidermis , resulting in properly polarized F - actin in the migrating epidermal cells . This shows that ephrin receptor strongly affects events in the epidermal cells required for polarized F - actin distribution . Thus , these studies illustrate that distinct signals at the plasma membrane result in differential effects on the F - actin regulating WAVE / SCAR complex , required for both the correct levels and polarization of the actin cytoskeleton during morphogenesis . Interestingly , the degree of F - actin polarization , rather than the total levels , seems to determine whether a cell can initiate migrations or not . Results Axonal guidance receptors are required for embryonic epidermal morphogenesis In order to identify the upstream signals that reorganize the actin cytoskeleton during embryonic morphogenesis , we took a candidate gene approach by searching for signaling receptors which shared loss - of - function phenotypes with mutations in the WAVE / SCAR complex , a major regulator of embryonic F - actin organization . C . elegans receptors that transmit signals upstream of embryonic actin regulators would be expected to be expressed in embryos , and their loss of function phenotype should include embryos with the Full Gex , or gut on the exterior phenotype seen 100 % of the time when WAVE / SCAR or Arp2 / 3 components are missing ( Figure 1A ) . They might also share the Gex post - embryonic phenotypes including the Egl or Egg laying defective phenotype [ 13 ] . Embryonic morphogenesis defects of UNC - 6 / Netrin and UNC - 40 / Netrin receptor mutants . The UNC - 40 / DCC re - ceptor came to our attention as a candidate Gex receptor due to its 60 % Egl and 100 % Dpy ( Dumpy ) phenotypes . Some Dpy mutants have altered body shape due to cytoskeletal and morphogenesis Author Summary Neurons and other cells are most dynamic during embryonic development . Later in life , a diminished developmental potential in mature neurons makes injuries difficult to treat . Neuronal regeneration studies have benefited from genetic studies that identified the mole - cules that work during embryonic development to give neurons their plasticity and dynamism . Growth and regeneration require dynamic changes in the actin cytoskeleton . In this study we ask how signals that are known to guide migrations of neurons and other cells during development and regeneration are able to reorga - nize the actin cytoskeleton . Understanding how multiple signals are integrated to control actin dynamics is essential for understanding how cellular movements are regulated in embryos and adults . We find that the actin - nucleation regulating WAVE / SCAR complex molecules , which are conserved from the C . elegans soil nematodes to human beings , are localized and regulated by axonal guidance signals during embryonic development . These studies illustrate a mechanism by which different signals reorga - nize cellular F - actin through their regulation of the actin regulating WAVE / SCAR complex . Axonal Cues Polarize F - Actin through WAVE / SCAR PLoS Genetics | www . plosgenetics . org 2 August 2012 | Volume 8 | Issue 8 | e1002863 Axonal Cues Polarize F - Actin through WAVE / SCAR PLoS Genetics | www . plosgenetics . org 3 August 2012 | Volume 8 | Issue 8 | e1002863 defects . However , unc - 40 mutants had not been examined for their embryonic epidermal phenotypes . Four different putative null alleles of unc - 40 ( e1430 , n324 , n473 , e271 ) , that are caused by missense mutations predicted to result in truncated UNC - 40 , and a deletion mutation in the UNC - 40 ligand , unc - 6 / netrin ( ev400 ) result in similar levels of embryonic lethality due to failure in morphogenesis ( Figure 1B , Table 1 ) . This was true even after all these independently obtained unc - 40 alleles and the unc - 6 deletion null allele were out - crossed to wild type twice to see if the lethality was caused by background differences or secondary mutations ( Table 1 ) . For example , unc - 40 ( n324 ) and unc - 6 ( ev400 ) embryos displayed complete arrest of the epidermal migrations , referred to here as the Full Gex morphogenesis phenotype , 7 % and 3 % of the time ( Figure 1B , Table 1 ) . In addition , another 7 % of unc - 40 and unc - 6 embryos undergo partial enclosure of the epidermis ( referred to here as the Partial Gex phenotype ( Figure 1A , 1B ; Table 1 ) . To better image the changes in cell movements in live embryos these mutations were crossed into a dlg - 1 : : gfp transgene ( xnIs16 ) [ 25 ] that visualizes cell - cell junctions in epithelia . unc - 40 and unc - 6 embryos were observed to arrest the epidermal migrations at different stages resulting in the Full and Partial Gex phenotypes ( Figure 1B ) . Thus , both Netrin / UNC - 6 and its receptor UNC - 40 / DCC are required for epidermal morphogenetic movements . The finding that UNC - 6 / netrin and its receptor UNC - 40 / DCC are involved in embryonic epidermal cell migrations led us to ask which other regulators of neuronal migrations might be contributing to this process . Both SLT - 1 / Robo and Ephrin pathways are known to affect embryonic morphogenesis in C . elegans [ 26 ] . We therefore compared the phenotypes of mutations in WAVE / SCAR to mutations in the receptors of these two additional guidance pathways : sax - 3 / Robo and vab - 1 / Eph . As previously reported , sax - 3 ( ky123 ) and vab - 1 ( dx31 ) , two deletion null alleles , lead to embryonic lethality in approximately half ( 45 % and 42 % respectively ) of the embryos [ 3 , 8 ] ( Figure 1 , Table 1 ) . Via DIC optics and by crossing sax - 3 ( ky123 ) and vab - 1 ( dx31 ) into the dlg - 1 : : gfp strain we observed that 3 % of sax - 3 and 2 % of vab - 1 embryos display the Full Gex phenotype , while the majority of the dying embryos , 42 % and 40 % respectively , display a partial enclosure phenotype , with frequent failures in head enclosure ( 11 % and 10 % ) and in pocket cell enclosure ( 32 % and 30 % , Figure 1B brackets , Table 1 ) . Therefore these three different guidance pathways contribute to embryonic morphogenesis . Genetic analysis of the contribution of the three guidance cues to embryonic epidermal morphogenesis The discovery that three signaling pathways , Netrin , Robo and Ephrin , were contributing to embryonic morphogenesis , but with weaker embryonic morphogenesis phenotypes than loss of WAVE / SCAR , led us to use double mutant analysis to test the hypothesis that these cues act redundantly during embryonic morphogenesis . This experiment was complicated by the fact that some double mutant combinations using null alleles are lethal [ 9 ] ( our unpublished observations ) . We therefore sometimes used combinations of one null allele and one hypomorphic allele . We predicted that if the pathways are redundant , then removing or reducing two pathways that activated WAVE / SCAR would lead to more penetrant Full Gex phenotypes . We found that all the double mutant combinations led to increased embryonic lethality , and synergistic increases in the Partial Gex lethality . However only the unc - 40 ; sax - 3 double mutant displayed a synergistic increase in the Full Gex phenotype ( Table 1 ) . The double mutants between the vab - 1 null allele , dx31 ( 2 % Full Gex ) and the putative null allele unc - 40 ( e1430 ) ( 3 % Full Gex ) or between the vab - 1 hypomorph , e2 ( 0 % Full Gex ) , and the sax - 3 null allele , ky123 , ( 3 % Full Gex ) resulted in only 6 % and 2 % Full Gex , respectively ( Table 1 , Figure 1C ) . These experiments did not support simple redundancy between the vab - 1 pathway and either the unc - 40 or sax - 3 pathway for the regulation of the WAVE complex and are better explained by the pathways having parallel inputs that result in the Gex phenotype . The double between the putative null unc - 40 ( e1430 ) ( 1 % Full Gex at 25 u C ) and the hypomorphic sax - 3 ( ky200ts ) allele ( 9 % Full Gex at 25 u C ) at the restrictive temperature ( 25 u C ) increased the Full Gex phenotype to 19 % ( Table 1 , Figure 1C ) . This synergistic effect on the Full Gex phenotype suggested that there is redundancy between the unc - 40 and sax - 3 pathways for activating the WAVE complex . Guidance pathway proteins regulate F - actin organization and levels in migrating embryonic cells Since loss of the guidance pathway proteins altered morphoge - netic movements , these proteins may be required for the organization of the actin cytoskeleton . We therefore analyzed the effects of the three guidance pathways on the plin - 26 : : vab - 10 ABD ( actin binding domain ) : : gfp ( mcIs51 ) transgene that permits live imaging of F - actin enrichment in the epidermis of embryos undergoing morphogenesis [ 12 , 27 ] . In wild - type embryos this transgene is expressed at high levels in the six rows of epidermal cells . Wild - type embryos have abundant F - actin that is dynami - cally enriched toward the leading edge of the ventral migrating cells . In particular , the two anterior Leading Cells ( LCs ) on each side , which are essential for guiding the ventral migration of the epidermis [ 28 ] , make large filopodial protrusions and form a broad lamellar front ( Figure 2A ) . The highest F - actin enrichment was seen , on average , 2 m m behind the protrusive front in the LCs . Loss of either arp - 2 or gex - 3 resulted in less actin at the leading edge and loss of filopodial protrusions and lamellar protrusions in the LCs [ 12 ] ( Figure 2A , 2C , Videos S1 and S2 ) . Figure 1 . Axonal guidance receptors are required for embryonic epidermal morphogenesis . ( A ) Comparison of morphogenesis in embryos with wild type , Partial Gex or Full Gex phenotypes . In wild type the epidermal cells ( blue ) enclose the embryo by , 400 minutes after first cleavage at 20 u C . By , 600 minutes the embryos elongate to the three - fold stage . In Partial Gex embryos epidermal cells do not fully enclose the embryo by 400 minutes , and by 600 minutes the internal organs ( green = pharynx , red = intestine ) partially extrude through epidermal gaps . In Full Gex embryos the epidermal cells completely fail cell migration and by 600 minutes the internal organs are fully extruded to the surface of the embryo .

Since sax - 3 and vab - 1 mutants have delayed gastrulation movements that precede epidermal migration , we timed the occurrence of actin - based events . The time intervals between first large protrusions of the pocket cells , ventral actin enrichment in the Leading Cells ( LCs ) , LC protrusion initiation , and ventral meeting of the LCs were increased in unc - 40 , sax - 3 , and vab - 1 mutants ( Figure 2B ) , and are reminiscent of the gastrulation cleft closure delays described for sax - 3 and vab - 1 [ 8 , 9 ] . We therefore used the first protrusion of the pocket cells , which occurs at 250 minutes in wild - type and mutant embryos , and the meeting of the LCs , which occurs at 320 minutes in wild - type embryos , but later in mutant embryos , as reference points , and measured actin accumulation relative to these events ( Figure 2B ) . Crossing the plin - 26 : : vab - 10 ABD : : gfp transgene into animals carrying putative null alleles of unc - 40 , unc - 6 , sax - 3 and vab - 1 illustrated the distinct effects of each axonal guidance pathway on epidermal F - actin . Most embryos missing unc - 40 or unc - 6 are able to enclose and live ( Figure 1B , Table 1 ) . Loss of unc - 40 or unc - 6 resulted in a significant decrease of overall F - actin levels in the ventral row of migrating epidermal cells for all time points observed , but undiminished protrusive activity . In the unc - 40 and unc - 6 embryos shown in Figure 2A all the ventral cells express low levels of F - actin , yet the LCs are still capable of protrusive activity including filopodial protrusions ( Videos S1 and S2 , Figure 2A , Figure 3 ) . Further , the distribution of F - actin from ventral to dorsal regions of the LCs showed similar ventralward enrichment as seen in wild - type embryos ( Figure 2D , 2E ) . The continued dynamic protrusions and the ventral F - actin enrichment explain the relatively mild embryonic lethality of unc - 40 and unc - 6 embryos . Close to half of the embryos missing sax - 3 ( 45 % ) fail to enclose and die ( Figure 1B , 1D , Table 1 ) . On average , sax - 3 embryos had decreased ventral F - actin levels by 330 minutes ( Figure 2A , 2C , Videos S1 and S2 ) . These embryos were delayed in initiating ventralward movements ( Figure 2B ) , especially in the LCls ( Figure 1B , Figure 2A ) , and show decreased ventralward enrichment of F - actin ( Figure 2D , 2E ) . Close to half of the embryos missing vab - 1 ( 42 % ) fail to enclose and die ( Figure 1 , Table 1 ) . Loss of vab - 1 resulted in increased levels of epidermal F - actin in the ventral - most row of epidermal cells by 300 minutes ( Figure 2A ) , but disorganization of the F - actin distribution ( Figure 2E ) . vab - 1 mutant embryos maintained high F - actin levels at the leading edge ( Figure 2C ) , but had inappropri - ately increased enrichment of F - actin on the dorsal side of the LCs ( Figure 2A , 2D , 2E ) . The LCs were delayed in making filopodia or lamella compared to wild type ( Figure 2A , 2B , Videos S1 and S2 ) . Thus ephrin signaling supports ventrally enriched F - actin distri - bution that correlates with the timely migration of the epidermal cells and with successful enclosure . The dynamic turnover of F - actin protrusions is altered in morphogenesis mutants The F - actin movies were captured at 2 - minute intervals to minimize phototoxicity , so we could not measure rapid changes in actin dynamics . However , the movies show that in wild type , Table 1 . Distribution of embryonic morphogenesis phenotypes .

These dynamic changes contribute to the ventralward migration of the cells . In contrast , in the WAVE / SCAR and axonal guidance mutants , protrusions often formed and retracted more slowly , leading to minimal changes at the leading edge . In wild type , unc - 40 or unc - 6 embryos , protrusions lasted , on average , 2 . 5 to 3 minutes , and the majority of embryos enclosed . In contrast in gex - 3 , sax - 3 and vab - 1 embryos , protrusions lasted 9 , 6 and 6 minutes , respectively , and 100 % , 45 % and 42 % of the embryos failed to enclose ( Figure 3 ) . Guidance receptors affect subcellular distribution of Rac1 / CED - 10 Rac1 / CED - 10 regulates the levels and subcellular distribution of WVE - 1 . Since guidance receptor mutants shared phenotypes with CED - 10 and WAVE / SCAR mutants , we decided to test if the guidance cues directly affected CED - 10 / Rac1 and WAVE / SCAR . Cell surface receptors are proposed to activate CED - 10 / Rac1 , and GTP - bound Rac1 is able to bind to the WAVE / SCAR component GEX - 2 / Sra1 / p140 / PIR121 / CY - FIP , which in turn recruits the rest of the WAVE complex to the membrane [ 29 – 31 ] . We first tested if loss of ced - 10 altered WVE - 1 levels or distribution and found changes in both . The ced - 10 ( n1993 ) hypomorphic allele contains a mutation in a prenylation site predicted to bring CED - 10 to the plasma membrane [ 32 ] . The ced - 10 ( n1993 ) mutation reduced the apparent GFP : : WVE - 1 levels in 26 of 28 embryos examined ( Figure 5A ) and reduced GFP : : WVE - 1 enrichment relative to the basolateral protein UNC - 70 / beta spectrin [ 33 ] ( Figure 5B ) . Whole worm or embryonic ced - 10 ( n1993 ) lysates ( Materials and Methods ) contain lower levels of endogenous WVE - 1 ( Figure 5C ) . Performing subcellular fractionations ( Materials and Methods ) we previously showed that the low speed P1 pellet is enriched in plasma membrane proteins , including PH : : GFP , and in large membra - nous organelles like the Golgi . We proposed that pellet enrichment reflects membrane association of proteins [ 34 ] . Control lysates showed that in wild - type animals the low speed pellet ( P1 ) contains 24 % of endogenous WVE - 1 . Fractionated ced - 10 ( n1993 ) lysates showed large increases in WVE - 1 enrichment in the P1 and P2 pellets ( Figure 5E ) , suggesting that CED - 10 regulates the recruitment of WVE - 1 to the correct membranes . Effects of receptor mutants on CED - 10 : : GFP . Given the clear connection between Rac1 / CED - 10 and the levels and localization of WVE - 1 , we analyzed the effects of the three guidance pathways on the subcellular distribution and levels of CED - 10 utilizing the rescuing transgene , ced - 10 : : gfp [ 35 ] , which we integrated into the genome using UV - TMP . In wild - type embryos undergoing epidermal cell migrations this transgene shows a similar basolaterally enriched epidermal expression pattern , basal to the apical junction component AJM - 1 ( Figure 4A ) , as we have reported for F - actin and for other WAVE / SCAR components , GEX - 2 and GFP : : GEX - 3 [ 12 , 13 ] . The dorsal epidermal cells highlighted in Figure 4 are undergoing convergent extension - like dorsal intercalation movements that require the WAVE / SCAR complex [ 12 , 13 ] . CED - 10 : : GFP membrane enrichment was reduced in sax - 3 null mutants , and appeared increased and disorganized in unc - 40 and vab - 1 null mutants . Loss of unc - 40 or vab - 1 resulted in ectopic CED - 10 : : GFP at apical membranes ( Figure 4A ) . Double labeling of CED - 10 : : GFP and the basolateral marker UNC - 70 / beta spectrin showed that in sax - 3 embryos less CED - 10 : : GFP localizes to basolateral regions of these epidermal cells , while in unc - 40 and vab - 1 embryos relatively more CED - 10 : : GFP appears enriched at the basolateral regions . These results suggested that the guidance molecules regulate the subcellular distribution of CED - 10 . To test if the axonal receptors also affect the total levels of CED - 10 , we made whole worm lysates ( Materials and Methods ) from the CED - 10 : : GFP strain carrying null mutations in unc - 40 , sax - 3 or vab - 1 and probed western blots with an antibody to GFP . Loss of the three guidance molecules , especially sax - 3 , reduced total CED - 10 : : GFP levels ( Figure 4C ) . Genetic interactions between receptor mutants and CED - 10 : : GFP . The integrated , rescuing CED - 10 : : GFP strain was made from an extrachromosomal array , thus is likely to contain multiple copies of the wild type ced - 10 gene . This strain on its own has some Full Gex lethality , suggesting too much wild type CED - 10 interferes with morphogenesis . Increasing any Rho GTPase can saturate the cellular machinery that regulates the balance of Rho , Rac and CDC42 [ 36 , 37 ] . Extra copies of CED - 10 may saturate molecules like RHI - 1 / RHOGDI ( Rho guanine nucleo - tide dissociation inhibitor ) , and thus be deleterious by interfering with the other GTPases in the cell . To test if additional CED - 10 causes lethality we compared the progeny of animals that were homozygous or heterozygous for the integrated CED - 10 : : GFP transgene and found that the embryonic lethality was dose dependent : embryonic lethality was twice as high in the progeny of homozygotes vs . heterozygotes ( Figure 4D ) . We therefore asked how the integrated homozygous GFP : : CED - 10 array affected animals that were also missing unc - 40 , sax - 3 or vab - 1 . CED - 10 : : GFP significantly increased the Full Gex phenotype in unc - 40 ( n324 ) and increased the Partial Gex lethality in vab - 1 ( dx31 ) . CED - 10 : : GFP significantly decreased the overall embryonic lethality and the percent of embryos with the Partial Gex phenotype in sax - 3 ( ky123 ) animals ( Figure 4D ) . This result suggested additional copies of CED - 10 can rescue some sax - 3 defects , while worsening unc - 40 and vab - 1 defects . Guidance receptors affect subcellular distribution and levels of WVE - 1 Effects of receptor mutants on GFP : : WVE - 1 . Since the signaling molecules appeared to regulate CED - 10 subcellular localization ( Figure 4 ) and since CED - 10 regulates WAVE levels and localization ( Figure 5 ) , we next wanted to examine how the signaling molecules affected WAVE . To monitor the effect of the candidate upstream signals on the WAVE complex we generated a GFP - tagged WVE - 1 transgene that rescues putative null mutations in wve - 1 and integrated it into the genome using UV - TMP [ 38 ] . In wild - type embryos this transgene shows enriched GFP : : WVE - 1 at regions of cell - cell contact , including the basolateral epidermis [ 12 ] ( Figure 5A , 5B ) . When the rescuing GFP : : WVE - 1 transgene ( pjIs1 ) was crossed into animals with null mutations in unc - 40 , sax - 3 or vab - 1 , all three led to reduced accumulation of GFP : : WVE - 1 at the basolateral epidermis . This altered accumulation was seen in embryos doubly labeled for GFP : : WVE - 1 , using an anti - GFP Rabbit antibody , and ( , 290 min . ) are shown . V = Ventral , bottom . D = Dorsal , top .

The effect on basolateral GFP : : WVE - 1 enrichment by loss of the signaling molecules was similar to that caused by loss of ced - 10 ( n1993 ) . These results suggested two possible effects of the guidance receptors on WVE - 1 : changes in the overall levels and changes in the subcellular localization .

We show the results for whole worm lysates ( Materials and Methods ) , which include WVE - 1 found in pellets and supernatants , since the fractionation studies ( Figure 5D ) revealed dramatic shifts in WVE - 1 when the upstream signals are removed . Control lysates in which wve - 1 was depleted by RNAi resulted in approximately 90 % loss in the levels of WVE - 1 . Lysates missing UNC - 40 showed increased total levels of WVE - 1 . Lysates missing SAX - 3 or VAB - 1 showed a decrease in the overall level of WVE - 1 ( Figure 5C ) . These results showed that in agreement with the results from live imaging with a rescuing GFP : : WVE - 1 transgene , loss of SAX - 3 or VAB - 1 resulted in decreased levels of WVE - 1 protein . Effects of receptor mutants on membrane localization of WVE - 1 . To test if the altered distribution of WVE - 1 resulted from a shift of WVE - 1 enrichment in membranes or cytoplasm , we used control lysates and lysates made from animals carrying null mutations in unc - 40 , sax - 3 and vab - 1 to perform subcellular fractionations . Loss of unc - 40 , like the prenylation - defective ced - 10 ( n1993 ) lysates , resulted in a dramatic increase in the amount of WVE - 1 in the low speed , P1 pellet ( 62 % ) , at the expense of other pellets and supernatant fractions ( Figure 5D ) . This result suggests that loss of UNC - 40 leads to more WVE - 1 enrichment at membranes and organelles enriched in the P1 pellet . Loss of SAX - 3 or VAB - 1 did not significantly affect WVE - 1 distribution in the low speed P1 pellet . The strongest effect observed was decreased WVE - 1 in the high speed P3 and P4 fractions and a shift into supernatant fractions ( Figure 5D ) . We previously showed that P4 is enriched for transmembrane proteins of the recycling endosome while S4 is enriched for membrane - associated proteins of the recycling endosome [ 34 ] . Therefore the loss of SAX - 3 and VAB - 1 may influence WVE - 1 distribution at recycling endosomes or other endosomal fractions . Loss of SAX - 3 or VAB - 1 disrupts WVE - 1 association with multiple membranes . In summary , the three pathways differentially regulate the overall levels of WVE - 1 ( Figure 5C ) , while all three pathways affect the subcellular distribution of WVE - 1 ( Figure 5A , 5B , 5D ) . The consequences of this regulation can be appreciated by in vivo imaging , which reveals reduced basolateral WVE - 1 enrichment in epidermal cells undergoing morphogenesis ( Figure 5B ) . In sax - 3 mutants this reduced membrane enrichment is coupled to decreased levels of WVE - 1 . The lower levels of WAVE / SCAR measured in sax - 3 embryos may contribute to the lower ventral F - actin levels in these embryos ( Figure 2C ) . In unc - 40 mutants , WVE - 1 membrane levels increase , but WVE - 1 may not be properly polarized to basolateral regions as it appears more uniformly distributed ( Figure 5B ) . In vab - 1 mutants levels of WVE - 1 decrease and more WVE - 1 is released from membranes ( Figure 5B , 5D ) . Post - embryonic genetic interactions of WAVE / SCAR genes and axonal guidance genes during neuronal migrations To explore how the three guidance pathways might signal to WAVE / SCAR during post - embryonic neuronal cell migrations , we took advantage of gain - of - function alleles in each guidance receptor . These alleles have been used to ask if other genes are genetically downstream of these guidance signals in neurons . CED - 10 / Rac1 has been placed genetically downstream of UNC - 40 and of SLT - 1 / SAX - 3 due to the ability of loss - of - function mutations in ced - 10 / Rac1 to partially suppress gain - of - function mutations in SLT - 1 and UNC - 40 that alter the post - embryonic migrations of axons labeled with mec - 4 : : gfp ( zdIs5 ) [ 16 , 39 ] . Further , similar gain - of - function studies of VAB - 1 / Eph using myristoylated VAB - 1 have been used to identify genes , including NCK - 1 and Wasp , that function downstream of VAB - 1 [ 40 ] . We used these same strains to ask if WAVE / SCAR behaves like a component of the netrin , Robo or ephrin pathway during post - embryonic neuronal migrations . WAVE / SCAR complex mutants affect axonal guidance of the AVM neuron . We first characterized the effects of WAVE / SCAR loss on the mechanosensory neuron reporter , mec - 4 : : gfp [ 41 ] , focusing on the well - characterized migration of the axon of the AVM motor neuron . In wild type animals carrying this transgene the AVM cell body is relatively round , it does not make extra projections , and it has one axon that migrates ventrally to the nerve cord and then anteriorly towards the head . 12 % of the animals show minor perturbations in the ventral migration . Depletion of gex - 2 or gex - 3 via RNAi led to frequent defects in the ventralward migration of the axon ( 20 – 34 % , compared to 12 % , Figure 6A ) . In contrast , depletion of gex - 2 or gex - 3 did not result in significant effects on cell body shape and only occasionally caused ectopic projections ( 1 % ) ( Figure 6C ) . Animals with a transgene containing myristoylated UNC - 40 : : GFP ( iqIs131 ) , a proposed gain - of - function strain , display a 43 % penetrant defect in the ventral migration of AVM , 8 % have AVM cell body abnormalities and 18 % have ectopic projections . Depletion of gex - 2 or gex - 3 via RNAi did not suppress these phenotypes . Instead , the ventral guidance defect was enhanced to 69 % , suggesting an additive effect . Myristoylated VAB - 1 : : GFP , a proposed gain - of - function trans - gene ( quIs5 ) , leads to a 39 % penetrant defect in the ventral migration of AVM , as well as 40 % penetrant defect in cell body abnormalities and 36 % penetrance of ectopic projections . Depletion of gex - 2 or gex - 3 via RNAi did not suppress these phenotypes . Therefore , Myr - VAB - 1 : : GFP may not require WAVE / SCAR for the aberrant AVM behaviors . Expression of SLT - 1 under the myo - 3 promoter ( kyIs218 ) results in SLT - 1 signal from both dorsal and ventral muscle cells , rather than just dorsal cells , which leads to SAX - 3 activation from both ventral and dorsal regions . This slt - 1 / sax - 3 gain - of - function results in a 53 % penetrant defect in the ventral migration of AVM , with 2 % cell body abnormalities and 7 % ectopic projections . Depletion of gex - 2 or gex - 3 via RNAi led to partial suppression of the ventral migration defects , ( to 36 % ) suggesting that SLT - 1 and SAX - 3 / Robo may signal through WAVE / SCAR . Discussion Our results suggest that the ventralward enrichment of F - actin is an essential event that sets up properly organized and dynamic actin protrusions that result in cell migrations during C . elegans morphogenesis . Models of WAVE / SCAR activation propose that receptor signaling leads to activated Rac ( Rac - GTP ) that can WVE - 1 . Lysates were spun at increasing speeds and duration .

Thus , Rac activation helps recruit the WAVE / SCAR complex to membranes where it can promote cellular protrusions or other Arp2 / 3 - dependent events [ 29 ] . We show here that three signaling pathways regulate the actin cytoskeleton during embryonic development through differential effects on the actin regulators CED - 10 / Rac1 and WAVE - 1 . These studies suggest how multiple signals that assemble at cell membranes are combined to induce the polarized distribution of molecules that promote polarized distribution of F - actin . Why had netrin effects on embryonic morphogenesis been missed ? While the ephrin and slit / robo pathways had long been examined for embryonic morphogenesis effects , there was little notice of netrin embryonic roles . The one exception is the 1990 netrin pathway paper by Hedgecock and colleagues that reported embryonic neuronal and mesodermal cell migration defects [ 1 ] . We observed that all four unc - 40 putative null alleles and the unc - 6 deletion null showed low penetrance embryonic lethality , and a small but significant number of embryos with the Full Gex phenotype ( no enclosure ) . This was true after we out - crossed four putative null unc - 40 mutants and the unc - 6 deletion null strain twice . Therefore it is highly unlikely that secondary mutations or strain background can explain the unc - 40 and unc - 6 embryonic phenotypes . Guidance receptors regulate embryonic F - actin dynamics The distribution of F - actin in the migrating epidermal cells is highly dynamic and enriched toward the leading edge . We previously showed that loss of the WAVE complex leads to fewer , smaller protrusions at the leading edge of the migrating epidermal cells [ 15 ] . The movies made for this study show waves of F - actin enrichment that are dynamically oriented toward the leading edge ( Video S1 and S2 ) . In vivo imaging of F - actin distribution in embryos missing either the netrin , Robo or ephrin receptors demonstrated quantifiable changes in epidermal F - actin levels and enrichment . When the epidermal cells initiate their migrations , robust filopodial and lamellar protrusions extend from the two Leading Cells at the anterior epidermis . Loss of sax - 3 or vab - 1 caused a significant delay in Leading Cell protrusions that correlated with a drop in ventralward enrichment of F - actin ( Figure 2A , 2E ) . These changes in F - actin distribution help explain the high percent of embryonic lethality seen in sax - 3 and vab - 1 embryos . In contrast , loss of unc - 40 permitted ventral protrusions in all embryos examined , and ventralward enrichment of F - actin , despite a drop in overall F - actin levels . This helps explain the much milder embryonic lethality seen in unc - 40 and unc - 6 mutant embryos and suggests F - actin polarization or enrichment is more important for cell migration than total F - actin levels . Removal of any of the guidance cues analyzed here altered the rate of protrusion turnover ( Figure 3 , Video S3 ) . Some actin regulators , like cofilin , are involved in the turnover of protrusions by helping to disassemble polymerized actin , and thus contribute to the recycling of actin components that promotes cell movements [ 42 , 43 ] . Other actin regulators , like myosin II and Rho , help turn over protrusions by helping to remodel adhesive structures [ 44 ] . Turnover of protrusions is thus an essential component of cell migrations . We propose that axonal guidance cues may contribute to all of these kinds of actin changes that promote cell migrations including protrusion formation and turnover . More thorough understanding of how changes at the membrane result in dramatic changes in the F - actin levels and enrichment shown here will require additional studies . However , our identification of CED - 10 and WVE - 1 as essential read - outs of the signals is an important first step in understanding this complicated process . Model for the regulation of CED - 10 / Rac1 and WAVE / SCAR by the three guidance cues Loss of unc - 40 , sax - 3 and vab - 1 altered the distribution and levels of CED - 10 : : GFP and GFP : : WVE - 1 at subcellular regions . To understand how three distinct pathways could contribute to the correct regulation of cell movements that depend on actin regulators , we tested the model that all the pathways act redundantly . Genetic and molecular studies show that a simple redundancy model does not explain the integration of three signals to regulate the WAVE / SCAR actin nucleation complex . Instead , our results suggest the following Model for the roles of the three signaling pathways ( Figure 7 ) . We propose that UNC - 40 activity supports the transport of inactive CED - 10 / Rac1 ( Rac - GDP , grey circles in Figure 7 ) to endosomes where it is activated ( Rac - GTP , red circles , Figure 7 ) . Activated CED - 10 / Rac1 is then targeted to the plasma membrane where it is recruited by SAX - 3 / Robo . Activated CED - 10 / Rac1 can then recruit and help assemble the WAVE / SCAR complex , which leads to robust branched actin polymerization through the Arp2 / 3 complex . VAB - 1 / Ephrin inhibits the targeting of activated CED - 10 / Rac to the membrane thereby modulating branched actin polymerization . Model for SAX - 3 / Robo recruitment of CED - 10 / Rac1 to promote embryonic morphogenesis . SLT - 1 / Robo signaling requires Rac downstream [ 22 , 23 ] . The results shown here suggest a relatively simple relationship between SAX - 3 / Robo and CED - 10 / Rac1 during epidermal morphogenesis in C . elegans . SAX - 3 / Robo signaling helps to recruit CED - 10 / Rac1 to the membrane , which recruits the WAVE complex , and results in polarized nucleation of F - actin at the leading edge required for epidermal migrations . Model for UNC - 40 / DCC activation of CED - 10 / Rac1 during embryonic morphogenesis . Netrin / DCC signaling has been shown to activate Rac1 in vitro [ 17 – 19 ] while genetic studies support a role for CED - 10 / Rac1 downstream of UNC - 40 / DCC [ 16 ] . We propose that the wild type function of UNC - 40 is to promote CED - 10 activation . Loss of UNC - 40 / DCC resulted in altered CED - 10 and WVE - 1 distribution , and decreased F - actin levels . Subcellular fractionation showed that while overall WVE - 1 levels were slightly elevated , WVE - 1 became highly enriched in the low speed pellet , suggesting a shift of WVE - 1 to new membrane locations . In addition , CED - 10 appeared more enriched basolaterally ( Figure 4B ) , while WVE - 1 was less enriched basolaterally ( Figure 5B ) . We interpret this to mean that in unc - 40 mutants CED - 10 at this apparent basolateral location is less capable of recruiting WVE - 1 appropriately . Palamidessi and colleagues found that Rac1 requires trafficking to endosomes to become active at the membrane [ 45 ] . We propose that UNC - 40 is involved in activating CED - 10 / Rac1 by ensuring it is appropri - ately trafficked to the correct endosomes . Localization studies with antibodies to active and inactive C . elegans CED - 10 / Rac1 , which ( lqIs131 ) , carry transgenes that cause gain of function phenotypes in three axonal guidance receptors . gof = gain - of - function .

In addition , it may be possible to use antibodies to activated mammalian Rac1 to immunoprecipitate active CED - 10 in wild type lysates and in lysates depleted of UNC - 40 to test this model . Netrin effects on morphogenesis are quite mild ( Figure 1 , Table 1 ) , in spite of the changes in CED - 10 and WVE - 1 localization ( Figure 4 , Figure 5 ) , and decreased F - actin levels ( Figure 2 ) . The mildness might be explained by partial redundancy with other signaling pathways including SAX - 3 / Robo . The unc - 40 ; sax - 3 double showed a synergistic increase in the Full Gex morphogenesis phenotype which could indicate redundancy . In the absence of UNC - 40 , SAX - 3 continues to recruit ( and possibly activate ) CED - 10 at the membrane , even without UNC - 40 activation of CED - 10 ( Figure 1C , Table 1 ) . An alternative way to explain the mild netrin phenotypes is that the higher amounts of CED - 10 at membranes induced by unc - 40 loss , even if not fully polarized , result in enough CED - 10 and WVE - 1 activity that is able to assemble polarized F - actin to promote ventral protrusions . Model for VAB - 1 / Ephrin Receptor modulation of CED - 10 / Rac1 to promote embryonic morphogenesis . In vab - 1 mutants CED - 10 appears more enriched at basolateral regions ( Figure 4B ) , but WVE - 1 appears less enriched at basolateral regions ( Figure 5B ) . Subcellular fractionations show decreased WVE - 1 in the higher speed pellets , suggesting a shift of WVE - 1 away from some membranes . This results in high but disorganized F - actin levels ( Figure 2 ) . These results are distinct from the changes seen in sax - 3 or unc - 40 mutants . In neurons , activated ephrin receptor is proposed to negatively regulate Rac1 [ 15 ] . Given the role of ephrins in membrane and cytoskeletal remodeling during synaptic transmission , one attractive possibility is that ephrin signaling regulates the abundance of guidance receptors at the membrane that is required for F - actin reorganization in the epidermis . Since more F - actin is nucleated in vab - 1 mutants , and protrusion turnover is delayed ( Figure 3 ) one potential role for VAB - 1 is to negatively regulate CED - 10 activation or localization . If the turnover of CED - 10 and its associated receptors decreases at the membrane , this could contribute to the results we see : ectopic F - actin polymerization in less dynamic cells , decreased ventral - ward enrichment of F - actin , and delays in cell migration . Similar experiments to those proposed for testing the role of UNC - 40 could test the model that there is extra CED - 10 activation , but at the wrong place , in vab - 1 mutants . Alternatively , the increased F - actin seen in vab - 1 mutants may be due to up - regulation of another pathway that promotes actin nucleation when VAB - 1 is missing . For example , VAB - 1 has a mutually inhibitory interaction with the PIP3 Phosphatase PTEN / DAF - 18 [ 46 ] , and PTEN / DAF - 18 contributes to embryonic development [ 47 ] . Where does VAB - 1 act during embryonic epidermal cell migrations ? VAB - 2 and VAB - 1 , Ephrin and Ephrin receptor , were thought to act in the underlying neuroblasts for epidermal morphogenesis to occur [ 6 – 8 ] . However recent studies of the vab - 1 promoter fused to GFP suggest that some epidermal cells express VAB - 1 [ 48 ] . More fine - tuned analysis of actin dynamics in the epidermal and neuronal cells in animals depleted of ephrin and ephrin receptor could address the tissue requirements of ephrins during this process . Do the interactions shown here extend to neurons ? WAVE / SCAR components have been shown to affect axonal guidance and ectopic branching in the PDE neuron [ 14 ] . Loss of WAVE / SCAR components affected the ventral migration of the AVM axon ( Figure 6A ) , suggesting WAVE / SCAR proteins contribute to some of the same axonal guidance events that are regulated by netrins , slt - 1 / Robo and ephrins . One caveat is that we depleted the WAVE / SCAR components by RNAi in all tissues , so these effects on neurons could also be due to the functions of WAVE / SCAR in other tissues . Tissue - specific depletion of WAVE / SCAR components would clarify this issue . We tested if the role of WAVE / SCAR downstream of axonal guidance receptors extends to neurons by using gain - of - function Figure 7 . Model for the regulation of the CED - 10 / Rac1 – WAVE / SCAR – Arp2 / 3 pathway by axonal guidance receptors . UNC - 40 activity supports the transport of inactive CED - 10 / Rac1 ( Rac1 - GDP , grey circles ) to endosomes where it becomes activated ( Rac1 - GTP , red circles ) . Activated CED - 10 / Rac1 is then targeted to the plasma membrane where it is recruited by SAX - 3 / Robo . Activated CED - 10 / Rac1 can then recruit and help assemble the WAVE / SCAR complex ( blue ovals ) , which leads to robust branched actin polymerization through the Arp2 / 3 complex ( yellow oval ) . VAB - 1 / Ephrin inhibits the targeting of activated CED - 10 / Rac to the membrane thereby modulating branched actin polymerization . doi : 10 . 1371 / journal . pgen . 1002863 . g007 Axonal Cues Polarize F - Actin through WAVE / SCAR PLoS Genetics | www . plosgenetics . org 14 August 2012 | Volume 8 | Issue 8 | e1002863 strains that alter the AVM axonal migration ( Figure 6 ) . The ability of WAVE / SCAR and Arp2 / 3 depletion to suppress the slt - 1 / sax - 3 gain - of - function defects may support our Model that SLT - 1 / Robo can signal through Rac , and that Rac activates WAVE / SCAR . The inability of WAVE / SCAR to suppress the Myr - VAB - 1 gain - of - function defects suggests that Ephrin in C . elegans has targets other than WAVE / SCAR . For example , it has been suggested that VAB - 1 signals through Wasp and NCK - 1 [ 40 ] . The inability of WAVE / SCAR depletion to suppress Myr - UNC - 40 phenotypes was a surprise , given the expectation that UNC - 40 activates Rac , which can activate WAVE / SCAR . There are several ways to interpret this result . Myr - UNC - 40 : : GFP may alter other cytoskel - etal components other than the WAVE / SCAR complex to interfere with the correct AVM axon migration . Another possibility is that Myr - UNC - 40 , which is retained at the membrane , may not be simply more active . If the failure of Myr - UNC - 40 to turn over , or to interact with other UNC - 40 Receptors blocks a positive cue , then Myr - UNC - 40 may be causing a loss - of - function phenotype . In relation to our proposed model , if UNC - 40 activation of CED - 10 / Rac1 supports SAX - 3 recruitment of active CED - 10 / Rac1 , then UNC - 40 loss would enhance defects caused by loss of WVE components , just like it enhances loss of SAX - 3 . An alternative interpretation is that in the absence of WAVE / SCAR in all tissues ( as we did here ) other axonal molecules , like SLT - 1 , are not properly localized . This could lead to enhancement of the Myr : : UNC - 40 defects . Future experiments with reagents that can show how loss of one signal affects the other signals will be helpful in further determining how these multiple signals converge to regulate CED - 10 / Rac1 enrichment at membranes , WAVE / SCAR re - cruitment and activation , and properly polarized and dynamic F - actin .

Lysates for biochemistry Whole - worm lysates . ( Figure 4C , Figure 5C ) To look at the change in total levels of proteins , small scale lysates were prepared by boiling 100 adult worms in 40 m l of RIPA buffer ( 15 mM HEPES , 140 mM NaCl , 3 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 % Sodium Deoxycholate , 1 % NP - 40 , 2 % SDS ) with 20 m l 5 6 Laemmli sample buffer . These lysates contain both supernatant and pellet components and are therefore termed whole worm lysates . 15 ul of each lysate ( equivalent to approximately 25 worms ) were loaded on a 10 % SDS - PAGE gel . Embryonic lysates . ( Figure 5C ) were prepared as in [ 12 ] : Briefly , large populations of worms were collected and the adults were dissolved using a hypochlorite solution to collect the embryos . Embryos were homogenized in Lysis Buffer ( 150 mM NaCl , 1 mM DTT , 0 . 1 % Triton and protease inhibitor cocktail - Roche # 11836153001 ) in a stainless steel homogenizer ( Wheaton # 357572 ) . Lysates were spun at 5 K for 5 minutes to separate the supernatant from the pellet . The pellet fraction was resuspended in 100 ul of Lysis Buffer . Both supernatant and pellet were diluted to a concentration of 1 ug / ml and 10 ug in total were loaded on an SDS - PAGE gel . Subcellular fractionations Lysates were prepared as described for embryonic lysates above but mixed staged animals were used and Triton was excluded from the Lysis buffer . All lysates were processed immediately . The lysates were spun at increasing speeds and times using a Beckman Coulter Optima TLX Ultracentrifuge , rotor # TLA - 120 . 2 . The supernatant was removed after each spin and spun at the next speed . The spin speeds and times were : spin 1 , 1 K rpm for 10 minutes ; spin 2 , 10 K rpm for 10 minutes ; spin 3 , 30 K for 20 minutes ; spin 4 , 100 K for 90 minutes . At each step the pellet was resuspended in a volume equal to the supernatant it was derived from . 5 6 Laemmli Buffer was then added to each fraction , the fractions were boiled at 95 u C for 5 minutes before loading on gels for Western blotting . Equal volumes of each supernatant and pellet pair were loaded per lane . Feeding RNAi For all feeding RNAi , cDNAs of the genes were inserted into L4440 vector and transformed into HT115 cells . Saturated overnight cultures were diluted 1 : 250 and incubated for 6 – 7 h at 37 u C with agitation until the OD600 was close to 1 . Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in LB Amp , 100 m g / ml . 1 mM IPTG was added to the bacteria and Amp plates before use . C . elegans animals were synchronized by hypochlorite treatment followed by hatching in M9 Buffer . For lysates L1 worms were fed either control HT115 E . Coli , or HT115 containing the L4440 plasmid carrying the gene of interest and were grown at 20 u C for 3 days . Lysates were made from the mixed population of adults and eggs . For embryonic analysis embryos were collected on the third day and imaged . For adult analysis , animals were assayed for neuronal phenotypes after two days on the RNAi food . All experiments were performed at 20 u C unless otherwise noted . Immunostaining and microscopy of embryos For immunohistochemistry , embryos were fixed to poly - lysine slides and freeze - cracked by incubating on dry ice for 15 minutes . Slides were then fixed in methanol for 20 minutes at 2 20 u C , blocked in 2 % PBST for 5 minutes , washed 3 times with PBS and incubated with primary antibodies for 1 hour at 37 u C . Slides were then washed 3 times with PBS and incubated with secondary fluorophore conjugated antibodies for 1 hour at 37 u C . Slides were mounted in PGND solution as described . All images ( except live imaging of plin - 26 : : vab - 10 ABD : : gfp , Figure 2 , Figure 3 ) were acquired on a Zeiss Axioskop 2 Plus microscope using a 40 6 oil Axonal Cues Polarize F - Actin through WAVE / SCAR PLoS Genetics | www . plosgenetics . org 15 August 2012 | Volume 8 | Issue 8 | e1002863 objective with iVision 4 . 0 software driving a Roper SensiCam QE camera . The images were then analyzed using ImageJ software . Live imaging of embryos Two to four cell stage embryos ( 0 – 20 minutes after first cleavage ) were dissected from adult hermaphrodites and mounted on 3 % agarose pads in water . The embryos were incubated at 23 u C for 240 minutes , then imaged every 2 minutes for at least 120 minutes . The interval was chosen to reduce photo bleaching of the signal and to avoid damage to the embryo due to the exposure to UV light . Laser spinning disc confocal microcopy Live plin - 26 : : vab - 10 ABD : : gfp embryos were imaged using a 40 6 1 . 3 NA oil immersion lens on a Nikon TE2000 inverted microscope fitted with a Yokogawa CSU21 spinning - disk confocal scanhead ( Perkin Elmer ) , a Melles - Griot argon laser ( 514 nm excitation ) controlled by a Neos programmable AOTF . Multidi - mensional datasets were acquired using the software MetaMorph on a Hamamatsu Orca - AG cooled CCD camera , and stereo QuickTimeVR movies were assembled from the raw data using a custom - written plug - in for the Java program ImageJ ( http : / / rsb . info . nih . gov / ij / ) . Background noise from the camera was reduced to the lowest grey levels of the image bit depth , via a linear contrast stretch . Images taken at the time points of interest were analyzed using ImageJ software or the ImageJ - based GLOWormJ viewing and analysis program : http : / / www . glowormnotes . org . Quantitation of epidermal F - actin Embryos expressing plin26 : : vab10ActinBindingDomain : : gfp were filmed at 2 - minute intervals . Stacks were projected into 4D QuickTime movies that allowed viewing of the embryos from multiple angles . All quantitation was done on the raw images . The figure legends indicate when images were enhanced for contrast , and the same enhancement was applied to a mosaic of the related images for that figure . Figure 2C . To quantitate total levels of F - actin at the leading edge movies of live embryos were opened in the GLOWormJ program , which uses the ImageJ platform . Timing : measurements were done at the time of first F - actin enrichment at the leading edge of the Leading Cells ( LCs ) . For wild type embryos this was , 260 minutes after first cleavage . For gex - 3 , where actin is never recruited to the leading edge the measurements were taken at , 260 minutes to match the wild type . For unc - 40 , unc - 6 , sax - 3 , and vab - 1 the measurements were taken at , 270 , , 260 , , 275 and , 270 minutes after first cleavage respectively . Region measured : the rectangle tool was used to draw a box , 36 by 36 pixels , that covered approximately a third of the length of the cell from the leading edge . A single reading of average fluorescence was taken for each embryo at the stated time point . The readings were then averaged and a One - way ANOVA test was used to test for significant changes in fluorescence levels . n for each genotype is shown in Figure 2C . Figure 2D . To measure the distribution of F - actin in the LCs of the migrating epidermis along the dorsal / ventral axis , movies were analyzed using the GLOWormJ program . A single line was drawn through one of the LCs from the ventral to the dorsal side using the Line tool , and the intensity of the fluorescent signal was read along this line , and plotted . Areas of the cell with the highest fluorescent signal produced high readings , at least 10 fluorescent units higher than the background , which appeared as peaks on the plotted graph and were marked with an asterisk . Readings were taken for 20 frames , starting with the time point when actin was first enriched at the leading edge of the LCs , as described for Figure 2C . The distribution of the peaks on the graph was examined , either in the ventral half or in the dorsal half of the cell . Figure 2D shows one representative graph from the 20 that were generated per embryo examined . Figure 2E . The number of peaks observed either in the ventral half or in the dorsal half were counted for 20 frames ( 40 minutes ) during which the readings were taken . The total number of ventral peaks was divided by the total number of dorsal peaks for the 20 frames . This generated the ratio of ventral to dorsal actin enrichment . n for each genotype is shown in Figure 2E . Statistical analysis All graphs show the mean of the data and the Standard Error of the Mean ( SEM ) . For grouped data , statistical significance was established by performing a two - way Analysis of Variance ( ANOVA ) followed by the Bonferroni multiple comparison post - test . For ungrouped data a one - way ANOVA was performed followed by the Tukey post - test . Asterisks ( * ) denote p values , 0 . 05 . All statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism .
