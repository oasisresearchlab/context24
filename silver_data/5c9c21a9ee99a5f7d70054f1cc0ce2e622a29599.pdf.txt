We reported IgG antibody 30 development status against Nucleocapsid protein of the virus and compared with lifestyle 31 ( health and food habits ) , co - existing diseases , vaccination and COVID - 19 infection status . 32 ELISA ( Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay ) was performed to assess IgG antibodies 33 targeted against the Nucleocapsid protein of SARS - CoV - 2 in participants ( n = 500 ) . In this 34 seroprevalence study , serological data were estimated for a period of 10 months in the 35 participants who were aged 10 years and above . Sociodemographic and risk factors related 36 data were collected through a written questionnaire and chi - square test was performed to 37 determine the association with seropositivity . The overall seroprevalence of anti - SARS - CoV - 38 2 antibodies among the study subjects was 47 . 8 % . Estimates were highest among the 39 participants of 21 - 40 years old ( 55 . 1 % ) , and lowest in older aged ( > 60 years ) participants 40 ( 39 . 5 % ) . Among the Sinopharm vaccinated individuals 81 . 8 % had developed anti - 41 Nucleocapsid antibody . Physical exercise and existence of comorbidities like hypertension 3 42 and diabetes were the distinguishing factors between seropositive and seronegative 43 individuals . Seropositivity rate largely varied among symptomatic ( 67 % ) and asymptomatic 44 ( 33 . 1 % ) COVID - 19 infected participants . The findings suggest that residents of Dhaka city 45 had a higher prevalence of anti - nucleocapsid antibody in the second year of the pandemic . 46 This indicates the improvement of immunological status among the population . Finally , the 47 study emphasizes on maintaining active and healthy lifestyle to improve immunity . However , 48 the absence of IgG antibodies in many cases of COVID - 19 infected individuals suggests that 49 antibodies wane with time . 50 Keywords : 51 Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 Antibody , IgG , Nucleocapsid protein , Seroprevalence 52 Introduction 53 The extremely infectious Coronavirus Disease - 2019 ( COVID - 19 ) was originally discovered 54 in Wuhan , Hubei Province , China , caused by the new RNA virus SARS - CoV - 2 [ 1 ] . Within 55 three months of the outbreak , the virus had spreaded all over the world and was declared a 56 pandemic by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) in March 2020 . Bangladesh , with its 57 inadequate medical facilities and dense population , remains one of the most vulnerable 58 countries throughout the epidemic [ 2 ] . COVID - 19 was initially confirmed in Bangladesh on 59 March 8 , 2020 . Until 27 March 2022 , a total number of 1 . 95 million people have been 60 infected and 96 . 67 million people have received two doses of vaccine [ 3 ] . 61 Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction ( RT - PCR ) diagnoses viral RNA in symptomatic 62 patients to monitor SARS - CoV - 2 infection in individuals . Cases that are mildly symptomatic 63 or asymptomatic often are excluded from reports . As a result , true SARS - CoV - 2 infection 64 rates differ from reported cases [ 4 ] . Serological tests are necessary to identify all infected 4 65 persons , regardless of clinical symptoms to undertake surveillance and limit the viral spread 66 [ 5 ] . 67 When infected with SARS - COV - 2 , the virus triggers a humoral immune response that results 68 in the production of antibodies against Spike glycoprotein ( S ) and Nucleocapsid protein ( N ) 69 within the first 7 days after onset of symptoms [ 5 - 9 ] . IgG and IgM antibody development in 70 SARS - CoV - 2 infection occurs concurrently or sequentially which differs from classical 71 infection dynamics where IgM is expected to appear first and IgG is detected in delayed time 72 [ 6 ] . Long - term immunity , however , necessitates the formation of IgG [ 10 ] . The speed of viral 73 clearance is determined by the dynamics of the humoral immune response . Rapid viral 74 clearance is linked to earlier antibody responses since low initial SARS - CoV - 2 RNA was 75 found in individuals who lack serum IgG . This report by Masiá et al . , ( 2021 ) suggested that 76 the intensity of viral replication influences the production of adaptive humoral responses . The 77 distribution and variance of antibody dynamics are considered to be linked to age , gender , co - 78 existing disease , viral load , and other parameters that influence disease severity [ 12 ] . 79 Antibody responses to pathogens in serum or plasma are measured using serological tests . 80 Different methods , including as ELISA , lateral flow assays , and Western Blot assays , are 81 used to perform serological tests . These assays are useful for determining protective antibody 82 titers in the event of infection or immunization [ 13 ] . Reinfection or illness severity is linked 83 to decreasing antibody levels against SARS - CoV - 2 [ 14 ] . It is important to determine the 84 underlying cause behind seronegative individuals with a history of infection . Over a 10 - 85 month period , we investigated antibody production against the Nucleocapsid protein of 86 SARS - CoV - 2 in 500 people and correlated seropositivity with numerous risk factors . 87 Antibodies against the nucleocapsid protein are mostly observed in persons after they had 88 been infected with the virus and have been vaccinated with vaccines that use the virus in its 89 whole attenuated form [ 15 ] . We surveyed the individuals on their lifestyles , food habits , 5 90 COVID - 19 infection status and comorbidities , and then compared them to their IgG antibody 91 development . 92 Methods 93 Study Subjects : 94 The research was carried out at the Institute of Technology Transfer and Innovation , 95 Bangladesh Council of Scientific and Industrial Research in Dhanmondi , Dhaka . A total of 96 500 study subjects participated in the study who was mostly residents of Dhaka city . A 97 standardized questionnaire was given to each participant which asked about socio - 98 demographic characteristics , lifestyle , dietary and healthy habits , existing co - morbidities , 99 COVID - 19 infection status and vaccination status . Before registering for the survey , the 100 participants had to provide verbal and written consent . 101 Sample collection : 102 The experiment was performed using fresh serum . Freshly collected peripheral venous blood 103 of 3 ml was drawn from each participant and kept in a clot activator blood collection tube . 104 After 5 - 10 minutes , clot formed in the blood and the tubes were centrifuged at 2 , 000 rpm for 105 8 minutes . Serum was collected in Eppendorf from the upper aqueous portion of centrifuged 106 blood . 107 Laboratory analysis : 108 Anti - SARS - CoV - 2 - N - IgG was measured in the lab using a commercially available ELISA kit 109 named ID Screen SARS - CoV - 2 - N IgG Indirect by Innovative Diagnostics that targets the 110 virus ' s Nucleocapsid protein . According to the test protocol , 1 : 20 diluted serum was used in 111 the experiment . The ELISA plate from the commercial kit was coated with Nucleocapsid 6 112 antigen of the virus to which only specific antibody present in the serum bound . The final 113 optical density was determined by Multiskan ELISA plate reader . 114 Statistical analysis : 115 SPSS software version 21 was used for all statistical analyses . The Chi - square test was 116 performed to examine the association between seropositivity and risk factors ( age , sex , 117 profession and lifestyle ) . Variables with a p - value of less than 0 . 05 were considered 118 statistically significant . 119 Results : 120 Among the participants , 158 ( 68 . 4 % ) were male and rest were female ( 31 . 6 % ) . 11 ( 2 . 2 % ) of 121 the participants were of age 10 to 20 years , 225 ( 45 % ) were of age 21 - 40 years , 229 ( 45 . 8 % ) 122 were of 41 - 60 years and 35 ( 7 % ) were above 60 years old . Among the participants , 142 123 ( 28 . 4 % ) were health professionals , 20 ( 4 % ) were engineers , 19 ( 3 . 8 % ) were teachers , 26 124 ( 5 . 2 % ) were businessmen , 73 ( 14 . 6 % ) were scientists and rest 220 ( 44 % ) were of other 125 professions that included government and private service holders , bankers , homemakers , 126 students etc . 127 Demographics of the study participants 128 The socio - demographic characteristics of the participants are presented in Table 1 . This data 129 represents that the study subjects were mainly working - class people who had to go outside 130 the house during pandemic . The highest prevalence of antibody ( 55 . 1 % ) was among the age 131 group of 21 - 40 years . Out of the 43 individuals in the age group above 60 years , 17 132 individuals had developed antibody which was found the lowest prevalence ( 39 . 5 % ) of 133 antibody among all the age groups . Seroprevalence of current smokers ( 35 . 16 % ) was 134 significantly lower than that of never smokers ( 51 . 92 % ) ( P = < 0 . 05 ) . The people who exposed 7 135 to the dust had found highest prevalence ( 57 . 32 % ) of antibody than the people who did not 136 expose to the dust ( 35 . 17 % ) . 137 Table 1 : Seroprevalence of IgG antibody according to Socio - demographic characteristics of 138 the study subjects Variables Categories No . of Positive / No . of Subjects Seroprevalence ( % ) P - value a Male 166 / 342 48 . 5 Gender Female 73 / 158 46 . 2 > 0 . 05 10 - 20 5 / 11 45 . 5 21 - 40 124 / 225 55 . 1 41 - 60 93 / 221 42 . 1 Age Group 61 and above 17 / 43 39 . 5 < 0 . 05 a Health workers 58 / 142 40 . 85 Engineer 6 / 20 30 Teacher 9 / 19 47 . 4 Business 11 / 26 42 . 31 Scientist 35 / 73 47 . 95 Profession b Others 120 / 220 54 . 5 > 0 . 05 Yes 105 / 203 51 . 72 Education No 134 / 297 45 . 11 > 0 . 05 Yes 32 / 91 35 . 16 Smoking c No 189 / 364 51 . 92 < 0 . 05 a Yes 180 / 314 57 . 32 Dust Exposure d No 51 / 145 35 . 17 < 0 . 05 a 139 a P < 0 . 05 was considered to indicate significance 8 140 b Others = Banker , Student , Homemaker , Government Service Holder , Driver 141 c 45 people did not clear their status 142 d 41 people did not clear their status 143 Lifestyle and dietary habits with antibody positivity : 144 In this study , the healthy habits and risk factors of participants were taken into consideration 145 that might be responsible for the persistence of antibody after infection or vaccination . In 146 Table 2 , different habits and risk factors of subjects such as regular walking , regular exercise , 147 dietary habits of consumption of vegetables , fruits , fast foods and vitamin - C had been 148 demonstrated . Significantly higher ( P < 0 . 05 ) seropositivity of 52 . 1 % and 54 . 4 % was found 149 among the participants who had the habit of regular walking and exercising respectively . The 150 dietary habits were not found significantly ( P > 0 . 05 ) correlated with the antibody 151 development . 152 Table 2 : Association of IgG antibody with lifestyle , dietary and healthy habits of the study 153 subjects Risk factors Categories No . of Positive / No . of Subjects Seroprevalence ( % ) P - value a Yes 171 / 328 52 . 1 Regular Walking No 68 / 172 39 . 5 < 0 . 05 e Yes 93 / 171 54 . 4 Regular Exercise No 146 / 329 44 . 4 < 0 . 05 e Yes 223 / 466 47 . 9 Regular Vegetable Intake No 16 / 34 47 . 1 > 0 . 05 Yes 195 / 393 49 . 6 Regular Fruits Intake No 44 / 107 41 . 1 > 0 . 05 9 Yes 40 / 85 47 . 1 Regular Fast Food Intake No 199 / 415 48 > 0 . 05 Yes 193 / 395 48 . 9 Vitamin C Intake No 46 / 105 43 . 8 > 0 . 05 154 a P < 0 . 05 was considered to indicate significance 155 COVID - 19 infection and vaccination status with antibody 156 development : 157 The Covid - 19 infection and vaccination status of the participants has been demonstrated in 158 Table 3 . The study showed that the prevalence of antibody among 162 individuals who tested 159 positive for Covid - 19 was 67 . 9 % . Only 54 ( 37 . 5 % ) individuals were found seropositive 160 among 144 individuals who tested negative for Covid - 19 . Among the undiagnosed 161 individuals 38 . 7 % were found seropositive . 162 The vaccination status of the participants showed that the subjects who received only 1 st dose 163 of vaccine had higher seroprevalence of antibody ( 53 . 03 % ) against Nucleocapsid protein of 164 COVID - 19 compared to that of fully vaccinated ( 46 . 56 % ) individuals and non - vaccinated 165 ( 48 . 25 % ) individuals . 166 In this study , people who received Sinopharm vaccine were found to develop significantly 167 higher ( P < 0 . 05 ) level ( 81 . 8 % ) of antibody whereas significantly lower ( P < 0 . 05 ) level of 168 antibody ( 36 . 6 % ) was found among the individuals vaccinated with AstraZeneca . 169 Significantly higher seropositivity ( 52 . 2 % ) was found among the individuals who did not 170 have history of co - existing diseases like hypertension , diabetes , COPD , liver disease , heart 171 disease , asthma and other diseases . On the other hand , significantly lower seropositivity 172 ( 42 . 3 % ) was observed among the patients who had either one or more co - existing diseases . 10 173 Significantly lower ( P < 0 . 05 ) antibody development was detected in the participants afflicted 174 by Hypertension ( 33 . 6 % ) and Diabetes ( 37 . 2 % ) . 175 176 Table 3 : Seroprevalence according to COVID - 19 infection and Vaccination status Variables Categories No . of Positive / No . of Subjects Seroprevelance ( % ) P - value a Positive 110 / 162 67 . 9 Negative 54 / 144 37 . 5 COVID - 19 Test Status Undiagnosed 75 / 119 38 . 7 < 0 . 05 a Partially Vaccinated 35 / 66 53 . 03 Fully Vaccinated 149 / 320 46 . 56 Vaccination Status Non Vaccinated 55 / 114 48 . 25 > 0 . 05 AstraZeneca 100 / 273 36 . 6 Pfizer 7 / 13 68 . 18 Sinopharm 54 / 86 81 . 8 Name of Vaccine Moderna 15 / 25 60 < 0 . 05 a Yes 94 / 222 42 . 3 Coexisting disease No 145 / 278 52 . 2 < 0 . 05 a Diabetes 35 / 94 37 . 2 Hypertension 38 / 113 33 . 6 Coexisting disease ( Specific ) Other Diseases b 33 / 68 48 . 5 < 0 . 05 a 177 a P < 0 . 05 was considered to indicate significance 178 b COPD , liver disease , heart disease , renal disease , asthma , obesity , malignancy 11 179 Association of seroprevalence with appearance of symptoms on 180 COVID - 19 infection : 181 Seroprevelance in symptomatic and asymptomatic cases had been associated with COVID - 19 182 test status of participants which is demonstrated in Table 4 . The patients who had the 183 symptoms of COVID - 19 and tested positive for the virus had showed significantly ( P < 0 . 05 ) 184 higher level ( 67 % ) of antibody in comparison with the negative ( 16 . 5 % ) and undiagnosed 185 ( 16 . 5 % ) COVID - 19 cases . Seropositivity was also significantly higher ( 40 . 5 % ) among the 186 participants who neither tested nor experienced the conventional symptoms of COVID - 19 . 187 Among the asymptomatic participants who tested positive for SARS - CoV - 2 had developed 188 antibody at a rate of 33 . 1 % and who tested negative for SARS - CoV - 2 had developed 189 antibody at a rate of 26 . 4 % . Antibody was not detected in a good number of participants 190 ( 40 % ) who had experienced symptoms while also being diagnosed positive for COVID - 19 . 191 Among the individuals who neither tested nor experienced the conventional symptoms of 192 COVID - 19 were found seronegative at a rate of 55 . 1 % which was significantly higher 193 ( P < 0 . 05 ) than the other asymptomatic seronegative outcomes . 194 Table 4 : Seroprevelance in symptomatic and asymptomatic cases COVID - 19 Test Status Seroprevelance COVID - 19 Symptom Appearence Positive Negative Undiagnosed Total ( n = 500 ) P - value a Symptomatic 61 ( 67 % ) 15 ( 16 . 5 % ) 15 ( 16 . 5 % ) 91 Positive Asymptomatic 49 ( 33 . 1 % ) 39 ( 26 . 4 % ) 60 ( 40 . 5 % ) 148 < 0 . 05 e Symptomatic 26 ( 40 % ) 28 ( 43 % ) 11 ( 16 . 9 % ) 65 Negative Asymptomatic 26 ( 13 . 3 % ) 62 ( 31 . 6 % ) 108 ( 55 . 1 % ) 196 < 0 . 05 e 195 a P < 0 . 05 was considered to indicate significance 12 196 Prevalence of SARS - CoV - 2 antibodies 197 The monthly overview of the antibody test results is presented in Fig 1 . Over the course of 198 the study , 47 . 8 % participants were found to have antibodies against Nucleocapsid protein of 199 the virus . Number of seropositive individuals significantly increased in the last 2 months . 200 Antibody prevalence among the subjects in the 9 th and 10 th month were 64 . 2 % and 75 % 201 whereas in the 3 rd month of the study antibody development was found in only 30 . 8 % of the 202 subjects . 203 204 205 206 Discussion Fig 1 : Seroprevalence estimates per month . Percentage of seropositivity is presented with blue line and that of seronegativity is presented in red line 13 207 As the presence of IgG antibody is associated with protection against the virus , the 208 preliminary purpose of this study was to assess the status of COVID - 19 antibody 209 development among the residents of Dhaka city . The seroprevalence study was conducted 210 while Bangladesh was experiencing the second wave of the pandemic . The present study was 211 set to see a link between risk factors and IgG antibody formation and persistence of the 212 produced antibody in the body [ 16 ] . 213 There was no significant difference between male and female regarding IgG development . 214 Participants aged > 60 years had lower antibody level than patients age spanning 10 - 60 years 215 ( P < 0 . 05 ) . The highest seroprevalence found among the age group 21 - 40 . This data suggests 216 that older people have a lower response to developing protective antibodies [ 16 ] than younger 217 individuals in significant quantities [ 17 ] and therefore , older people are at higher risk of 218 developing severe symptoms [ 18 ] . This data is consistent with other seroprevalence surveys 219 done during pandemics on different populations [ 19 ] . Compared to non - smokers , current 220 smokers were found to have a lower seroprevalence ( 51 . 92 % in non - smokers , in contrast to 221 35 . 16 % seroprevalence in current smokers ) . Certain studies have indicated that smoking 222 cigarettes impairs the immune system [ 20 ] and reduces production of IgA , IgG and IgM 223 antibodies [ 21 ] . Even after vaccination , current smokers have shown significant lower 224 antibody titre [ 22 - 26 ] . 225 Regular walking and regular exercise which are actually considered as physical exercise were 226 shown to have a substantial correlation with the seropositivity of the persons among the risk 227 factors [ 27 ] . Aman & Masood , ( 2020 ) reported that a balanced and nutritious diet can help to 228 build a strong immune system that can withstand the viral attack . People who eat a well - 229 balanced diet appear to be healthier , with stronger immune systems and a lower risk of 230 infections . However , healthy dietary habits like vegetable and fruits intake on regular basis 231 were not found to have direct impact on IgG response of the subjects . 14 232 The efficacy of Sinopharm vaccine which uses whole attenuated virus [ 29 ] in its dosage were 233 estimated in our study . The seropositivity of Sinopharm vaccinated subjects were found 234 81 . 8 % . The individuals vaccinated by Pfizer , Moderna and Astrazeneca were found to have a 235 moderate development of antibody in their body . These vaccines use mRNA of spike protein 236 in their dosage . As we assessed antibody against Nucleocapsid protein of the virus , antibody 237 development against mRNA vaccines were not found in satisfactory level . Among the mRNA 238 vaccinated individuals , some have developed IgG antibody against Nucleocapsid protein 239 through direct infection of SARS - CoV - 2 either before or after vaccination [ 30 ] . No 240 significant difference was found among the vaccinated and non - vaccinated subjects . 241 It has already been established that older age and certain comorbidities are risk factors for 242 hospitalization and death by COVID - 19 infection [ 31 ] . This study has showed that the 243 existence of comorbidities lowers IgG response in the individuals which is supported by 244 Hoque et al . , ( 2021 ) who stated that the existence of comorbidity lowers antibody response in 245 human body . This indicated that the older individuals over 60 years and individuals with co - 246 morbidities are more likely to develop a defective immune response and suffer higher rates of 247 morbidity and mortality [ 32 ] . Watanabe et al . , ( 2022 ) stated that Hypertension were strongly 248 associated with lower antibody titers which supports our findings that IgG developments 249 were significantly low in patients suffering from hypertension ( 33 . 6 % ) and Diabetes ( 37 . 2 % ) . 250 In another study it had been found that some comorbidities , including hypertension , COPD , 251 immunosuppression , and type 2 diabetes , were negatively linked with vaccine efficacy [ 34 ] . 252 The seropositivity rate was higher in symptomatic than in asymptomatic COVID - 19 infection 253 ( 67 % versus 33 . 1 % ; P < 0 . 05 ) . This observation is supported by previous studies where 254 COVID - 19 associated symptoms had higher IgG humoral response and antibody titers 255 compared to asymptomatic patients [ 35 - 37 ] . Varying levels of antibody against anti - SARS - 256 CoV - 2 is linked to the severity of the disease [ 36 , 38 ] . In symptomatic cases , IgG and IgM 15 257 positively elevates and overall immune response develops shortly after infection [ 29 , 39 ] . 258 Interestingly , among the asymptomatic individuals seropositivity was higher in the 259 undiagnosed individuals ( 40 . 5 % ) than the COVID - 19 tested positive ( 33 . 1 % ) and negative 260 ( 26 . 4 % ) individuals . This observation is supported by Shirin et al . , ( 2020 ) who found lower 261 antibody levels in people with asymptomatic infection . On the other hand , positive immune 262 response was found in asymptomatic uninfected individuals either through vaccination [ 17 ] 263 or immunity developed through previous infection with COVID - 19 [ 15 , 41 ] . In this study 264 asymptomatic undiagnosed individuals showed higher immune response either they were 265 silently infected but did not have any confirmatory test of COVID - 19 or vaccination 266 increased their immune status . Higher seronegativity ( 40 % ) was found in COVID - 19 infected 267 symptomatic individuals than the asymptomatic individuals ( 13 . 3 % ) . Alongside , in 268 undiagnosed symptomatic and asymptomatic participants , the seronegativity rate was 16 . 9 % 269 and 55 . 1 % respectively . This can be caused by either impaired IgG response because of 270 immune suppressive factors ( such as Comorbidities , old age etc . ) [ 17 ] or antibody reduction 271 after a significant time . In the majority of people , IgG responses against SARS - CoV - 2 appear 272 to persist longer than 6 months [ 42 - 44 ] which is associated with age and disease severity [ 45 ] . 273 A rise in seroprevalence was evident over the study ' s ten months , with the peak occurring in 274 the last month . Seropositivity went from 39 . 3 % in the first month to 75 % by the end of last 275 month . 276 The serological study found that the prevalence of antibodies against Nucleocapsid protein of 277 SARS - CoV - 2 was found in 47 . 8 % of the study subjects . This study shows that a large 278 population had developed COVID - 19 specific antibodies during the 2nd year of the pandemic 279 while the nationwide vaccination program was going in full swing . Therefore , the data 280 suggests that a vast majority of the population is protected against COVID - 19 as long as 281 antibody persists in the body . 16 282 There are some major limitations to this study . Firstly , we assessed the development of IgG 283 against Nucleocapsid protein using the ELISA technique . This excludes the assessment of 284 subjects who developed antibody through vaccination by vaccines that uses mRNA of Spike 285 protein . As a result , the study excludes a substantial percentage of seropositive participants . 286 Secondly , there was an over representation of working - class people of the age group 21 - 60 . 287 The study population wasn’t completely random rather the research concentrated on working 288 class people who had gone out during the pandemic . Thirdly , the accuracy and credibility of 289 serology assays are questioned because of the risk of false - positive instances due to cross - 290 reaction with other coronavirus such as the common cold . Again , false negative results are 291 also plausible . However , serology tests by ELISA yielded high specificity of around 99 % 292 [ 46 ] . Finally , this research also excluded the group of physically working people like 293 rickshaw puller and daily laborer . 294 Conclusion : 295 Seroprevalence data are crucial for determining the pandemic ' s scope and spread , as well as 296 predicting the likelihood of subsequent waves . It addresses public health issues , such as the 297 need for future lockdowns and the success of immunization campaigns , booster dosage 298 requirements and the time interval between booster doses . However , the seroprevalence data 299 also represent the efficiency of different vaccines , vaccinated among the individuals of our 300 country . 301 Data Availability : 302 Data available on request .
