Received : 10 December 2013 ; in revised form : 19 March 2014 / Accepted : 26 March 2014 / Published : 9 April 2014 Abstract : Signal segmentation is a crucial stage in the activity recognition process ; however , this has been rarely and vaguely characterized so far . Windowing approaches are normally used for segmentation , but no clear consensus exists on which window size should be preferably employed . In fact , most designs normally rely on ﬁgures used in previous works , but with no strict studies that support them . Intuitively , decreasing the window size allows for a faster activity detection , as well as reduced resources and energy needs . On the contrary , large data windows are normally considered for the recognition of complex activities . In this work , we present an extensive study to fairly characterize the windowing procedure , to determine its impact within the activity recognition process and to help clarify some of the habitual assumptions made during the recognition system design . To that end , some of the most widely used activity recognition procedures are evaluated for a wide range of window sizes and activities . From the evaluation , the interval 1 – 2 s proves to provide the best trade - off between recognition speed and accuracy . The study , speciﬁcally intended for on - body activity recognition systems , further provides designers with a set of guidelines devised to facilitate the system deﬁnition and conﬁguration according to the particular application requirements and target activities .

Introduction During the last few years , a tremendous interest in the evaluation of people’s habits and daily routines has awakened . The analysis of human behavior has been demonstrated to be of key value to better understand people’s necessities and demands . This understanding is of utility in a wide variety of ﬁelds , from education , medicine or sociology , to gaming or other kinds of industries with a demonstrated potential impact on society [ 1 ] . Nevertheless , healthcare , assistance and wellness are possibly the ﬁelds that most actively leverage the knowledge gained from the analysis of human behavior . Here , the use of this information is , for example , devised for people’s health empowerment . Promoting healthier lifestyles ( e . g . , encouraging exercising [ 2 , 3 ] ) , preventing unhealthy habits ( e . g . , tobacco use or unwholesome food [ 4 , 5 ] ) , detecting anomalous behaviors ( e . g . , fall detection [ 6 – 8 ] ) or tracking conditions ( e . g . , mobility worsening due to aging or illnesses [ 9 ] ) are different applications which may proﬁt from the inference of human behavior . The inference of human behavior could be performed in different ways ; however , a mainstream discipline stands out among the others . Also known as activity recognition , it aims at interpreting people’s movements , actions and goals through the use of diverse sensing technologies . Activity recognition normally makes use of sensors on and around the subject to register their movements , while expert systems employ the monitored data to detect the performed activities . Among the diverse technologies used for activity detection , on - body sensing proves to be the most prevalent monitoring technology . On - body or wearable activity recognition systems normally consist of a set of sensors attached to the person’s body that deliver signals ( data streams ) of diverse modalities . These could be of a continuous or discrete nature , but in any case , the data stream must be segmented in data windows for processing . The segmentation process should be normally deﬁned depending on the particular requirements of the application for which the recognition system is devised . Some systems are planned for detecting a speciﬁc activity ; thus , a particular segmentation could be found to optimize the recognition quality . Other applications may need to identify several activities or actions , therefore requiring a data partitioning that works well on average for the target activities . Moreover , depending on the addressed problem , a fast identiﬁcation may be needed ( e . g . , fall detection ) or , conversely , it may not have special time requirements ( e . g . , kilometers walked in a day ) . Since reducing the recognition time ( i . e . , segmentation ) may have an inﬂuence on the system performance , a tradeoff between detection time and accuracy should be considered by recognition system designers . Despite the importance of this , little work has been devoted to investigating this fact . In this work , we present an extensive study of the effects of segmentation for diverse recognition techniques and activities . Considered the sliding window approach , the most widely used segmentation method , we evaluate the performance of several recognition systems for an extensive set of window sizes that also covers the values used in previous works . This characterization is deﬁned for a wide variety of representative activities . The rest of the paper is structured as follows . In Section 2 , an extensive review of the activity recognition segmentation process is presented . Section 3 brieﬂy describes the activity recognition methodology used in this study . Next , the results obtained for the different Sensors 2014 , 14 6476 experiments performed are presented . These results are subsequently discussed in Section 5 , while our ﬁnal conclusions are summarized in Section 6 . 2 . State of the Art Segmentation corresponds to the process of dividing sensor signals into smaller data segments . This process has been performed in different ways in the activity recognition ﬁeld . Most of the segmentation techniques could be categorized into three groups , namely activity - deﬁned windows , event - deﬁned windows and sliding windows . The main contributions to each category for on - body sensing activity recognition are summarized in Table 1 . Table 1 . Principal segmentation techniques . Activity - deﬁned windows Sekine et al .

( 2013 ) [ 65 ] The activity - deﬁned windowing procedure consists of a partitioning of the sensor data stream based on the detection of activity changes . Initial and end points are determined for each activity , prior to explicitly identifying the speciﬁc activities . In the literature , diverse methods have been proposed to identify activity - transition points . For example , changes between activities could be identiﬁed through the analysis of variations in the frequency characteristics . In this regard , Sekine et al . [ 10 ] proposed a model based on wavelet decomposition to detect frequency changes for three walking activities ( level walking , walking upstairs and walking downstairs ) from a continuous record . A similar approach is used in [ 11 ] , though only a subset of the activity window is eventually used for classiﬁcation . In order to improve the activity change detection , Yoshizawa et al . [ 12 ] proposed a heuristic method that differentiates among static and dynamic actions . The identiﬁcation of initial and end points could be also approached by leveraging the user feedback . This way , in [ 13 , 14 ] , the monitored volunteers are made to participate in the segmentation process by requiring them to set initial and end points in a handheld device . Less obtrusively , in [ 15 ] , the subjects are asked to stand still for a few seconds to better identify the start and stop of each activity . Activity windows are also deﬁned in an ofﬂine manner for activities of a long duration . In [ 16 ] , this approach is applied to activities , such as walking , running and jumping , which are partitioned into 1 - min duration segments . Although these could be strictly considered activity - deﬁned approaches , they are rarely devised for recognition purposes , but better planned for labeling procedures . Sensors 2014 , 14 6477 Some activities could be better recognized as a sequence of movements or actions performed in a certain order . This is the case of sporadic activities , such as household activities ( e . g . , meal preparation , room cleaning ) , in which the activity or gesture occurs sporadically and is interspersed with other activities or gestures . For gesture recognition or isolated movement detection , the identiﬁcation of speciﬁc events is particularly advised . The event - deﬁned approach consists of locating speciﬁc events , which are further used to deﬁne successive data partitioning . Since the events may not be uniformly distributed in time , the size of the corresponding windows is not ﬁxed . Gait analysis has principally beneﬁted from this type of analysis . Concretely , the detection of heel strikes ( the initial ﬂoor contact ) and toe - offs ( the end of ﬂoor contact ) events is normally pursued here . In [ 17 , 18 ] , the detection of the initial and the end contact of the foot with the ground is performed through analyzing the foot’s linear acceleration . Foot [ 19 ] and shank [ 20 ] sagittal angular velocity is also utilized to identify these events . Benocci et al . [ 21 ] recognizes walking by using a model that identiﬁes the gait cycle on a single foot tagged through a heel strike event . Sant’Anna and Wickstr¨om [ 22 ] presents a symbol - based method used to detect the phases of the gait . Interpreting the acceleration signal , heel strikes are reﬂected as a valley and large variances , whilst toe - offs are presented as a peak . More recently , Aung et al . [ 23 ] proposed the use of a simple Gaussian mixture model to classify data samples into heel strike , toe - off or no event categories . As for the activity - deﬁned approach , the events could be also identiﬁed through external mechanisms . The registration of these events could be , for example , performed through a stopwatch . In [ 24 ] , the stopwatch count is started when the hind foot ﬁrst crossed a given start line and then stopped when the lead foot ﬁrst crossed the end line . Again , this kind of approach is restricted to laboratory settings or recognition under expert supervision , which is found to be of little use in real settings . Both activity - deﬁned and event - deﬁned methods are particularly interesting for spotting purposes ; however , the size of the window normally determines that a subsegmentation process is required . The sliding window approach , hereafter referred to as “windowing” , is the most widely employed segmentation technique in activity recognition . Its implementational simplicity and lack of preprocessing determines the windowing approach as ideally suited to real - time applications . Here , the signals are split into windows of a ﬁxed size and with no inter - window gaps . An overlap between adjacent windows is tolerated for certain applications ; however , this is less frequently used . A range of window sizes have been used in previous studies ( Figure 1 ) from 0 . 1 s [ 25 ] to 12 . 8 s [ 26 ] or more [ 27 , 28 ] , with some studies including a degree of overlap between windows [ 29 – 31 ] . Tables 2 and 3 present an extensive review for the windowing approach . The sliding window approach has been proven to be especially beneﬁcial for the recognition of periodic ( e . g . , walking , running ) and static activities ( e . g . , standing , sitting ) and of questionable utility for the detection of sporadic activities . As has been mentioned , sporadic activities require a more sophisticated segmentation process given their complex and interspersed nature . Sensors 2014 , 14 6478 Table 2 .

Activity Recognition Methods Signal segmentation is one of the stages of the activity recognition process , also known as the activity recognition chain ( Figure 2 ) . Concretely , a set of nodes ( sensors ) usually delivers a stream of raw unprocessed signals , which represent the magnitude measured ( e . g . , acceleration ) . The registered information may be disturbed by electronic noise or other kinds of artifacts . These disturbances are sometimes removed through a ﬁltering process [ 18 , 66 ] ; however , this is not always applied , since it may imply a certain information loss . In order to capture the dynamics of the signals , these are partitioned into segments of data . As already described in Section 2 , different techniques could be used for this purpose , albeit the windowing approach is the most widely used for its simplicity and tractability . In Figure 2 , diverse windowing procedures , respectively corresponding to different window sizes , are depicted . Subsequently , a feature extraction process is carried out to provide a handler representation of the signals for the pattern recognition stage . A wide range of heuristics [ 67 ] , time / frequency domain [ 44 , 45 ] and other sophisticated mathematical and statistic functions [ 68 ] are commonly used . The feature vector is provided as the input of the classiﬁer or reasoner [ 69 ] , ultimately yielding the recognized activity or class to one of those considered for the target problem . As can be seen from Figure 2 , a feature vector is computed for each data window , thus also determining the rate at which the classiﬁcation or recognition is performed . Therefore , reducing the window size translates into a faster detection at the expense of using less data for the feature computation . The tradeoff between window size and recognition performance is extensively analyzed and characterized for diverse activity recognition models in this work . Sensors 2014 , 14 6481 Figure 2 . Different stages of the activity recognition chain ( ARC ) . An example of the correlation of the windowing approach and subsequent levels of the ARC is shown . Here , different window sizes are depicted particularly . Concretely , M sensors deliver raw signals ( u 1 , u 2 , . . . , u M ) , which are subsequently processed ( p 1 , p 2 , . . . , p M ) . The signals are partitioned into data windows of size W k ( e . g . , s 1 W k , s 2 W k , . . . , s MW k ) . For each window , k , a set of features are extracted and aggregated in a single feature vector ( f 1 ( s 1 W k ) , f 2 ( s 2 W k ) , . . . , f M ( s MW k ) ) that is used as the input to a classiﬁer . The classiﬁer yields a class ( c W k ) that represents the identiﬁed activity .

Results 4 . 1 . Experimental Setup To evaluate the impact of signal segmentation on the recognition process , an adequate representative dataset must be used . Taking into account the characteristics of the sliding window technique and its normal use ( Section 2 ) , the activities of a periodic and static nature are particularly considered . Here , one of the most complete activity recognition benchmark datasets is used [ 70 ] . This dataset comprises motion data recorded from 17 volunteers of diverse proﬁles performing 33 ﬁtness activities ( Table 4 ) while wearing a set of nine inertial sensors attached to different parts of their bodies . This dataset not only stands out for the number of considered activities , but for the diversity of body parts involved in each one ( e . g . , lateral elevation of the arms vs . knees bending ) , the intensity of the actions ( e . g . , Sensors 2014 , 14 6482 cycling vs . waist rotation ) and their execution speed or dynamicity ( e . g . , running vs . standing while hand - clapping ) . The activities are collected in an out - of - lab environment with no constraints on the way these must be executed , with the exception that the subject should try their best when executing them . The use of multiple sensors also permits measuring the motion ( namely , the acceleration , the rate of turn and the magnetic ﬁeld orientation ) experienced by each body limb and trunk , thus better capturing the body dynamics . Here , only the acceleration data is considered for the study , since this proves to be the most prevalent sensor modality in previous activity recognition contributions [ 71 , 72 ] . The dataset provides data for three different scenarios , one for a default setting and two others for the study of sensor anomalies ( out of the scope of this work ) ; thus , only the data for the default setup is here used . Table 4 . Warm up , cool down and ﬁtness exercises considered for the activity set .

No preprocessing of the data is applied to avoid the removal of relevant information . This is normal practice when the activities are diverse , even more when the quality of the registered data permits it . The segmentation process basically consists of a non - overlapping sliding window approach . Different window sizes are used for evaluation , concretely ranging from 0 . 25 s to 7 s in steps of 0 . 25 s . This interval comprises most of the values used in previous activity recognition systems . The segmentation process is applied for each activity in isolation . Three feature sets ( FS ) are respectively used for evaluation : FS1 = “mean” , FS2 = “mean and standard deviation” and FS3 = “mean , standard deviation , maximum , minimum and mean crossing rate” . These are some of the features most widely used in activity recognition [ 16 , 29 , 41 , 44 , 58 ] for their discrimination potential and ease of interpretation in the acceleration domain . Likewise , four of the most extensively and successfully machine learning techniques used in previous activity recognition problems are considered for classiﬁcation : C4 . 5 decision trees ( DT , [ 73 ] ) , k - nearest neighbors ( kNN , [ 74 ] ) , naive Bayes ( NB , [ 75 ] ) and nearest centroid classiﬁer ( NCC , [ 76 ] ) . The k - value for the KNN model is empirically set to three . System evaluation is carried out through a cross - validation process . Although leave - one - subject - out cross validation ( LOOXV ) has been used in the literature , here , a ten - fold cross - validation ( 10 - fold XV ) process is rather chosen to compare the diverse models . In fact , as summarized in [ 77 ] and according to [ 78 , 79 ] , LOOXV is the best technique for risk estimation , whereas 10 - fold XV is the most accurate approach for model selection . Moreover , this process is repeated 100 times to ensure Sensors 2014 , 14 6483 statistical robustness , as well as to procure an asymptotic convergence to a correct estimation of the system performance [ 80 ] . The F 1 - score [ 81 ] , a combination of precision and recall measures , is used as a performance metric to assess the quality of the recognition for each system design . This metric is particularly interesting for its robustness to class imbalance , which happens to occur when there are more instances for some activities than for others . The F 1 - score ranges between [ 0 , 1 ] , where one represents an optimal recognition capabilities , whilst zero corresponds to a system that is not capable of recognition at all . 4 . 2 . Global Evaluation In this section , we analyze the general effects of the windowing operation on the activity recognition process . The performance results for diverse window sizes and each speciﬁc methodology are depicted in Figure 3 . At ﬁrst glance , the performance tendency for each individual classiﬁcation technique is maintained for all feature sets . This determines that these results could be , in principle , generalized to other recognition models of a similar nature . Systems based on FS3 ( the richest feature set considered ) provide better performance than for FS2 , which , in turn , notably improves the results obtained for FS1 . This difference among the results for FS1 , FS2 and FS3 may indicate that the use of more features may lead to improved results . Thus , the reported results could be considered a lower bound on the recognition performance . Figure 3 . Effect of the data window size on the activity recognition system performance ( F 1 - score ) . Twelve recognition systems , respectively , corresponding to the combination of three feature sets ( FS1 , FS2 , FS3 ) and four classiﬁcation models ( DT , NB , NCC , KNN ) are evaluated .

The NB and NCC models show an increasing performance as the size of the window grows . The minimum performance is obtained for 0 . 25 s , which nevertheless increases up to 30 % when the window Sensors 2014 , 14 6484 is enlarged to 1 s . Actually , a “cut - off” window size is found at 1 s for all feature sets . From that value on , no signiﬁcant beneﬁts are obtained in general . For NB - FS1 , less than a 5 % improvement is achieved for some random window sizes when compared to the performance at 1 s . This also applies to a lesser extent for the NB - FS2 model . Conversely , increasing the window size more than 2 s entails a worsening of the recognition performance for NCC - FS3 . DT shows a top performance for window sizes between one and 2 s . Upper and lower values to these generally decrease the performance of the recognizer . The KNN model stands out among all evaluated techniques and allows us to maximally reduce the window size . This technique provides the highest performance , with an F 1 - score above 0 . 95 for the simplest realization ( FS1 ) and close to one for FS2 and FS3 , all for minimum window sizes ( 0 . 25 s – 0 . 5 s ) . For window sizes higher than 2 s for FS1 and FS3 , and 3 s for FS2 , the performance of the KNN systems decreases monotonically . The lowest performance is achieved for a window size of 7 s , which , for some cases , is up to 15 % less than the baseline . 4 . 3 . Activity - Speciﬁc Analysis A global evaluation is of utility to have an overall view of the segmentation effects on the recognition process . Nevertheless , it is also found to be of interest to particularize this study to each speciﬁc considered activity . Thus , in the following , an extensive analysis of the systems recognition capabilities for the target activities is presented . In Figures 4 and 5 , the activity - speciﬁc recognition performance achieved for each methodology and for diverse window sizes is presented . Actually , not all window sizes are highlighted , but the minimum values that are necessary to obtain a certain performance . This comes from the idea of reducing the window size as much as possible , which corresponds to one of the normal design criteria . The other more habitually sought criterion is to maximize the recognition conﬁdence . This way , these ﬁgures are devised as a perfect means to visually inspect the trade - off between performance and window size for each speciﬁc activity . As expected from the results shown in Figure 3 , the richer the feature set used , the higher the recognition performance obtained . Likewise , the best performance is observed for the systems based on DT and , foremost , KNN . Not only is KNN the most accurate method , but the one that maximally minimizes the required window size . In either case , the demonstrated recognition capabilities of all these systems apply differently to each activity type . Thus , for example , 4 – 6 prove to be the most difﬁcult activities to be recognized . This happens to occur for all methodologies , although to a much lesser extent for KNN . The worst results are obtained for the NCC - FS1 approach , for which Activity 6 records a F 1 - score of 0 . 2 . Activities 4 – 6 correspond to very short actions , concretely various types of jumps . Therefore , the difﬁculty when detecting these activities could derive from the small amount of information registered during the execution of an instance of these actions and their similarity . Including more data ( i . e . , increasing the window size ) serves to improve the recognition performance ( up to 40 % for NB and NCC ) , yet this is insufﬁcient for practical use . Conversely , KNN perfectly copes with the challenge of distinguishing among these three activities and even for very reduced window sizes . KNN has proved in previous works to operate well for gesture recognition [ 82 , 83 ] , which here supports the learning of subtle differences among activities of that short duration . Other activities , Sensors 2014 , 14 6485 such as 24 ( shoulders low - amplitude rotation ) and 26 ( knees alternating to the breast ) , are also hardly recognizable for NB , NCC and DT with FS1 ; however , this is enhanced when a richer feature set is used . Activities that involve movements of the complete body are more easily recognized . Thus , for example , different types of translation ( e . g . , Activities 1 – 3 , walking and running ) or sports exercises ( Activities 31 – 33 , rowing , elliptical bike and cycling ) are accurately recognized ( F 1 - score > 0 . 9 ) for all methodologies and almost absolutely for KNN . Even when good results are obtained for the simplest realization ( FS1 ) , the use of more informative feature sets makes it possible to signiﬁcantly reduce the size of the windows ( i . e . , from windows of 6 s or more to windows of 1 s or less ) . Furthermore , in this line , the activities that involve speciﬁc trunk movements are fairly detected . Trunk twists , waist rotations and lateral bends are examples of these activities ( Exercises 9 – 17 ) . The reason why all these activities are better identiﬁed is possibly a consequence of having informative data coming from several body parts . Not only is this important for the sake of recognition , but for reducing the window size requirements . Since these activities involve the movement of most body parts , the data captured from these better describe the performed action . Thus , less data are , in principle , required for the activity detection ; otherwise , the window size may be reduced . On the contrary , when some body parts do not experience a relevant movement or are similarly displaced for a set of actions , the information monitored on these parts becomes of little utility for discrimination . It is also worth noting that for some activities , the required window size could be signiﬁcantly reduced just by relaxing the performance conditions . Thus , for example , Activity 16 ( lateral bend with arm up ) may be recognized through the KNN - FS2 model with a maximum level of conﬁdence ( F 1 - score = 1 ) when a 7 s window is used . By tolerating a recognition performance of 0 . 99 ( i . e . , a 1 % drop ) , the window size could be reduced to just 0 . 25 s . Something similar could be seen for DT and Activity 31 ( rowing ) , allowing for a shortening from 3 . 25 to 0 . 25 s at the expense of a subtle performance drop . The optimization of the window size could be better seen in Figure 6 . Here , two examples of the trade - off between performance and window size , respectively , applying to the DT - FS2 and KNN - FS2 methods are presented . Now , for the particular case of DT and Activity 31 ( Figure 6a ) , a 0 . 002 reduction of the maximum performance already allows us to narrow down the window size to 1 . 5 s . If the reduction is of 0 . 005 , the minimum window size is applicable . The detection of other activities , such as 15 ( trunk lateral bend ) and 25 ( arm inner rotation ) may be also sped up from 5 . 5 s to 0 . 25 s by reducing the top performance in 5 % , yet keeping a F 1 - score of more than 0 . 92 . For KNN - FS2 , the results are even more promising . A penalty of 2 % with respect to the maximum performance ( here , close to one for almost all activities ) allow us to use the minimum window size for 28 out of the 33 activities . This performance drop translates into F 1 - score values of 0 . 92 at worst . Nine of these 28 ( concretely , Activities 7 , 10 , 12 , 13 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 30 and 33 ) are recognized with a conﬁdence level of 0 . 98 . Again , these are activities that involve movements of the complete body . Other examples for which an outstanding window size reduction could be applied at the expense of a negligible performance drop ( 0 . 001 ) could be seen for Activities 16 , 18 and 33 . This further applies to Activity 1 ( walking ) , which could be detected with a conﬁdence of 0 . 984 for a 0 . 25 s window size . This result is encountered as special value , since this is possibly the most widely performed activity in daily living and considered for recognition in most systems . All these results demonstrate the importance of not only seeking the best performance , but also considering an adequate windowing procedure . Sensors 2014 , 14 6486 Figure 4 .

Discussion Although signal segmentation is a very important part of activity recognition systems , there is no clear consensus about how to apply it . Here , we provide an extensive study to bring light to this fact , a Sensors 2014 , 14 6489 study that could be roughly summarized in two main conclusions : window size signiﬁcantly matters , and short windows normally lead to better recognition performances . From the global analysis , the interval 1 – 2 s proves to provide the best trade - off between recognition speed and accuracy . The use of larger windows is seen to be required when simple feature sets are employed , while this turns out to not be necessary when richer feature sets are used , thus demonstrating the strong relation between the featuring and windowing processes . The obtained results help reject the generalized idea of considering that the more data used for the feature extraction , the more accurate the recognizer is . Previous work demonstrated that long window sizes are normally required to capture the high motion variability found in activities with a complex description , such as household activities ; however , many others may beneﬁt from shorter window sizes . Activities that involve the complete body or several parts are more easily recognized and also permit one to optimize the window duration . Examples of these activities are walking , jogging or running , as well as other sports exercises . These activities are better described than those that only involve some body parts , as happens to occur for some sorts of jumps and some individual limb movements . In that case , some of the data windows captured from some body parts are not of much utility for discrimination , and the recognition process relies on a reduced set of informative windows . To compensate for this , further data are needed from the more informative ones ( i . e . , larger data windows ) . Design guidelines . As is demonstrated in this study , in many cases , a subtle reduction in the system performance allow us to signiﬁcantly shorten the window size . This is specially important for those applications that require a rapid detection , such as fall or epileptic seizure detectors . Moreover , other activities are better recognized for shorter window sizes . When designing an activity recognition system , the expert may need to prioritize detection performance or speed or even both . In most cases , a trade - off between both characteristics is required . One of the initial objectives of this work was to provide a reference tool to help designers to select an adequate segmentation conﬁguration for the particular problem considered . In the following , speciﬁc windowing guidelines are provided for common activity categories based on the body parts they involve ( legs , arms , back , waist and combinations ) , the intensity of the actions ( energetic , non - energetic ) , mobility ( translation ) or their speciﬁc application domain ( rehabilitation , military , gaming , sports and wellness ) . The complete set of results and ﬁgures provided in Section 4 are here proﬁted from to elaborate speciﬁc conclusions and guidelines devised to be generalized to other recognition systems and applications . Concretely , for each activity category , the minimum window sizes are provided that permit a reasonable ( F 1 - score > 0 . 85 ) recognition performance ( W min size , recognition speed prioritization ) and the window sizes that allow for optimal recognition capabilities ( W max perf , recognition performance prioritization ) . These window values are obtained through comparing the performance across all classiﬁcation methodologies ( DT , KNN , NB , NCC ) for the most promising feature set ( FS3 ) and for all the activities considered for each speciﬁc category . Through this , it is sought to achieve a generalization of the conclusions beyond the particular results obtained for each individual methodology . Firstly , the activities are categorized based on the body parts that they principally involve during their execution . Correspondingly , activities in which arm movements are seen ( i . e . , 19 – 25 ) may be reasonably recognized for a W min size ranging between 0 . 5 and 1 s . An optimal recognition of these activities requires W max perf values between 0 . 75 ( shoulders low - amplitude rotation ) and 2 . 25 s ( frontal Sensors 2014 , 14 6490 hand claps ) . Non - translation actions that predominantly involve the legs ( i . e . , 26 – 30 ) require a W min size that spans from 0 . 25 ( rotation on the knees ) to 1 . 75 ( knees alternating to the breast ) , while an optimal recognition is achieved for W max perf between 1 . 25 to 5 . 75 s . Activities that basically involve trunk movements ( i . e . , 12 , 15 and 17 ) require W min size values between 0 . 5 to 1 . 25 s , while a maximal recognition is obtained for W max perf 0 . 75 s for waist rotation , 2 . 25 s for repetitive forward stretching and 6 . 25 s for lateral bending . Other activities involve the motion of combinations of the former body parts . For example , exercises involving trunk and arm movements ( i . e . , 9 – 11 , 13 and 16 ) are optimally recognized for W max perf in the range of 1 – 4 . 5 s , while the minimum window size is observed for W min size values between 0 . 5 to 1 . 25 s . Movements of the trunk and legs are observed in actions ( i . e . , 30 and 33 ) that may be maximally recognized for W max perf values between 1 – 1 . 25 s and a W min size of 0 . 25 s . Finally , activities that generally involve the movement of all the body parts ( i . e . , 2 – 8 , 18 , 28 , 29 , 31 and 32 ) may be recognized for W min size between 0 . 25 and 3 . 25 s and optimally identiﬁed for W max perf that range from 0 . 5 s for rowing to 4 s for upper trunk and lower body opposite twist . For those activities that determine an effective translation of the subject ( i . e . , 1 – 3 ) , it is seen that W min size spans from 0 . 25 to 0 . 5 s , while a maximum performance is obtained for W max perf values between one and 1 . 5 s . The window size requirements signiﬁcantly vary among the ﬁve types of jumps analyzed in this work ( i . e . , 4 – 8 ) . A minimum window size of 0 . 5 s is possible for the detection of the activity , jumping , opening and closing legs and arms , whilst a W min size of 3 . 25 s is required to identify the jumping front and back exercise . Minimum window sizes for the rest of the jumps are within an interval of 0 . 5 to 3 . 25 s . To achieve a maximum recognition performance , the window size must be enlarged . Thus , W max perf spans from 1 . 75 s for the jumping sideways exercise to 6 . 75 s for jumping rope . Another categorization may be performed considering the intensity of the activities , here deﬁned as energetic and non - energetic activities . Energetic activities ( i . e . , 1 – 8 , 18 , 23 , 26 , 28 , 29 , 31 – 33 ) can be reasonably recognized for W min size values that range from 0 . 25 to 3 . 25 s , while for an optimal recognition , W max perf should be between one and 3 . 25 s . The remaining activities ( i . e . , 9 – 17 , 19 – 22 , 24 , 25 , 27 , and 30 ) , here classiﬁed as less - or non - energetic , are best recognized for W max perf between 1 . 25 and 5 . 75 s , while the minimum window size W min size ranges between 0 . 25 and 2 s . The activities considered in this study could be seen as part of the target set of actions devised for some activity recognition applications . Here , various application domains are identiﬁed , taking into account the characteristics of these activities . The ﬁrst domain corresponds to exercises for rehabilitation purposes . Activities involving legs , the trunk and legs and the complete body ( i . e . , 2 – 8 , 18 , 26 – 33 ) could be part of the rehabilitation or stimulation exercises of the lower body . For these activities , a W max perf ranging between 1 . 25 and 3 . 25 s is required for an optimal recognition , whilst the minimum window size spans from W min size 0 . 25 to 3 . 25 s . Rehabilitation exercises for the upper body involve arms and the trunk and arm activities ( i . e . , 9 – 11 , 13 , 16 , 19 – 25 ) that are optimally recognized for W max perf between 1 . 25 and 2 . 25 s , while W min size values range from one to 1 . 25 s . Activities similar to the one considered in the training of security and military forces or bodies ( i . e . , 1 – 6 , 18 , 26 and 27 ) require W min size values between 0 . 25 and 2 s and W max perf values between one and 5 . 75 s . Some of the analyzed activities could be also within the scope of speciﬁc gaming applications . For example , some games may require detecting some sort of jumps ( i . e . , 4 – 8 ) , hits ( i . e . , 20 , 23 ) or dance steps ( i . e . , 12 , 18 , 19 , 22 , Sensors 2014 , 14 6491 28 ) . The window size values presented above for the jump category may be likewise applied to games involving jumps . The recognition of hits require a W min size of 1 s and W max perf values between 1 . 25 and 1 . 75 s . For the movements identiﬁed to be usable in dance games , the W min size may range between 0 . 5 and 2 s , whereas the W max perf values span between 0 . 75 and 4 s . The last application domain corresponds to wellness and sports . The activities considered in this work may be part of warm up and cool down routines typically performed before sports practice , as well as ﬁtness exercises normally performed during wellness training . For this case , all the activities may be considered . For an optimal recognition of the activities , W max perf is seen to range between 0 . 5 and 6 . 75 , while the W min size spans from 0 . 25 to 3 . 25 s . All these guidelines are summarized in Table 5 . Table 5 .

Accordingly , the authors rather propose these guidelines as a hint to help orientate designers within the task of ascertaining which window size should be preferentially utilized . A good practice would consist in evaluating the recognition system capabilities for diverse window size values within the interval identiﬁed according to the recognition priority ( speed or performance ) . Study generalization . For the sake of generalization , the tested recognition systems here correspond with the ones the most widely used in related works . Moreover , simplicity and comprehensiveness were key elements that were born in mind during the selection of the models , thereby allowing us to Sensors 2014 , 14 6492 focus on the potential impact of the segmentation stage . Thus , for example , data directly captured through the sensors are used , avoiding any kind of ﬁltering or preprocessing . These procedures normally remove some parts of the raw signals that may potentially lead to a change in the signal space , which may limit the applicability of these results to other designs . Moreover , the features used are very simple , easy to calculate and with interpretable physical meaning . Concretely , the “mean” allows us to extract the contribution to the acceleration from the gravitational component , which is particularly informative for distinguishing among sedentary or low - intensity activities . The “standard deviation” , “minimum” and “maximum” provide insights into the intensity and magnitude of the movements , while the “mean crossing rate” correlates with the dynamicity and frequency of the executions . Similar tendencies have been found for the various feature sets for each independent classiﬁcation methodology , thus demonstrating that the results obtained here could be extrapolated to other systems of a similar nature . In either case , the differences among performance quality for each feature set determine that an automatic selection of better features could possibly lead to improved results . The generalization of the results and , principally , the provided guidelines is also achieved through the use of some of the most widely used standard classiﬁcation methodologies in the activity recognition domain . This makes it possible to decouple the conclusions obtained for each activity category from each particular classiﬁcation paradigm . Sampling rate . One may argue that the results presented in this study may be subject to the considered signal sampling rate . Although the amount of data that conforms a given window depends on this , we consciously decided to deﬁne the experiments in terms of time , since this is a magnitude common to any activity realization . Therefore , the results obtained here could be , in principle , applied to other monitoring systems with a different sampling rate . Performance metrics . The recognition capabilities of a given system are normally measured in terms of accuracy . Despite this metric having been and being extensively used in many ﬁelds , its use is only recommended for those problems in which there are no imbalance issues [ 84 ] . Because of this , in this work , we rather used the F 1 - score metric , which lacks this sort of limitation . Consequently , the results obtained in this work could be generalized for each activity independently of the number of available instances for each target activity . Challenges and limitations . The presented results have been provided just for acceleration data ; however , current tendencies show that the use of other sensing modalities could help to improve recognition performance and system robustness . Gyroscopes and magnetometers are more and more frequently used in combination with accelerometers for recognition purposes . Although accelerometers have proven to sufﬁce , an analysis with these other modalities could be of interest . Moreover , a similar study of this could be also valuable for other activity recognition domains , such as for computer vision or ambient intelligence . One of the main conclusions derived from this work is that activities involving several body parts are more easily recognizable and allow for shorter window sizes . To monitor several body parts , a setup , such as the one considered in this work consisting of several sensors , is required . Therefore , the results presented here are of limited application to those systems that rely on a very reduced set of sensors or even a unique device . Nevertheless , the latest contributions show that ensuring robustness and guaranteeing a reasonable recognition rate demands a complete monitoring of the body as much as Sensors 2014 , 14 6493 the number of target activities and their diversity increases [ 85 , 86 ] . Thereby , we consider that this study perfectly suits current and , especially , future trends . 6 . Conclusions The activity recognition process consists of several stages , each one of crucial importance . One of these steps is signal segmentation , which is normally performed through a windowing procedure . Despite the importance of selecting an appropriate window size , most designs rely on randomly selected values or ﬁgures used in previous cases of success , which nevertheless could not optimally apply to the particular considered problem . As a consequence , very limited knowledge and consensus exists in this respect . In this work , we have presented an extensive study that analyzes the effects of the windowing process on activity recognition system performance . Several methodologies extensively used in previous works are used for evaluation . From the results , reduced windows ( 2 s or less ) are demonstrated to provide the most accurate detection performance . In fact , the most precise recognizer is obtained for very short windows ( 0 . 25 – 0 . 5 s ) , leading to the perfect recognition of most activities . Contrary to what is often thought , this study demonstrates that large window sizes do not necessarily translate into a better recognition performance . This work is found of utility not only for the sake of research , but for system design purposes . System conﬁguration and design tasks may beneﬁt from the ﬁgures provided as part of this work . A set of guidelines for the windowing process design has been particularly deﬁned for different activity categories and applications . These guidelines are not seen to replace the need for the search of the optimal window size conﬁguration during the design phase , but rather , provide a reference for the activity recognition system designer . The next steps include extending the scope of this study to other activity recognition domains and technologies .
