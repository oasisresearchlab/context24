In designing user studies , we often use compensation strategies to incentivize recruitment . However , compensation can also lead to ethical issues , such as coercion . The CHI community has yet to establish best prac - tices for participant compensation . Through a systematic review of manuscripts at CHI and other associated publication venues , we found high levels of variation in the compensation strategies used within the community and how we report on this aspect of the study methods . A qualitative analysis of justifcations ofered for compensation sheds light into how some researchers are currently contextualizing this practice . This paper provides a description of current compensation strategies and information that can inform the design of compensation strategies in future studies . The fndings may be helpful to generate productive discourse in the HCI com - munity towards the development of best practices for participant compensation in user studies .

HCI draws most notably from computer science , cognitive science , and human factors engineering [ 83 ] , yet continues to grow and evolve , incorpo - rating components of various intersecting domains including social psychology [ 76 ] , visualization [ 1 ] , and library and information sci - ences [ 61 ] . The interdisciplinary nature of our feld also means that our methods and the way we report our methods can vary greatly [ 8 , 9 ] . We have seen increased attention in recent years at under - standing ethical practices and the development of best practices within the HCI community [ 13 , 30 , 102 ] . One common but highly variable and ill - defned aspect of HCI methodology is participant compensation . Compensation for human subjects research involves a series of inherently complex decisions . Research design , participant charac - teristics , regulations , availability of funds , and cultural norms may all factor in to compensation decisions [ 6 ] . Given the complexity of compensation decisions and study design , researchers have unsur - prisingly highlighted inconsistencies in how scientists report on compensation in their manuscripts [ 55 ] . Inconsistencies in partici - pant compensation and compensation reporting have been called out by numerous research communities as problematic [ 92 ] . These inconsistencies risk exacerbating current ethical and replicability issues in science [ 42 ] and is one facet that we could strengthen within our scientifc community . The role of the “user " or “participant " is integral to HCI . Across the various sub - disciplines , research is grounded in how user ( s ) interact with , engage , and utilize various technologies . Participants play a broad set of roles within user studies , including , for example , serving as stakeholders in design processes , providing insights and requirements to inform future design , and taking part in the collection or generation of data [ 100 ] . A search of just the CHI 2020 proceedings within the ACM Digital Library found that 87 . 4 % contained the term “participant . " While other domains like medicine , psychology and education have established best practices when feld of human - computer interaction ( HCI ) is a relatively young CHI ’21 , May 8 – 13 , 2021 , Yokohama , Japan Pater , et al . it comes to compensation levels for certain types of participatio or tasks , there still exists a high level of variability and calls fo creating more standardized , ethical practices . Within HCI , a majority of the compensation research has focuse on aspects like comparing participant responses to micro - incentive [ 54 , 69 ] , new approaches to compensation [ 29 ] , and motivation [ 82 However , there are only a few examples of scholarship focused o analyzing the actual compensation levels , and those are focuse within specifc domains like micropayments [ 69 ] . Even with th critical role of the user within HCI research , there are not standar best practices for reporting on participant compensations nor ho we report this process . In this article , we report on a literature review for four of th major publication venues within HCI over 2018 and 2019 for re search articles that employ user studies as part of their researc methodology . Three key research questions motivated this research • How do HCI researchers provide context or justifcation fo how they compensate research participants ? • What are the patterns for participant compensation withi HCI scholarship ? • Are there standard processes for paying participants ? This research contributes the following to the CHI community 1 ) a meta review of how HCI reports paying participants , 2 ) a quali tative analysis of justifcations of participant compensations , whic allow the community to learn from others in the feld across the var ious disciplines and publication venues , and 3 ) recommendations o how to report participant payment . The goal of this paper is to out line current trends in participant compensation , present potentiall useful rationales that have been used to justify previous compensa tion strategies , recommend a consistent compensation reportin structure , and to call for future research to evaluate compensa tion methods in HCI . What constitutes “ethical” or “appropriate compensation varies across studies based on a range of contextua factors , of which many studies we analyzed did not include suf cient details ( e . g . , time commitment , geographic location ) . Howeve in this paper we take a stance that compensation should be reporte on with sufcient details so that the equity of the compensatio level can be evaluated and so that compensation decisions use within the community are transparent . n r d s ] . n d e d w e - h : r n : - h - n - y - g - " l - r , d n d 2 HOW DO WE DEFINE COMPENSATION LEVELS FOR RESEARCH PARTICIPATION ? In the early 20th century , including remuneration in the form of meals and transportation and even burial costs [ 59 ] . In one of the more notorious studies of its time , Dr . Walter Reed led an experiment in 1900 where Spanish immigrant workers were given $ 100 in gold and free medical care for a Yellow Fever experiment , in addition to another $ 100 if the participant contracted the disease [ 34 ] . Ofering compensation to research participants is a common yet inconsis - tent practice in the United States , used to facilitate recruitment by incentivizing participation [ 38 ] . Research governing bodies usually provide guidance on what goes into compensation strategies . In the United States , the Institu - tional Review Board ( IRB ) is bound by regulations to review both the amount of payment and the proposed method and timing of the United States , paying human subjects “became routine " in compensation to assure that neither are coercive or present undue infuence ( 21 CFR 50 . 20 ) [ 32 ] . Universities often provide overviews of participant compensation including general guidelines , interna - tional research , payment structures , and compensation of profes - sionals [ 75 , 95 , 96 ] . Because of the high variation in research , there are not specifc guidelines of exact levels or compensation schedules for researchers to consult during the design of their research . Some felds with a long history of human - subject research have developed practices that may present useful lessons to the HCI com - munity . The feld of medicine has various documented practices and guidance that outline best practices for participant compen - sation . For example , The NIH Clinical Center reviewed multiple years worth of research studies and found that $ 20 for blood sam - ples , $ 10 for a urine sample and $ 30 for a one - hour survey was average [ 26 ] , which was validated through another independent survey of the feld [ 84 ] . As with many other felds , there is also the potential for high variability in compensation ; for example , MRIs ranged from $ 25 to $ 120 , with variability even present in the same institution [ 23 ] . Another example of highly variable compensation occurred in a series of HIV cure studies , where participant compen - sation ranged from “no payment " to “nearly $ 2 , 000 " [ 47 ] . Another literature review noted that variation was also found within the same research study , with a multi - site research study depicting a variation of $ 840 within it’s own participants [ 39 ] . Psychology is another feld with is a long history of compen - sating participants . Again , there is variability within this domain . However , there are organizations within psychology that give guid - ance on compensation levels for research participants . The NYU Department of Psychology guides that participants should be com - pensated between $ 10 and $ 20 per hour , and , in addition to mone - tary compensation , some studies ofer food and / or free merchandise [ 74 ] . A common practice in psychology departments is recruiting heavily from the college / university community , especially under - graduates . Latterman and Merz found that out of 64 psychology studies they reviewed , 74 % only involved course credit as the form of remuneration [ 57 ] . They also found a large range of compensa - tion from $ 1 to $ 730 , noting that increased monetary value equated to deeper involvement of the participant including multiple inter - actions , increased time , and invasive procedures . Like the medical studies , there are some standards across the literature for certain types of activities , like $ 15 for surveys , $ 25 for interviews and $ 445 for interventional studies [ 84 ] . A multiple regression analysis found that subjects were paid an average of $ 9 . 50 / hour plus an additional $ 12 for each additional task involved in the study [ 57 ] . Within recent HCI literature , studies of participant compensa - tion have focused almost solely on specifc incentive structures and on the gig economy . Musthag et al . found that micro - incentive scheme had high variability and worked best for keeping research participants engaged in high - burden research initiatives [ 69 ] . An - other form of alternative incentive is the “surprise " incentive and the underlying motivation for participation , especially if poten - tial participants are surprised with a higher amount than initially expected [ 31 ] . Amazon Mechanical Turk ( MTurk ) provides an in - teresting platform for analysis , seeing the exponential growth in researchers using this platform for participant recruitment in recent years . Research into self - reported compensation levels of MTurkers fnd that $ 1 - $ 6 USD is the typical hourly wage [ 48 , 62 ] . Hara et al . Standardizing Reporting of Participant Compensation in HCI CHI ’21 , May 8 – 13 , 2021 , Yokohama , Japan conducted a task analysis and found that workers earned an hourly wage of approximately $ 2 / hour , with only 4 % of their sample earn - ing more than the U . S . federal minimum wage of $ 7 . 25 / hour [ 45 ] . Noted within Hara’s research was the lack of reporting of demo - graphics , including location , which would give further insights into the equity of the varying compensation levels based on minimum wages of the various locations of the participants . Follow - up work by this research team found there was a wage gap in that MTurkers in the U . S . on average earn $ 3 . 01 / hour while those in India earn $ 1 . 41 / hour [ 46 ] . The body of this discussion reinforces the asser - tions that , overall , MTurkers are underpaid for their contribution [ 50 ] . With such variation across domains with respect to participant remuneration , and no existing standards or best practices within the HCI domain , we found it imperative to assess how HCI researchers compensated research participants . Because of the interdisciplinary nature of HCI research , we also chose to review multiple venues of HCI research publication to ensure we had a representative collec - tion including diferent sub - communities and research methods . 3 METHODS We conducted a systematic literature review of all 2018 - 2019 manuscripts published in the Association of Computing Machinery ( ACM ) Digital Library associated with the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems ( CHI ) , Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work ( CSCW ) , Conference on Ubiquitous Computing ( Ubicomp / IMWUT ) , and Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology ( UIST ) that included the search term “par - ticipant” . We included these four venues because they represent the top four impact factor publication venues for HCI research . Additionally , they provide a nice variation of HCI - focused research . This resulted in an initial set of 2478 papers . We used the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta - Analyses ( PRISMA ) approach to structure the evaluation of articles identifed in the initial search [ 66 ] PRISMA focuses on ways in which authors can ensure a transparent and complete re - porting of this type of research [ 42 ] . Each paper , including title , abstract , and text was reviewed by a member of the research team . Papers were excluded from the analysis if the study did not involve participant recruitment ( such as observations in a public setting ) or did not include a user study ( such as literature reviews ) . Addition - ally , we set a criteria that only full papers would be analyzed which led to the removal of posters , late breaking work , and demos . We ended with a fnal collection of 1662 papers , describing 2250 unique user studies in the fnal data analysis . There are more unique user studies than research papers as some papers reported on several user studies . Figure 1 shows the process used that resulted in the fnal set of 1662 papers used for analysis . 3 . 1 Categorical Data As the research team reviewed each paper , we developed categorie that allowed us to characterize and compare both the compens tion and reporting . We manually extracted 17 categories whic are listed in table 1 . When a manuscript described multiple studie we separated these activities into distinct rows when the studie s a - h s s Figure 1 : PRISMA Diagram involved diferent participants , payment amounts , vehicles of pay - ment , or payment structures . For all of the categories listed in Table 1 , when a paper included no details about a category , we noted this as “unspecifed . ” To complete these categories for the 2250 studies included in the review , papers were randomly and evenly distributed among the authors to review . The research team met weekly over a six month period to collectively review the data , address open questions , and discuss emerging themes . The researchers used an iterative inductive analysis approach to develop common clusters . For this iterative analysis , the researchers frst independently open coded the dataset , developing their own classifcations . The team then met to review each classifcation schema , discuss diferences , and develop a fnal set of classifcations to be used for each of these categories . The fnal classifcations are listed in Table 1 . This qualitative data analysis allowed for a more standardized classifcation and reporting of the studies included in analysis . 3 . 2 Justifcations / Rationales Qualitative Assessment of Compensation Out of the 2250 user studies , 266 ( 11 . 8 % ) of the studies contained a pecifc rationale or justifcation for the compensation provided to articipants . We captured the justifcation text in the metadata table nd then ran a thematic analysis on this data . Three researchers met o review a subset of the justifcations and create a initial codebook . wo researchers coded a subset of 75 justifcations . The group met gain to discuss codes they felt were missing and to discuss any emaining questions . The fnal code book with defnitions can be ound in Table 2 . Two of the researchers took the code book and pplied them to the entire dataset . There was an overall agreement f 96 . 9 % with a Cohen’s Kappa of 0 . 75 , indicating substantial agree - ent between the two coders . A full breakdown of the analysis per ode is located in Table 3 . spatTarfaomc 3 . 3 Ethical Considerations Within the results , we do not report exact dollar amounts associated ith averages across the feld . This is purposeful in that we do not elieve it is appropriate for this research to be used as a justifcation or what the feld should pay research participants . Rather , we aim wbf CHI ’21 , May 8 – 13 , 2021 , Yokohama , Japan Pater , et al .

Therefore , we elected to focus on ranges of incentives present within the data , payment structures utilized , and the rationale or justifcations given for the compensation levels , with the goal of informing the development of compensation strategies moving forward . highlight trends found within the last several years . Appropriate 4 RESULTS 4 . 1 Reporting Compensation Our tion are reported or not reported within HCI literature . We looked at four primary factors regarding compensation : 1 ) if compensation was provided , 2 ) amount of compensation provided , 3 ) participa - tion duration , and 4 ) mode of payment ( e . g . gift cards , cash , movie tickets , etc . ) [ 6 ] . frst objective was to understand which aspects of compensa - We found that the majority of manuscripts did not report whether or not compensation was provided to study participants ( N = 1303 , 57 . 9 % ) . We identifed only 70 studies ( 3 . 1 % ) that explicitly stated that participants were not compensated . A small number of the manuscripts included a comment that compensation was provided , but did not provide any details . This included studies that noted participants received an “incentive " or “small compensation " without further information ( N = 88 , 3 . 9 % ) . We also looked at the duration of participation , as the amount of time required of the participant can infuence the compensation structure . We identifed 762 manuscripts ( 33 . 9 % ) that did not report participation duration . Finally , we looked for information on the mode of payment and found that 781 manuscripts ( 34 . 7 % ) did not provide information on how compensation was distributed . Looking at these four factors collectively , and accounting for overlap in non - reporting within single studies , we found that 84 . 2 % ( n = 1894 ) of studies did not report on at least one of these Code % agreement Cohen’s Kappa Level of Agreement Difcult to access info 100 . 00 % 1 . 00 Perfect Transportation 99 . 65 % 0 . 95 Almost Perfect Minimum wage 98 . 95 % 0 . 93 Almost Perfect Economically disadvantaged 99 . 65 % 0 . 89 Almost Perfect Food / refreshments 99 . 30 % 0 . 89 Almost Perfect Gratitude / appreciation 98 . 60 % 0 . 85 Almost Perfect Comparison to other research 97 . 55 0 . 82 Almost Perfect Competition / rafe 97 . 2 % 0 . 82 Almost Perfect Expertise 98 . 95 % 0 . 79 Substantial No / lower levels of compensation 95 . 80 % 0 . 72 Substantial $ / time interval 88 . 46 % 0 . 71 Substantial Specifc scheme / payment structure 94 . 06 % 0 . 69 Substantial Funding limitation / barrier 99 . 65 % 0 . 67 Substantial Comparison to pilot study 97 . 90 % 0 . 61 Substantial $ / task or activity 81 . 47 % 0 . 60 Substantial External source of infuence 94 . 76 % 0 . 54 Moderate Assumption by researcher 94 . 41 % 0 . 44 Moderate Code Defnition $ / task or activity Compensation is defned by specifc activities or tasks $ / time interval Compensation is defned by specifc intervals of time No / lower levels of compensation Includes comments about why no compensation was provided or why a lower level of compensation was provided Difcult to access info Includes comments about additional compensation because of the difculty to access specifc information External source of infuence Mentions the infuence of an external source like a funding source or community organization Economically disadvantaged Mentions that participants are low SES or economically disadvantaged Expertise Includes comments about compensation based on expertise or knowledge Minimum wage Mentions minimum wage Food / refreshments Includes providing participants with food or beverages Specifc scheme / payment Includes rationale for varied payments that include task structures and bonuses structure Competition / rafe Mentions rafes or competition for specifc levels of compensation Transportation Mentions compensation for transportation to / from research engagement Assumption by researcher Includes that researcher ( s ) made an assumption with respect to the compensation Gratitude / appreciation Mentions compensation was a “gift " or was in “appreciation " or with “gratitude " Comparison to pilot study Includes comparing current compensation level to that of a pilot study Comparison to other research Includes comparing current compensation level to those of a previous study study Funding limitation / barrier Includes limitations to compensation levels based on funding barriers Standardizing Reporting of Participant Compensation in HCI CHI ’21 , May 8 – 13 , 2021 , Yokohama , Japan Table 2 : Qualitative Code Book - Metadata Table 3 : Qualitative Inter - Rater Reliability factors ( whether compensation was provided , the compen - sation amount , the mode of payment , or the participation duration ) , and thus did not provide sufcient details to understand their compensation structure . 4 . 1 . 1 Rationales / Justifications for Compensation .

Here , we present a thematic analysis of factors that for compensation decisions can be an important step in de - CHI ’21 , May 8 – 13 , 2021 , Yokohama , Japan Pater , et al . infuenced prior compensation strategies . We believe these may provide useful guidance for researchers as they make compensation decisions for future user studies . A total of 286 ( 11 . 2 % ) of papers analyzed had a rationale or jus - tifcation for the level of compensation . Through the qualitative analysis , we identifed six factors that were frequently used to de - termine compensation levels . These factors include : compensation based on past studies or pilot studies , minimum wage , infuences from organizations outside of the research team , participant ex - pertise , existing compensation models , and lack of compensation . Table 4 highlights examples from the dataset of the various types of justifcations and rationales . These rationales provide examples that have been used within the HCI scientifc community in prior studies to make compensation decisions . By including them in the publications , these authors provide additional context for the reader that helps further ground the work , as well as provide key information to those wishing to replicate the research . 4 . 2 Compensation levels Out a monetary compensation to the research participants . The value of compensation ranged from $ 0 . 05 USD to $ 700 . 00 . When taking into consideration participant time as a factor of the research participant , we can only report on 66 . 0 % of these studies . Of those , the hourly compensation ranged from $ 2 . 86 to $ 240 . When looking at this data by publication venue , we found moderate variations ( see Table 5 ) . NOTE : not all compensation was reported in USD . We converted all currencies into USD on 9 / 9 / 2020 . While this is an imperfect practice , as exchange rates are a foating index , it gives some form of normalization , as not all studies reported exact dates / periods when the compensation took place . We looked to see if compensation levels difered by publication venue . Table 5 shows the number of studies included in the analysis , the number of studies that provided compensation , if there was a mention of IRB or ethics committee review , and the monetary ranges . We also looked at the average hourly rate provided to participants . As illustrated in Figure 3 , we found no signifcant diference in hourly compensation rate between venues ( F = . 544 , p = . 695 ) . We did fnd a signifcant correlation between hourly compensa - tion and the primary location of the study ( F = 2 . 815 , p = . 039 ) . Pair - wise comparisons indicate that compensation was higher for studies that took place at participants’ homes compared to online studies ( p = . 022 ) and lab studies ( p = . 045 ) . Figure 4 shows illustrates this diference . There were several compensation vehicles present in the dataset . Table 6 provides an overview of the most common modes of pay - ment with the various ranges in value attached to each . Within the gift card / gift certifcate category , Amazon was the most popular ( 41 . 1 % ) . For those that gave an option , common vehicles included cash , gift cards , mobile credit , and class credit . of the 2250 individual studies we analyzed , 660 ( 29 . 3 % ) reported An overwhelming majority ( 61 . 0 % ) of these did not directly spec - ify how participants received the noted monetary value . 85 . 4 % of this subset provided a currency value or range of currency value but did not stipulate how that value was transferred to the research participant . For the remainder of the unspecifed compensations , authors would report that participants were “compensated , " “paid , " or given “incentives , " “monetary rewards , " or “some compensation . " Additionally , studies that utilize crowd source workers rarely spec - ifed that workers were compensated via the specifc platform’s compensation channel . There was a variety in diferent types of studies . For the $ / hour analysis , these were all studies that provided exact fxed times for specifc types of participant engagement like taking a survey , pro - viding an interview , or completing a task / experiment . However , feld deployment is another type of research engagement where research participation can vary over a longer duration of time . A total of 237 ( 10 . 5 % ) have a duration of participation greater than one week ( 7 days ) . Monetary compensation ranged from $ 4 . 00 to $ 700 . 00 and were transferred to the participant via cash , Visa / Amex gift cards , non - specifed gift cards , gift cards to specifc establish - ments ( Amazon , Tim Hortons , Target ) , bank transfers , and fnancial applications ( e . g . PayPal ) . Non - monetary compensations included course credit , vouchers , movie tickets , mobile credits , technology ( e . g . tablet , ftbit , pedometer ) , and food / beverage . “Gifts " and “to - kens of appreciation " were also provided . Finally , we looked at if and how compensation varied based on whether the study recruited participants who are classifed as a protected class . Based on the legal defnition of protected groups under U . S . Law [ 58 ] and vulnerable populations under the US Of - fce for Human Research Protections [ 35 ] , we defned a protected class as including Pregnant women , Neonates , Prisoners , Children , Individuals with physical disabilities , Individuals with mental dis - abilities or cognitive impairments , Economically disadvantaged , Socially disadvantaged , Terminally ill or very sick , Racial or ethnic minorities , and Institutionalized persons ( for example , persons in correctional facilities , nursing homes or mental health facilities ) . We identifed 332 ( 14 . 8 % ) studies that included a protected class as participants . Of these 332 studies , 109 ( 32 . 8 % ) provided compensa - tion , 10 ( 3 . 0 % ) did not provide compensation , and 213 ( 64 . 2 % ) studies did not report on compensation . When comparing compensation between studies that included a protected class ( N = 109 ) and those that did not ( N = 768 ) , we found that compensation was signifcantly higher for those that included at least one protected class ( t = 2 . 02 , p = . 048 ) . Figure 4 illustrates this diference in compensation .

We identifed nine diferent compensation structures . We describe these below and provide example citations for papers that ft these categories . ( 1 ) Fixed amount - The most common compensation structure among the HCI manuscripts was provided a fxed amount to all participants regardless for how much time was taken for the given task or what was asked of the the participants [ 87 , 108 ] . Figure 4 : Compensation by Protected Class , with standard error bars ( 2 ) Amount per task - We identifed a high volume of manuscripts that provided a small , fxed amount of com - pensation for each task a participant completed . Tasks often consisted of short computer tasks , as is typical with Ama - zon Mechanical Turk studies . Alternatively , other studies provided fxed amounts for completing multiple surveys , participating in multiple interviews , or other in - person user study activities [ 22 , 85 ] . ( 3 ) Amount by time - We identifed a small set of manuscripts that provided participants with a fxed compensation per time period . This most often occurred in longitudinal studies , in which participants were compensated per day or week that they remained involved in the research [ 27 , 105 ] . ( 4 ) Varied by participant type - Varying compensation amounts based on participant characteristics was another payment structure that emerged among the HCI studies . In some cases , studies compensated adults and children dif - ferently . Other studies varied compensation based on the country in which the study was occurring , though it was of - ten unclear if these variations were driven by cultural factors or other reasons specifc to geographic location [ 68 , 94 ] . ( 5 ) Varied by performance - To incentivize optimal partic - ipation , a small number of studies ofered compensation bonuses based on participants’ performance of the study tasks . In most of these studies , the top N performers received an additional payment [ 11 , 12 ] . ( 6 ) Varied by participant expenses - We found that a few studies noted that they compensated participants with a fxed amount and a variable amount based on participants’ trans - portation expenses . While a less common payment structure , we feel this ofers a nice model that researchers could con - sider in future studies [ 14 , 43 ] . ( 7 ) Participant’s choice - In a small number of studies , partic - ipants selected their preferred compensation . For example , student participants could choose between course credit or a monetary payment . We also found a few studies in which CHI ’21 , May 8 – 13 , 2021 , Yokohama , Japan Pater , et al .

[ 81 , 103 ] ( 8 ) Donation - Another less common but interesting payment structure was pledging donations to charity for participation . Often the charities were directly aligned with the research topic , such as a national disease foundation when recruiting participants with that particular diagnosis . [ 67 , 106 ] ( 9 ) Negative reinforcement / penalties - In the fnal payment structure we identifed , researchers used penalties within their compensation structure . This meant that participants could lose a small portion of their compensation for poor performance or inactivity . [ 17 , 65 ] Notably , studies often included combinations of these compen - sation structures . Many studies included a fxed minimum that all participants would receive and then include bonus incentives for completing more tasks or for high performance . In other studies , for example , researchers provided participants with the option to select between a fxed payment amount or a donation to a charity . 5 DISCUSSION This paper presents a comprehensive overview of compensation re - porting and methods within HCI literature over a two - year period . Compensation methods are complex decisions , in which researchers must consider the benefts and potential ethical challenges of com - pensating participants . To support these decisions in future studies , we have presented a comprehensive list of factors reported to stud - ies that detailed their justifcations for their compensation decisions . Refecting on existing practices , we propose a number of recom - mendations to the community , including the consistent reporting of compensation decisions and rationales . 5 . 1 Standardizing the Reporting of Compensation in User Studies In not report any details on compensation . Gathering data on com - pensation was challenging , as there is no standard for reporting compensation , leading to a lack of reporting and inconsistencies in how compensation is reported . Some metadata were commonly reviewing HCI literature , we found the majority of papers do Standardizing Reporting of Participant Compensation in HCI CHI ’21 , May 8 – 13 , 2021 , Yokohama , Japan reported , such as participant numbers and characteristics of the par - ticipant pool . However , many important data were frequently not reported , including compensation amounts , or even if participants were compensated at all . The amount of time participants were engaged in the study and where the research took place were also not frequently reported . This makes it impossible to determine with any certainty what the norms are for participant compensation in HCI research . The lack of reporting is a concern for the community when it comes to replicability of our research . Replicability has garnered much attention both within scientifc communities and media in recent years [ 5 , 18 , 72 ] . The nature of HCI studies – e . g . studying context specifc phenomena , engaging specifc populations – weak - ens , if not eliminates , the ability for studies to be replicated exactly . However , compensation ( generally ) has been highlighted as one aspect of scientifc methods that is under reported but important for addressing ethical and replicability issues in science [ 53 ] . Reporting compensation when using crowdsourced labor mar - ketplaces like Crowdfower or Amazon Mechanical Turk is also a point of concern for several reasons , primarily because of the his - torical exploitation of this labor force [ 62 ] . Leading HCI researchers working in this space have explicitly asked researchers to stop cit - ing their past work as a way to justify the continued underpayment of crowdsourced workers [ 89 ] . It has been noted that these workers often provide signifcant degrees of subject matter expertise , yet usually earn less than the legal minimum wages , have no health benefts , and can be summarily fred for any - to - no reason [ 40 ] . While we have seen calls from the community have discussed pay - ing crowdworkers an ethical amount or at least minimum wage [ 88 ] , there are still still studies taking place within HCI that pay crowdsourced workers well under documented minimum wages . Improving standards for reporting participant compensation would increase transparency , facilitating a better common under - standing of appropriate , ethical compensation . To that end , we recommend that authors report the following components of participant compensation : the amount and form of pay - ment , how long participants were engaged , and where the research took place . 5 . 2 Factors to Consider in Compensation Decisions A rationales . While a small percentage of papers ofered a thorough description of their compensation decisions , these explanations also ofer useful considerations that may be benefcial in the design of future studies . Our review of rationales revealed that the most frequent rationales focused on how participants were paid by the task or factors that lead into why a participant was recruited in the frst place ( e . g . economically disadvantaged , or providing a subject matter expertise that is desired or required ) . The list of rationales provided in Table 2 should not be seen as a defnitive list , but a reference point to start when thinking about justifying a compen - sation strategy . Due to the interdisciplinary nature of our feld , this list could easily be expanded with additional representation of communities like Designing Interactive Systems ( DIS ) or Intelligent User Interfaces ( IUI ) , or any other publication venue not selected contribution of this work is an evaluation of compensation design for this analysis . By providing a rationale , the authors not only give the readers more confdence in the thought and consideration that went into the design of the compensation strategy , but also provide a way to teach the next generation of research scientists about the nuance and design that go into the various compensation strategies . We recommend that authors include justifcations or rationales for compensation decisions . This was a motiva - tion for including Table 4 and we encourage readers to use this as a reference point for considering possible factors in the decision making process and exemplars of how our community has reported on these past decisions . 5 . 2 . 1 The Importance of Cultural Contexts . Another key factor that should be taken into consideration when determining participant payments are the local variations in compensation with regards to customs and what is considered a living or minimum wage . This was a primary consideration in our decision to not report out on average payments but to provide a range . It would be impossible to provide a non - biased recommended per / hour participant rate for the many reasons that have previously been discussed . Additionally , we included a variety of best practices from non - U . S . and European studies . For example , in the justifcations for minimum wage , we made sure to highlight examples from research settings in rural India , crowd workers from multiple countries , and U . S . - based partic - ipants . Additionally , we highlighted justifcations that took cultural and regional contexts within other categories like infuences of organizations outside of the research team , expertise , and in non - monetary compensations which included food and beverages . We believe that encouraging a standardization in reporting practices which would give more transparency and allow for readers and reviewers to make more informed decisions with regards to the fairness of the compensation is the most practical and unbiased path forward . 5 . 3 The Pros and Cons of Direct Compensation to Research Participants While compensate participants , we recognize that there are many cases in which compensating participants for their involvement in re - search would be inappropriate . Per the FDA’s guidance document for clinical research , providing incentive payments for research can , without careful consideration , tip the scales ethically and limit the ability for participants to voluntarily ofer consent [ 33 ] . As such , there is ethical precedent for not compensating research subjects , due in part to the potential for incentives to create bias in studies , especially when the impact of the amount or vehicle of compen - sation is not considered . Any payment to an individual in a study could engender positive feelings that colludes feedback and leads to false or overly - optimistic outcomes . Lack of compensation can be somewhat standard within certain felds or settings , such as health care . One study mentioned that the direct compensation of clinician participants was not allowable per the IRB [ 78 ] . We also noted an example in our dataset of compensa - tion being declined by clinicians who stated they would rather the funding be spent on further research and development [ 52 ] . While some clinical research trials compensate participants quite well , there are high levels of “volunteering " that takes place within these we primarily report on details related to studies that did CHI ’21 , May 8 – 13 , 2021 , Yokohama , Japan Pater , et al . trials . This type of participation is often characterized as having additional meaning to the participant because of a personal interest in science , altruistic overtures of contributing to improvements of medical care , or supporting specifc diseases or illnesses that are meaningful due to a personal or shared experience [ 15 ] . The practice of not compensating research participants monetar - ily is also quite common within research that recruits from colleges and universities . Within our own dataset , we found many instances of students not being compensated or where compensation was defned as credit ( or extra credit ) for the class where the research took place . Overall , the ethical issues associated with compensation are com - plex and often dependent on specifc factors unique to a certain study . There can be no blanket statement made regarding what con - stitutes ethical compensation , other than that it must be carefully considered on an individual basis . IRBs often facilitate this process via establishing compensation policies specifc to their institution and / or reviewing and approving researchers’ proposed compensa - tion structure . This represents a critical step in the research process that was reported relatively rarely in our dataset – slightly over a quarter of the papers we reviewed mentioned an IRB or other ethics review , and far fewer mentioned this in relation to compensation or lack thereof . Providing more transparency related to these types of decisions will both facilitate greater replicability as well as provide greater clarity on general standards and practices in the broad , evolving feld of HCI . Given the strong connection between compensation methods and ethical research practices , we believe there will be many cases in which researchers opt not to compensate par - ticipation , whether on an individual or institutional policy basis . Such decisions should be normalized within the com - munity and reported within study manuscripts . were the most popular , with 41 % of those being specifcally for Amazon . For the class credit that was denoted , there were no mon - etary values established for this compensation . This is important because not all colleges / universities have the same monetary value attached to one course credit . For studies to be replicated or evalu - ated for ethical practices or fairness , greater context is needed in HCI study methods sections , especially with respect to the vehicles used to provide compensation to study participants . A surprisingly low number of studies mentioned any type of review by an ethics review board or committee . CHI , CSCW , and UBICOMP / IMWUT were in similar ranges ( 25 - 39 % ) while UIST stood out as an outlier ( 10 % ) . While the number of studies that were actually received an ethics review was likely much higher , it was not a standard to report on this metric in research where a user study was utilized as part of the research methodology . The U . S . Ofce of Human Research Protections clearly articulates the need for institutional review when human subjects are involved [ 73 ] , so the lack of docu - mentation points to inconsistency in fullness of reporting methods . Again , this could be addressed during review processes or during training within our individual university and industry programs and culture . 6 OPPORTUNITIES FOR FUTURE WORK In gaps within HCI research to evaluate the efects of these compen - sation methods . Below we outline two possible paths forward to address these gaps . addition to the recommendations provided above , we also see 6 . 1 Involving Participants in Compensation Decisions In that several studies either gave participants choices related to their compensation or involved relevant stakeholders during study de - sign to determine compensation vehicle or amount . For example , Lascau et al . [ 56 ] , who paid their participants ( Amazon Mechanical Turk workers ) a rate that worked out to approximately $ 16 per hour , engaged several experienced Turkers directly to establish a compensation rate validated by representatives of the community . Similarly , Stähli et al . utilized “subject matter experts " in a pre - study to aid in the design of their main study ; their compensation consisted of a drawing for one of three prizes ( headphones and two diferent vouchers ) , which were selected with the help of these subject matter experts who , like the main participants , were pilots [ 91 ] . In asking what type of prizes to give out , the researchers may have gained insight they did not have previously toward which gifts would be of particular use to someone in this feld . Nanavati et al . described the importance of ensuring their com - munities of study received “tangible , desired benefts " from their feldwork , including “using participatory methods during technol - ogy development ; leaving the technology and simple documenta - tion with multiple school afliates ; leaving the computers virus - free and with anti - virus software ; and generally making ourselves avail - able to help with any queries during and after the feldwork " [ 71 ] . Additionally , some studies noted difering compensation vehicles across participants [ 3 , 19 , 25 , 28 , 63 , 86 , 98 , 103 , 107 ] . However , these studies did not report whether the choices of compensation vehicles our analysis of payment structures and justifcations , we noted 5 . 4 Trends Across the Venues The teresting trends . At the outset of this research , it was thought that several of the venues might share similarities since there is some overlap between the venues and the types of research that are pre - sented . When one looks at the metric of participants were provided compensation , all of the venues were in a similar range ( 34 - 41 % ) . This convergence highlights the consistency across the HCI venues . However , this raises questions regarding the levels of research where there is lack of compensation ( voluntary ) or the more com - mon lack of reporting compensation in the feld . One way to address the lack of reporting is to enhance the reviewing process . While training individual reviewers on what to look for when reporting compensation is possible , there are other , less resource intensive ways to provide guidance . To that point , we recommend a best practice guide for new reviewers could be produced by each venue or the SIG itself , or guidance could be provided to the Associate Chairs ( ACs ) during the review process . Another trend observed was the variability in the various types of compensation vehicles reported . Again , this is an area where authors could be more transparent in how participants are paid . As noted , 61 % did not directly specify how participants received monetary values . For those that did specify , gift cards / certifcates data presented in the previous section highlights several in - Standardizing Reporting of Participant Compensation in HCI CHI ’21 , May 8 – 13 , 2021 , Yokohama , Japan were derived from the participants or if they were determined by the researchers , IRB , or some other external factor . Providing more clarity with regard to these types of diferences in payment structure provides a basis for other researchers to make similar decisions in their own related work . Our analysis of the rationales provided in this dataset provide critical information across a range of factors that could be used by the HCI community in future work . Without knowing it or not , the mode of compensation is of - ten implicitly biased . A common form of payment is an Amazon gift card . It is assumed that because Amazon is a virtual market - place , this form of payment would be benefcial to all participants . However , what this doesn’t take into consideration is the partic - ipant’s orientation to Amazon . It is possible that the participant does not support the company , and thus the compensation has less value to them than another participant that does not have that orientation . By adding in a more action - oriented approach of asking the participant how they want to be compensated , the community could further reduce implicit biases and share a small power dynamic with the participant . Therefore , another recommen - dation includes : We contend that involving participants more meaningfully into compensation decisions warrants further attention within the HCI community . Given the increased use of participatory and action research methods within HCI studies [ 20 , 90 ] , we believe there are under - explored ways in which we can involve communities , organization , and participants in these com - plex decisions that provides them greater voice in these important methodological decisions . 6 . 2 Evaluating Compensation Methods In addition to fnding overall low reporting of compensation strate - gies , we also found very few studies that evaluated how compensa - tion infuenced participants or study objectives . Notably , one study [ 41 ] did ask participants their perspectives on the compensation in an exit survey , while another study looked at how a “a loss aver - sion incentive protocol " infuenced behavior [ 4 ] . We see a clear opportunity for HCI research that focuses on compensation evaluation methods . Numerous questions have yet to be explored in our feld , such as : How are diferent incentive structures viewed by various communities ? When do compensations become coercive in user studies ? and How do diferent method variables infuence enrollment and performance ? While we may be able to draw from research in other felds , HCI researchers are well positioned to explore the in - fuence of compensation on methods that are well - established and consistently used within the community , such as user - centered and participatory design sessions , online and laboratory experiments of novel interfaces , and technology deployments . 7 LIMITATIONS This research is limited by the sample of papers we chose for anal - ysis . We sampled a subset of the HCI community : CHI , CSCW , IMWUT , and UIST . Though these four conference proceedings constitute a signifcant proportion of HCI research , the list is not exhaustive . Additionally , our sample is a snapshot of these proceed - ings covering two years ( 2018 - 2019 ) . It is possible that there are meaningful changes in both compensation and how compensation is reported over time , which would cause bias in our results . Future work ample , COVID - 19 may afect compensation structures ; future ork might explore how compensation changes as more research conducted remotely . It was not possible to automatically extract data in the analysis this paper , as there is no standardized method for reporting rticipants and compensation . All data used in this analysis were nerated manually , which could introduce errors . As reported , ere was strong agreement across the coders indicated via the ter - rater reliability intervals . An additional limitation of this research is that it relies on self - ported data [ 9 ] . Paper authors described their own payments , rticipants , and methods . This likely introduces some inaccuracies to the analysis . As Caine et al . points out , there is likely some consistency between diferent authors’ and communities’ def - itions of various methods . For example , a study that might be ferred to as an ethnography in HCI , might not be accepted as an hnography in anthropology [ 9 ] . could investigate longitudinal changes in compensation . For exwis ofpagethin repainininreet 8 CONCLUSION The systematic review presented in this paper describes current articipant compensation practices within the feld of HCI . After viewing 2250 unique user studies , found within 1662 manuscripts , e have synthesized and categorized current approaches to ofer - g participant remuneration and the associated justifcation for aying or not paying study subjects . The fndings presented in this anuscript may inspire HCI research scientists as they design user tudies to develop a comprehensive plan for their compensation trategy and include their strategy in study dissemination artifacts . ey components of describing a compensation strategy include : hat considerations went into the calculation of payment amount , ow the compensation was transferred to the participant , and any ontextual details that will give the reader a deeper understanding f this process and decision making . Normalizing the practice of porting compensation will further strengthen evolving method - logical standards and ethical practices in research design within e feld of HCI . prewinpmssKwhcoreoth ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We would like to thank the members of the Parkview Heath Services and Informatics Research Lab and the Parkview Research Center for their support of this efort .
