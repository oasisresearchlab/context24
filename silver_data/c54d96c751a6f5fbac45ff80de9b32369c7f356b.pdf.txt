Using the Ambiguous Sorting Task ( AST ) , in which domain information competes with causal patterns , we previously found that science experts spontaneously noticed and sorted by causal patterns such as positive feedback , while novices sorted pri - marily by content domain . We investigated two kinds of learning experiences that we claim are needed to achieve high ﬂuency in detecting key cross - domain patterns . We found that direct explication of example phenomena increased people’s accuracy in depicting the examples , but did not increase sensitivity to the causal patterns in new examples . How - ever , analogical comparison between parallel examples did lead to greater propensity to detect the causal patterns across diverse examples . Combining within - example explication with between - example alignment led to the greatest gains in generalized sensitivity to causal patterns . (cid:2) 2015 Elsevier B . V . All rights reserved . An important and understudied aspect of expertise is the ability to spontaneously notice key relational patterns in the ﬂow of experience . For example , the Swiss inventor George de Mestral developed the idea of Velcro when he and his dog returned from an Alpen hike with masses of burrs in their clothes and fur . During the tedious process of removing the burrs , he began to focus on their extraor - dinary clinging power . After examining the burrs with a microscope , he came up with the idea for a reversible fas - tener , with stiff hooks ( like the burrs ) on one side and soft loops ( like fur or fabric ) on the other side . This ability to see beyond the routine irritation of dealing with burrs to a valuable insight suggests a creative mind at work . But it also underlines the importance of a prepared mind . De Mestral was a trained engineer , working in the machine shop of an engineering company and pursuing his own inventions on the side . ( He received a patent for a toy air - plane at the age of 12 ) . His amassed experience in how things work gave him a rich internal vocabulary with which to interpret causal patterns that on the surface bear little resemblance to his everyday work . Our question here is how people acquire generalized sensitivity to key causal patterns . We focus on causal pat - terns because of the importance and pervasiveness of cau - sality in human cogition ( Ahn , Kim , Lassaline , & Dennis , 2000 ; Mackie , 1980 ; Sloman , 2005 ) . Having an abstract understanding of causal structure allows for deep connec - tions to be made across domains . For example , both the melting of polar icecaps and the growth of economic pric - ing bubbles are governed by a positive feedback causal structure . An understanding of causal structure is critical for explanation and prediction ( e . g . , Lombrozo & Carey , 2006 ; Sloman , 2005 ; Thagard , 1989 ) .

For this reason , causal knowledge and reasoning has been a focus of cognitive science from the outset ( de Kleer & Brown , 1981 ; Forbus , 1984 ; Hayes , 1979 ) . There has been extensive research on how causal knowledge is repre - sented , using formalisms such as qualitative process mod - els ( Forbus , 1985 ; Forbus , Nielsen , & Faltings , 1991 ) or causal Bayesian networks ( e . g . , Gopnik et al . , 2004 ; Pearl , 2000 ; Waldmann , Hagmayer , & Blaisdell , 2006 ) . Empirical work on causality has examined how people determine the causal structure of a particular domain or phenomenon . While people typically ﬁnd it quite difﬁcult to infer complex causal patterns purely from observation ( e . g . , Lagnado & Sloman , 2004 ; Steyvers , Tenenbaum , Wagenmakers , & Blum , 2003 ) , this research has revealed kinds of experiences that lead people to infer causal rela - tionships within a domain . These include being exposed to particular kinds of statistical relations among variables ( Cheng , 2000 ) , through direct causal interventions ( e . g . , Hagmayer , Sloman , Lagnado , & Waldmann , 2007 ) or to evi - dence of causal mechanisms ( Ahn & Kalish , 2000 ; Ahn , Kalish , Medin , & Gelman , 1995 ; Lagnado , Waldmann , Hagmayer , & Sloman , 2007 ; Rehder & Hastie , 2001 ) , and engaging in self - explanation ( Chi , de Leeuw , Chiu , & LaVancher , 1994 ; Lombrozo , 2010 ) or counter - factual rea - soning ( e . g . , Harris , German , & Mills , 1996 ) . Our focus here is on different . Instead of examining how people learn and use the causal relations that govern a par - ticular phenomenon , we ask how people learn abstract cat - egories of causal systems that apply across domains and phenomena . In our prior work we developed a sorting task aimed at assessing people’s propensity to notice key causal patterns amidst competing information ( Rottman , Gentner , & Goldwater , 2012 ) . In this task , the Ambiguous Sorting Task ( AST ) , subjects are asked to sort descriptions of causal phenomena into categories . They are given an array of ﬁve ‘seed cards’ to use in sorting ( as well as an ‘‘Other’’ category ) . Each of the ﬁve seed cards depicts a dif - ferent causal system and a different content domain from the others . This means that subjects are free to sort either by causal structure or by content domain . Likewise , the phenomena descriptions they are asked to sort vary both in their content domain ( biology , economics , etc . ) and in their causal structure ( positive feedback , causal chain , etc . ) . ( see Table 1 for the entire list . ) The idea here is that people can achieve a successful sort simply by attending to the relatively obvious domain - level commonalities ; thus , there is no need to seek some other sorting principle . However , if people spontaneously notice the causal com - monalities , they may choose to use these instead . To discover whether ﬂuent knowledge of abstract cau - sal patterns varies with expertise , we gave the AST to advanced physical science students and to social science students . There were two results of interest . First , students in social science and economics sorted primarily by con - tent domain – evidence that the causal patterns were not obvious even to college students . Second , advanced physical science students – many of whom had taken courses in multiple science disciplines – sorted primarily by causal system – evidence that ﬂuent perception of cau - sal patterns increases with expertise ( Rottman et al . , 2012 ; and see Chi , Feltovich , & Glaser , 1981 for a similar result ) . To analogize to the de Mestral example , there was a shift from focusing on the domain level ( removing burrs ) to focusing on a cross - domain abstract principle ( achieving an adhesive connection ) . Our goal in the present research is to understand how people come to be sensitive to abstract causal patterns . We hypothesize that at least two kinds of learning experi - ences are needed for forming abstract causal categories . The ﬁrst is experience and instruction on particular causal phenomena , as in much of the prior research on causal learning . Learning the causal structure of particular cases is important , but we suggest that by itself it is not enough . The second important contributor is a way to form abstract causal representations that apply across domains . We sug - gest that analogical comparison of cases in which the same causal system applies can achieve such abstractions . These two contributors operate in different ways . The ﬁrst contributor , encountering causal explanations for spe - ciﬁc phenomena , seems likely to improve causal under - standing of speciﬁc phenomena . But by itself it is unlikely to promote general causal abstractions . Rather , we hypothesize that comparing analogous phenomena from different domains is critical in promoting abstraction of the common causal structure . There is considerable prior evidence consistent with the idea that analogical comparison highlights common relations through a pro - cess of structural alignment ( Falkenhainer , Forbus , & Gentner , 1989 ; Gentner & Markman , 1997 ) , and that such an alignment permits learners to notice the common struc - ture , which can then be applied more broadly . The idea that analogical comparison promotes transfer from speciﬁc learning contexts has received support from research with adults ( Gick & Holyoak , 1983 ; Goldwater & Markman , 2011 ; Kurtz , Boukrina , & Gentner , 2013 ) and children ( Christie & Gentner , 2010 ; Gentner , Anggoro , & Klibanoff , 2011 ) and by studies in educational contexts ( Gentner , Loewenstein , & Thompson , 2003 ; Klahr & Chen , 2011 ; Rittle - Johnson & Star , 2009 ) . However , although these studies show that analogical comparison can improve transfer , in general it is not clear that it does so via abstracting the common structure . Ana - logical comparison can also improve the individual case representations , and this in itself could improve transfer ( e . g . Gary , Wood , & Pillinger , 2012 ) . Because our study includes a separate ( and prior ) assessment of the accuracy of the case representations , as described below , we can test whether there are effects of comparison on abstraction over and above its effects on representation accuracy . Thus , we hypothesize that both causal explication and structural alignment will lead to increased sensitivity to causal structure , but for different reasons . Causal explica - tion of the training examples will lead to better represen - tation of the causal structure of the individual examples . Structural alignment of training examples will lead to abstraction of the causal pattern , and therefore to increased ability to perceive that pattern in other phenom - ena . Based on this reasoning , a further prediction is that 138 M . B . Goldwater , D . Gentner / Cognition 137 ( 2015 ) 137 – 153 combining the two processes will be more effective than either alone . In the current research , we examined four causal sys - tem categories : common cause , common effect , causal chain , and positive feedback 2 ( see Table 1 ) . The basic idea in this study was to give people training on examples of the four causal systems discussed above and then compare their per - formance on a version of the Ambiguous Sorting Task ( AST ) with that of people who had received no training . In the training , we independently varied two kinds of experience : whether people received causal explications of the training examples , and whether they were encouraged to compare and align pairs of examples . This led to four between - sub - jects training conditions : both explication and alignment ; explication but not alignment ; alignment but no explication ; and neither explication nor alignment . The training set for all four training conditions consisted of eight training exam - ples – two each from each of the four causal system catego - ries ( positive feedback , causal chain , common cause , and common effect ) . One example was always from electrical engineering and the other , from political history . We manipulated Explication as follows . In the Explica - tion condition , each of the eight training examples was accompanied by a statement of the abstract causal schema ( such as positive feedback ) and a detailed explication of how the component events of the phenomenon ﬁt into the roles of the causal schema . We contrasted this with simply receiving the label for the causal schema . ( See Table 2 for an example . ) After each training example , subjects were asked to draw a diagram depicting the causal structure of the phenomenon . This allowed us to gauge their understanding of the examples prior to engaging in the Alignment task . These groups were now further divided : half received Alignment instructions , and half did not ( see Fig . 1 ) . Those in the Alignment condition were asked to compare pairs of training examples that had the same causal system but were from different content domains . To encourage a deep structural alignment , we adopted a task used by Kurtz , Miao , and Gentner ( 2001 ) . Subjects ﬁrst wrote what the two phenomena had in common , and then were asked to state the correspondences they perceived . Importantly , the Alignment manipulation occurred after subjects had read and diagrammed the eight training examples . Thus , half the subjects had received explications along with the examples and half had received only the examples . In addition to the four training conditions , there was a No Training control condition , in which subjects simply performed the sorting task . All ﬁve groups – trained and untrained – performed the same AST at the end . Thus , the design of Experiment 1 was 2 ( Explication vs . Label Only ) (cid:2) 2 ( Alignment vs . No Alignment ) + 1 ( No Training ) ( see Fig . 1 ) , with all variables manipulated between subjects . The key dependent measure was performance on a ver - sion of the Rottman et al . ( 2012 ) Ambiguous Sorting Task . 3 Table 1 Deﬁnitions and examples of ﬁve causal system categories from Rottman et al . ( 2012 ) . Negative feedback was not used in the current experiments . Causal system Deﬁnition Example Common effect Many factors cause one effect Economics : The Cost - of - Living Index is a measure of the cost of basic necessities in a particular city or country . Cost - of - Living is inﬂuenced by factors such as inﬂation , the price of consumer goods , and the local and federal tax rate . Because some cities are more expensive than others , companies will use the Cost - of - Living in part to determine salaries Common cause One factor causes multiple effects Biology : In the human body , an allergic reaction can trigger inﬂammation , rash , asthmatic attack , and typical cold - like symptoms . This is why allergies can be so annoying ! The use of an anti - histamine medication can signiﬁcantly improve many of these symptoms Causal chain One causal factor X leads to an effect Y which in turns causes effect Z and so on Mechanical engineering : The powertrain in cars is the system that transfers energy generated by the motor into turning the wheels . The motor turns gears in the gearbox which rotate the driveshaft which rotates the wheels . When a car is in neutral , no gears are engaged , and thus no power is transferred from the motor Positive feedback The output of a causal system ( e . g . , wherein X increases Y which increases Z ) is then fed back into the system and further increases the original factor X such that the increasing of each factor goes on indeﬁnitely Environmental science : In the process of global warming , as the temperature of the earth rises , polar ice begins to melt . Water absorbs more heat from sunlight than ice . Consequently , as ice is turned into water , the temperature of the earth begins to rise even faster which in turn leads to increased ice - melt Negative feedback The output of a causal system is then fed back into the system , and decreases the original factor such that the system reaches equilibrium Electrical engineering : A thermostat works by measuring temperature and turning on or off a furnace or air conditioner to reach a desired temperature . If the temperature is too cold , the thermostat will turn on the furnace until it becomes warm enough . Likewise , the thermostat on an air conditioner turns on when the house is too warm 2 We omitted negative feedback for reasons of design . 3 Because one domain ( electrical engineering ) was used in the training materials , there were only four seed cards instead of ﬁve as in the Rottman et al . study . M . B . Goldwater , D . Gentner / Cognition 137 ( 2015 ) 137 – 153 139 As in the original AST described above , subjects sorted a set of unlabeled examples into categories deﬁned by a set of seed cards that differed both in causal structure and in con - tent domain . Because this task allows people to sort either by causal patterns or by content domain ( a highly salient dimension ) , it serves as an indication of people’s sensitivity to causal structure . The key question is whether our training will lead to greater sensitivity to causal structure , and if so , how . To understand the speciﬁc roles of explication and alignment , we included a further dependent measure : per - formance in sketching the causal diagrams . Because these are drawn after subjects have read the training examples , but before the alignment manipulation , they allow us to ask whether receiving explication of the causal schemas ( vs . causal labels only ) increases subjects’ accuracy in depicting the causal structure of the training examples , how the accuracy of the individual examples inﬂuences per - formance on the sorting task , and whether alignment improves causal sorting even for participants with accurate causal models . To review , for Experiment 1a we hypothesize that both explication and structural alignment will lead to increased causal sorting , as compared to the No Training condition , but for different reasons . Causal explication of the training examples will lead to better representation of the causal structure of the examples , as assessed by the accuracy of the causal diagrams ; and structural alignment of training examples will lead to abstraction of the causal pattern , and therefore to increased ability to perceive that pattern in other phenomena – over and above having correct cau - sal understanding of the individual examples . Experiment 1b then evaluates whether the diagramming task itself inﬂuences the results . 4 1 . Experiment 1 1 . 1 . Methods 1 . 1 . 1 . Subjects Ninety - seven Northwestern University undergraduates participated for course credit : 20 in the No Training group , 20 in the Explication & Alignment condition , and 19 in each of the other three training conditions . The causal diagrams of two subjects were lost , so are excluded from analyses concerning the diagrams . This sample size was based on that used by Rottman et al . ( 2012 ) . That study compared 12 physical science majors to 32 physical science novices and was able to successfully resolve effects . Thus , we used the average of their group numbers for each of our conditions . 1 . 1 . 2 . Materials Ambiguous Sorting Task . The materials for the AST were 16 example phenomena , composing a matrix of four causal systems ( positive feedback , causal chain , common cause , and common effect ) crossed with four content domains 5 ( biology , economics , environmental science , and mechanical engineering ) ( see Fig . 2 ) . These examples were taken from Rottman et al . ’s ( 2012 ) study and their development and cal - ibration is described in full there . By design , examples from the same domain had more lexical similarity than examples from the same causal system , and this was conﬁrmed by their average pairwise LSA similarity scores . Training . Eight additional examples were used in train - ing – four from electrical engineering ( one illustrating each of the causal systems ) and likewise four from political his - tory . The four electrical engineering examples were taken from Rottman et al . ( 2012 ) ; the four examples from polit - ical history were developed for this study . 1 . 1 . 3 . Procedure Fig . 1 displays the design and ﬂow of the experimental procedure . In the No Training condition , subjects simply Table 2 Example of a training phenomenon description ( Electrical Engineering , Positive Feedback ) . In the Label condition , shown at top , subjects were given only the causal system label . In the Explication condition ( bottom ) , subjects saw the causal system label , a statement of the causal schema and a description of how the roles of the schema are bound to parts of the phenomenon . Audio feedback occurs when a microphone is placed too close to a speaker . Any noise that the microphone picks up is sent to an ampliﬁer and then played through the speaker at a higher volume . The microphone then picks up the louder noise and sends it back to the ampliﬁer and then onto speakers even louder . This can lead to a very loud squealing This is an example of a positive feedback system Audio feedback occurs when a microphone is placed too close to a speaker . Any noise that the microphone picks up is sent to an ampliﬁer and then played through the speaker at a higher volume . The microphone then picks up the louder noise and sends it back to the ampliﬁer and then onto speakers even louder . This can lead to a very loud squealing This is an example of a positive feedback system . In a positive feedback system each causal factor increases the next causal factor and cycles back to increase an earlier causal factor . So , each causal factor both increases the others and is increased by them . In this example , the microphone is the ﬁrst causal factor and it sends sound to the ampliﬁer , a second causal factor , which ampliﬁes and sends the sound to the speaker , resulting in the sound being played at an increased volume . But the speaker is also a cause because it sends this louder sound back to the microphone . The microphone then sends it to the ampliﬁer , and so on 4 We note that this method leaves open the possibility that our comparison task simply acts to alert participants to the relevance of causal information in this study – that is , it acts as a kind of demand characteristic . In addition , Experiment 1a does not rule out that simply revisiting the examples ( without structural alignment ) aids learning . We address these possibilities in Experiment 2 . 5 We used a 4 (cid:2) 4 matrix of Causal system (cid:2) Content domain , instead of a 5 (cid:2) 5 matrix as in Rottman et al . ’s study , and 16 cards to be sorted instead of 20 . This was done so that we could use one of the original ﬁve domains ( Electrical Engineering ) as a training domain . 140 M . B . Goldwater , D . Gentner / Cognition 137 ( 2015 ) 137 – 153 performed the Ambiguous Sorting Task . In the four training conditions , subjects went through training packets prior to performing the AST . Training . The four training groups were ﬁrst given the instructions ‘‘You will read a series of descriptions , and you will sketch a causal graph for each one . Causal graphs depict the cause and effect relationships in the description . . . . ’’ They were given two simple examples : ‘‘Smoking increases the risk of lung cancer’’ and ‘‘Fluoride prevents cavities , ’’ each with the corresponding causal diagram ( see Fig . 3 ) . They then received the training packet : eight brief descriptions of phenomena – four from electrical engineering followed by four from political history . Each training example was given on its own page . Below the example description , the causal system label was given : e . g . , ‘‘This is an example of a positive feedback system . ’’ All four training groups received these labels . In addition , those in Explication condition received an explication of the example that showed how the causal schema ﬁt the particular example and how the example links to the cau - sal roles in the schema ( see Table 2 ) . For all subjects , the bottom half of each page was blank , leaving space for the causal diagram . For the two No Alignment groups , these eight pages completed the training packet . For the two Alignment groups , these eight pages were followed by four pages containing pairs of ( previously seen ) example phenomena – one from electrical engineer - ing and political history – for subjects to align . The two examples shared a common causal system , though this was not mentioned . Each page asked what the two phe - nomena had in common , with a blank space below for the response . In addition , subjects were asked to complete a two - column table . One column listed the components of one example ; the subject’s task was to ﬁll in the corre - sponding components of the other example . Sorting . The procedure for the AST was adapted from that of Rottman et al . ( 2012 ) . Each of the 16 phenomena to be sorted was printed on a ﬁle card . On the table before the subject there were four columns headed by the seed cards ( the four yellow cells in Fig . 2 ) , plus one column labeled ‘‘Other . ’’ Subjects were asked ﬁrst to read the seed cards , and then to sort the other 12 cards into the columns ‘‘based on how well the description on the card goes with the initial card’’ heading each column . They could also place a card into the ‘‘Other’’ column if they did not think it ﬁtted with any of the seed cards . Because our goal was to pit the two sorting strategies ( content domain and causal system ) against one another , the four seed cards each differed from one another both in content domain and in causal category . Thus , as in Rottman et al . ( 2012 ) , the columns could be taken to repre - sent four different domains or four different causal sys - tems , or some mixture of the two . See Table 3 for how two example seed cards can be matched with other cards based on either content domain or causal system . The 12 cards to be sorted were arranged in a semi - random order , with half the subjects receiving the reverse order . There was no time limit ; subjects were told that they could work with the cards in any order and could rearrange previously sorted cards . After sorting all 12 cards , subjects were asked to con - sider alternate sorting strategies and then to re - sort the examples . This was done to allow subjects to display sen - sitivity to both the causal similarities and the domain sim - ilarities . In particular , we were concerned that the deliberate ambiguity of the sorting task could result in underestimating causal knowledge . For example , subjects might recognize both causal similarities and domain simi - larities , but interpret the task to be about domain similar - ities . The second sort allowed subjects an opportunity to display both kinds of knowledge . 1 . 2 . Results We ﬁrst consider the data from the ﬁrst sorting . Each of the 12 cards ( one ‘‘sorting’’ ) was coded according to whether it matched the seed card in its column by content domain or by causal system , or not at all . Overall , the aver - age proportion of cards sorted into the ‘‘other’’ column or into a column that did not match the seed card either in domain or in causal system was . 27 . This did not differ reli - ably among the ﬁve groups ( including the No Training group ) . Error analysis . To further understand participants’ strat - egies , we asked whether some causal categories were par - ticularly confusable with one another . To do so , we analyzed their miss - sorts : cases in which a card was sorted in a column that differed from it both in causal category Full Explication + Causal System Label Causal System Label Only DrawCausalDiagram Comparison : Align Pairs of TrainingExamples No Comparison : No Further Study Test : Sort16 New Examples No Training For Eight Training Examples Fig . 1 . Experiment 1a : design and experimental ﬂow . M . B . Goldwater , D . Gentner / Cognition 137 ( 2015 ) 137 – 153 141 and in domain . There were six possible kinds of causal sys - tem miss - sorts ( disregarding which card was the seed and which was the exemplar to be sorted ) . As shown in Table 4 , the frequencies were not distributed randomly , v 2 ( 5 ) = 52 . 9 , p < . 001 ; over half the miss - sorts were group - ing a causal chain phenomenon with either a positive feed - back or a common effect phenomenon . We next compared the rate of causal sorting between the training conditions and the No Training control . The Explication / Alignment ( M = . 62 ) , Explication / No - Align - ment ( M = . 37 ) , and Label - Only / Alignment ( M = . 37 ) condi - tions all showed more causal sorting than the No Training group ( M = . 14 ) all t ’s > 2 . 5 , all p ’s < . 05 , all d ’s > . 90 . 6 The Label - Only / No - Alignment ( M = . 29 ) condition did not differ signiﬁcantly from the No Training group t ( 37 ) = 1 . 84 , p = . 07 , d = . 60 . We now turn to the key ﬁndings : the rate of causal sort - ing across training conditions ( Fig . 4 ) . A 2 ( Explication vs . Label - Only ) (cid:2) 2 ( Alignment vs . No - Alignment ) indepen - dent samples ANOVA revealed main effects of Explication , f ( 1 , 73 ) = 5 . 26 , p < . 05 , g 2 p = . 067 , and Alignment , f ( 1 , 73 ) = 5 . 0 , p < . 05 , g 2 p = . 064 , but no interaction , f ( 1 , 73 ) = 1 . 15 , p > . 25 , g 2 p = . 016 . Planned comparison t - tests reveal that , as predicted , the Explication / Alignment group showed the highest rate of causal sorting , signiﬁcantly greater than that of the other three training groups , all t ’s > 2 . 25 , all p ’s < . 05 , all d ’s > . 70 . 7 Neither Explication nor Alignment by itself gave a reliable boost above the Label - Only / No - Alignment training condition ( though each reliably outperformed the No Training control , as noted above ) . To further illuminate the pattern of sorting , we display a scatterplot for each condition , representing all subjects by their proportions of causal and domain sorts along the Y and X axes , respectively ( Fig . 5 ) . These scatter plots display the obvious point that causal and domain sorting are negatively correlated . More importantly , they show to what degree subjects sorted by domain , by causal system , or by a mixed approach . They also reveal the degree to which a subject conformed to neither strategy ( due to error sorts – that is , miss - sorts and ‘‘other’’ column sorts ) . The proportion of error sorts for a given point is 1 minus the sum of its X and Y values ; thus , the closer a point is to the graphs’ origin , the greater the number of errors in that subject’s sorts . Fig . 5 reveals there were very few hybrid strategies : out of 97 subjects , only 3 sorted over 30 % by causal system and 30 % by domain . That is , subjects tended to have either a causal or domain focus , and to differ in how successfully they implemented this focus ( as shown by their points’ dis - tance from the origin ) . For example , comparing Explana - tion / Align with the other conditions in Experiment 1a , we see more points clustered near the causal axis , suggest - ing few domain sorters ; and those points are higher on the causal axis , suggesting fewer errors .

B . Goldwater , D . Gentner / Cognition 137 ( 2015 ) 137 – 153 We next compared the ﬁrst sorting to the second sort - ing . The second sorting was included to allow subjects to demonstrate causal sensitivity even if their ﬁrst sorting had been by content domain . However , causal sorting was reliably less frequent in the second sort ( M = . 14 ) than in the ﬁrst ( M = . 36 ) , t ( 96 ) = 4 . 92 , p < . 001 , d = . 50 , and domain sorting was correspondingly more frequent ( 2nd M = . 61 ; 1st M = . 38 ) , t ( 96 ) = 3 . 89 , p < . 001 , d = . 39 ( see Fig . 6 ) . This pattern held for all training conditions ; in the No Training condition , the rates of causal sorting did not differ between ﬁrst ( M = . 14 ) and second ( M = . 15 ) sort , t ( 19 ) = 0 . 18 ) . It appears that subjects who perceived the causal matches generally used them in the ﬁrst sort ; and these subjects were typically capable of using a domain strategy on the second sort . In contrast , those who used domain sorting on their ﬁrst sort were unlikely to adopt causal sorting on the second sort . Assessing the accuracy of causal representations . To test the hypothesis that causal explication would improve the representation of individual training examples , we assessed the accuracy of the subjects’ diagrams . The dia - grams were scored as correct or incorrect , according to whether they represented all and only the causal relations in the phenomenon description ( see Fig . 7 for examples ) . All diagrams were scored by a research assistant . As a reli - ability check , the ﬁrst author scored the diagrams from 25 of the 75 subjects ( 200 of the 600 diagrams ) . ( Both raters Table 3 Examples of two seed cards . Below each seed are shown one domain match and one causal system match . Seed Card : ( Environmental Science , Positive Feedback ) In the process of global warming , as the temperature of the earth rises , polar ice begins to melt . Water absorbs more heat from sunlight than ice . Consequently , as ice is turned into water , the temperature of the earth begins to rise even faster which in turn leads to increased ice - melt Same - Domain Match : ( Environmental Sci . , Common Effect ) Same Causal System Match : ( Mechanical Engineering , Feedback ) Many processes are responsible for the level of CO 2 in the atmosphere such as fossil fuel burning , plant photosynthesis , and CO 2 absorption in oceans . When making public policy decisions about environmental issues , we must keep in mind the many complex factors that inﬂuence the level of CO 2 in the atmosphere . = In a nuclear reactor , water is used to keep the reaction under control . In the Three Mile Island incident , the water level was accidentally reduced while the nuclear reaction was already in progress . This allowed the reaction to increase and evaporate more water than normal . As the water level decreased at a faster and faster rate , the reaction increased causing a partial meltdown Seed Card : ( Economics , Common Cause ) The unemployment rate has many implications for society .

Gentner / Cognition 137 ( 2015 ) 137 – 153 143 were blind to condition . ) There was disagreement on only 8 of these 200 diagrams ; these disagreements were resolved by discussion . Just over half of the subjects ( 41 out of 75 ) drew all eight diagrams correctly . As expected , explication improved subjects’ accuracy : subjects in the Explication condition ( M = 7 . 37 out of 8 ) drew more accurate diagrams than those in the Label - Only condition ( M = 6 . 54 ) , t ( 73 ) = 2 . 23 , p < . 05 , d = . 55 . Because the means were close to ceiling we supplemented this analysis by using non - parametric bootstrapping to estimate their 95 % conﬁdence intervals ( free from assumptions of normality ) . That is , we simulated sampling distributions by sampling with replacement 1000 times from each condition ( creating dis - tributions of 1000 means ) . From these simulated sampling distributions the 95 % CI of the Explication condition was 6 . 79 – 7 . 79 ( above the mean of 6 . 54 for the Label condition ) , while the 95 % CI of the Label condition was 6 . 0 – 7 . 05 ( below the mean of 7 . 37 for the Explication condition ) . We next asked whether we could use the results of the causal - diagram task to clarify the effects of alignment . The idea is that if ( as claimed ) one effect of structural align - ment is to create more abstract relational structures , then it should be most efﬁcacious when subjects have accurate representations of both analogs . To test this , we asked whether structural alignment led to greater causal sorting for subjects who produced entirely accurate diagrams of the training cases than for those with some incorrect dia - grams . A 2 ( All - Correct Diagrams vs . Some Incorrect Dia - grams ) (cid:2) 2 ( Alignment vs . No - Alignment ) independent samples ANOVA revealed main effects of Diagram Accu - racy f ( 1 , 71 ) = 12 . 63 , p < . 05 , g 2 p = . 151 , and Alignment f ( 1 , 71 ) = 4 . 32 , p < . 05 , g 2 p = . 057 but no interaction , f ( 1 , 71 ) = 1 . 04 , p > . 30 , g 2 p = . 014 ( see Fig . 8 ) . Planned com - parison t - tests showed that for subjects with 100 % diagram accuracy , Alignment ( M = . 65 causal sorts ) led to signiﬁ - cantly more causal sorting than No - Alignment ( M = . 43 ) , t ( 39 ) = 2 . 19 , p < . 05 , d = . 70 – evidence for ‘added value’ of the alignment process even for those with perfectly correct understanding of the training examples . This effect did not hold for those with one or more incorrect diagrams ( Align - ment M = . 32 ; No - Alignment M = . 24 ) , t ( 32 ) = 0 . 78 , p > . 40 , d = . 27 . To further clarify the effects of explication and align - ment , we conducted a linear regression analysis with three categorical predictor variables : All Correct Diagrams vs . Some Incorrect , 8 Explication vs . Label - Only , and Alignment vs . No - Alignment to examine two critical hypotheses ( 1 ) The effect of explication was chieﬂy to improve the accuracy of the causal models for individual examples ; and ( 2 ) Even when subjects were 100 % accurate , alignment still improved performance . Diagram Accuracy ( Beta = . 334 , t = 2 . 91 , p < . 01 ) and Alignment ( Beta = . 225 , t = 2 . 12 , p < . 05 ) were shown to be reliable predictors of causal sorting , while Explication was not ( Beta = . 122 , t = 1 . 06 , p > . 25 ) . This anal - ysis demonstrates that once perfect diagram accuracy is accounted for , there is no signiﬁcant effect of explication on causal sorting ; but alignment still adds value . This pat - tern suggests that the effect of explication occurs through promoting accurate understanding of the causal structure of the training examples . Consistent with this idea , the Sobel Test of mediation conﬁrms that perfect diagram accuracy signiﬁcantly mediates the effect of explication on causal sorting , Sobel statistic = 2 . 50 , p < . 05 . Thus , the effect of Explication is mediated by increased accuracy of representa - tion ( as assessed by diagram accuracy ) . Overall , the results provide support for our three main claims . First , explication of the causal schema improves people’s representation of the training examples . Second , structural alignment of the training examples fosters abstraction of their common causal schema . Third , because which abstractions are produced by structural alignment depends on the subject’s representations of the examples , the combination of explication and alignment leads to the greatest gain in causal insight . However , despite these encouraging results , there are some issues that need to be considered before embracing the conclusions . First , in the analyses so far , we have treated the causal diagram task simply as a measure of the subjects’ knowledge . However , the diagramming task could have contributed to learning the causal structures , by inducing subjects to explicitly represent them . To examine this possibility , and to replicate the central ﬁnd - ing that combining Explication with Alignment leads to high rates of causal transfer , we re - ran that condition with - out causal diagramming . 2 . Experiment 1b 2 . 1 . Methods 2 . 1 . 1 . Subjects Twenty Northwestern University undergraduates par - ticipated for course credit . 2 . 1 . 2 . Materials & procedure The materials and procedure were identical to those of the Explication & Alignment condition of Experiment 1a , except that subjects did not draw causal diagrams and only sorted once . 2 . 2 . Results The results bear out the prior ﬁndings . In the Explica - tion / Alignment condition , even without diagramming , subjects produced . 58 causal sorts and . 2 domain sorts – comparable to the . 62 causal sorts and . 17 domain sorts elicited by the same condition with diagramming from Experiment 1a : Comparing causal sorts , t ( 38 ) = . 41 , p > . 65 , d = . 13 . Fig . 9 shows the scatterplot of these results . Thus , there is no evidence that causal diagramming was crucial to improving the rate of causal sorting . 3 . Experiment 2 The results so far bear out our hypothesis that structural alignment reveals common abstract relational 8 We assessed accuracy as a binary variable ( rather than a continuous variable ) in order to address the question raised earlier , of whether alignment acts to abstract an already accurate relational representation . 144 M . B . Goldwater , D . Gentner / Cognition 137 ( 2015 ) 137 – 153 patterns such as positive feedback and common - cause . This is consistent with our claim that structural alignment renders the shared causal structures more salient and promotes forming more abstract causal structures . However , we must consider another possibility . It could be that the effect of alignment is simply to alert subjects to the relevance of causal relations in this study . That is , the alignment experience could simply serve to shift sub - jects’ attention toward causality , rather than to invite new causal insight ( see Spalding & Ross , 1994 ) . Even worse , perhaps the alignment experience just acts as a demand characteristic , implicitly telling subjects to focus on causal similarities rather than domain similarities . To clarify the nature of the alignment advantage , in Experiment 2 we elicited the strategies subjects used in the sorting task . For example , if subjects in the alignment condition are more likely to refer to causality in their jus - tiﬁcations , this will leave open the possibility that the alignment advantage in causal sorting can be explained by a strategy shift toward causal structure . Of course , it is possible that alignment will serve both to shift subjects’ attention to causality and to foster causal abstractions ( as revealed in the sorting data ) . In this case , we would see both an emphasis on causality in their verbal statements and an improvement in sorting ability , relative to other conditions . A further goal of Experiment 2 was to test another pos - sible explanation of the alignment advantage . Subjects in the Alignment condition saw each of the eight phenomena twice , whereas those in the No - Alignment condition saw them only once . Thus the Alignment effects could have stemmed from greater exposure , rather than from compar - ison processes per se . To test this possibility , in Experiment 2 , we ran another condition in which subjects also revis - ited the training examples but were simply asked to ‘‘list the important factors’’ for each example phenomenon indi - vidually , rather than to compare examples . Thus , Experi - ment 2 had three conditions : Explication / Alignment , Explication / No - Alignment , and Explication / List - Factors . The ﬁrst and second conditions were identical to the con - ditions of the same name in Experiment 1a . 3 . 1 . Methods 3 . 1 . 1 . Subjects Sixty - three Northwestern University undergraduates participated in exchange for course credit : 19 in Explica - tion / No - Alignment , 21 in Explication / Alignment , and 23 in Explication / List - Factors . 3 . 1 . 2 . Materials and procedure The materials were identical to those in Experiment 1 . All subjects ﬁrst read the eight training examples and their explications ( and diagrammed each in turn ) . For the Explication / Alignment and Explication / No - Alignment con - ditions , the remaining procedures were as in Experiment 1 , with one exception . After both the ﬁrst and the second sorting , subjects were asked to write down the strategies they had used in sorting the descriptions . The instructions read , ‘‘There are many ways to sort these descriptions . Could you please write out on this page an explanation for why you sorted them the way you did ? ’’ In the Explication / List - Factors condition , after reading and diagramming the ﬁrst four training examples ( from electrical engineering ) , subjects were instructed to write out descriptions of the examples on four additional pages . They were encouraged to look back at the descriptions if needed . To guide their description , each page read [ for example ] ‘‘Consider the description of Audio Feedback . What were two factors in that situation ? ’’ Subjects responded on the same page . They then repeated this pro - cess for the four political history examples , ﬁrst reading descriptions with explications and diagramming , and then listing factors . Then they performed the AST and reported their sorting strategies as in the two other conditions . 3 . 2 . Results As shown in Fig . 10a , Explication / Alignment ( M = . 65 ) elicited more causal sorts than either Explication / No - Alignment ( M = . 37 ) or Explication / List - Factors ( M = . 37 ) , f ( 2 , 60 ) = 4 . 44 , p < . 05 , g 2 p = . 13 ; planned comparison t - tests : Explication / Alignment vs . Explication / No - Alignment t ( 38 ) = 2 . 48 , p < . 05 , d = . 81 ; Explication / Alignment vs . Explication / List - Factors t ( 42 ) = 2 . 63 , p < . 05 , d = . 81 . Expli - cation / No - Alignment elicited the same proportion of cau - sal sorts as did Explication / List - Factors . Thus the effect of alignment cannot be reduced to simply receiving more experience with the examples . 9 These results again afﬁrm that combining explication of individual cases with align - ment across cases produces the greatest gain in causal insight . As in Experiment 1a , there were no gains in causal sorting during the second sorting attempt ( see Fig . 10b ) . Fig . 11 shows the scatterplots for the ﬁrst sort . As in prior studies , hybrid strategies were quite rare , with only a single subject sorting more than 30 % via both domain and causal system . As in Experiment 1a , the Explication / Alignment condition contrasts with the two non - align - ment conditions in showing both a greater focus on causal commonalities over domain commonalities ( as shown by more points near the causal axis ) and better causal sorting ( as shown by more points higher on the causal axis ) . In the next set of analyses , we probe further into these differ - ences by analyzing the strategies the subjects reported using . Strategies reported . Subjects were scored as having a causal strategy if they ( 1 ) used the term ‘‘cause’’ or ‘‘effect’’ ( in noun , verb , or adjective form ) or ( 2 ) used a causal sys - tem label such as ‘‘positive feedback system . ’’ Subjects were scored as having a domain strategy if they explicitly labeled the domains , either with single names such as ‘‘electricity , ’’ or ‘‘the body’’ or with a longer description , such as ‘‘all relate to processes of the human body . ’’ See Table 5 for typical examples of each kind of strategy . With this coding scheme , 58 of 63 responses were unambiguously classiﬁed . Four of the 63 responses contained both kinds of language , but were classiﬁed as 9 In an unreported experiment , we also ran a condition combining Label - Only with List - Factors .

Gentner / Cognition 137 ( 2015 ) 137 – 153 causal graphs that had been diagrammed previously : ‘‘I sorted them based on the system of graphs . . . ’’ ( see Table 5 ) . One motivation for the strategy analysis was to discover whether the Alignment advantage in the prior studies stemmed simply from increased attention to causal factors , rather than from promoting causal abstractions . If this were the case , we would expect more causal focus in the strategies reported by the Alignment group . We found that the majority of reported strategies ( 44 out of 63 ) were cau - sal , with no signiﬁcant difference across the three condi - tions : Explication / Alignment ( 17 out of 21 ) ; Explication / No - Alignment ( 14 out of 19 ) ; Explication / List - Factors ( 13 out of 23 ) . The difference between Explication / Alignment and Explication / List - Factors did not reach signiﬁcance , v 2 ( 1 ) = 3 . 02 , p = . 08 . Of course , it is possible that aligning exemplars did led to greater attention to causality , and that a larger study would show this . However , even if this turns out to be the case , the next set of analyses show that the advantage of alignment extends beyond increased attention to causal relations . We next analyzed the actual sorting patterns of the sub - jects who reported causal strategies . This showed that , despite their verbal emphasis on causality , subjects dif - fered in their rate of causal sorting ( see Fig . 12 ) . The Expli - cation / Alignment condition ( M = . 77 ) elicited more causal sorts than Explication / No - Alignment ( M = . 51 ) and Explica - tion / List - Factors ( M = . 63 ) , f ( 2 , 41 ) = 6 . 31 , p < . 01 , g 2 p = . 23 ; planned comparison t - tests : Explication / Alignment vs . Explication / No - Alignment , t ( 29 ) = 3 . 26 , p < . 01 , d = 1 . 21 ; Explication / Alignment vs . Explication / List - Factors t ( 28 ) = 2 . 13 , p < . 05 , d = . 81 . We also analyzed the kinds of non - causal responses made by subjects who reported causal strategies , including both domain - based responses and errors . 10 While the Explication / No - Alignment ( M = . 17 ) condition gave rise to more domain sorts than Explication / Alignment did ( M = . 06 ) , Explication / List - Factors did not ( M = . 08 ) , f ( 2 , 41 ) = 3 . 54 , p < . 05 , g 2 p = . 14 . However , both Explication / List - Factors ( M = . 29 ) and Explication / No - Alignment ( M = . 32 ) elicited more error sorts ( miss - sorts and ‘other’ responses ) than did Explication / Alignment ( M = . 16 ) : t ( 28 ) = 2 . 38 , p < . 05 , d = . 91 ; t ( 29 ) = 3 . 07 , p < . 01 , d = 1 . 15 ( respectively ) .

M . B . Goldwater , D . Gentner / Cognition 137 ( 2015 ) 137 – 153 147 Next , we examined the minority of subjects ( n = 19 ) who reported a domain strategy ( due to the small number per condition , and a lack of reliable differences across con - ditions , we combined these subjects across conditions ) . They mostly sorted by domain – ranging from . 50 to 1 . 00 domain sorts – with few causal sorts ( . 02 causal , . 77 domain , and . 21 errors ) . ( In contrast , only a single subject reporting a causal strategy sorted primarily by domain ( at . 58 ) . ) Interestingly , domain - strategy subjects were less accurate overall in their diagrams ( M = 6 . 68 out of 8 ) than causal - strategy subjects ( M = 7 . 63 ) , t ( 60 ) = 3 . 54 , p < . 01 , d = . 99 . We again estimated the conﬁdence intervals of each condition via non - parametric bootstrapping . The 95 % CI for the domain - strategy subjects was 6 . 0 – 7 . 26 ( below the 7 . 63 mean of the causal - strategy subjects ) , and the 95 % CI for the causal - strategy subjects was 7 . 41 – 7 . 81 ( above the 6 . 68 mean of the domain - strategy subjects ) . Next we analyzed the reported strategies for the second sorting attempt ( N = 57 ; six subjects who reported strate - gies for their ﬁrst attempt did not report their second strat - egy ) . We classiﬁed their strategies as to whether they were a modiﬁcation of their initial strategy ( causal or domain ) or a switch from one to the other . As in the prior studies , the likelihood of switching from causal to domain strategy was far greater ( 33 switched while 7 modiﬁed ) than the reverse ( 6 switched while 11 modiﬁed ) , v 2 ( 1 ) = 12 . 30 , p < . 001 . In summary , subjects mostly espoused a causal strat - egy . However , among those subjects who expressed a cau - sal strategy , subjects who aligned examples were better able to implement this strategy . Speciﬁcally , subjects in the Explanation / Alignment group produced more causal sorts and fewer error sorts than those in the other two groups – supporting the idea that aligning parallel causal phenomena led subjects to form abstract , portable causal system schemas . Additionally , analysis of the reported strategies on the second sort conﬁrms that , as in the prior studies , domain strategies are readily available to people who sort causally ; but the reverse does not hold . 4 . General discussion Expertise is often marked by an increased sensitivity to important abstract patterns in the world . Our goal here was to shed light on the kinds of learning processes that foster this generalized sensitivity . We focused on high - level causal system categories such as positive feedback and common - effect – an important set of cross - domain abstractions . Recognition of these causal systems allows people to understand and predict key phenomena in the world , from global warming to economic bubbles . We know from prior research that these categories are not sali - ent to college students without advanced training ( Rottman et al . , 2012 ) . Our interest here is in what kinds of learning experiences allow people to spontaneously rec - ognize these patterns in the world . Of course , in our laboratory situation we were not able to achieve the richness and complexity of real - world experience . To approximate this situation , we used the Ambiguous Sorting Task ( AST ) , in which subjects are free to sort as they choose , and in which a highly salient com - peting organization – that of content domain – is present . Our ﬁndings indicate that the AST technique was success - ful in providing a competing organization . In the No - Train - ing condition , as in Rottman et al . ’s study , we found very low levels of spontaneous causal sorting ; only 14 % of examples were sorted causally . Thus , the AST achieved its goal in that the high - level causal patterns did not stand out . This sets the stage for asking whether and how align - ment and schema - explication can improve causal insight . There are three main ﬁndings . First , as predicted , receiving explications of how the training examples ﬁt the causal schemas improved subjects’ causal representa - tions of the examples . This was evidenced by ( 1 ) analysis of subjects’ causal diagrams , which showed that explica - tion led to more accurate representations of the training examples ; and ( 2 ) regression and mediation analyses indi - cating that the positive effects of causal explication on transfer stemmed from its having increased the accuracy of subjects’ representations of the training examples ( Experiment 1a ) . Second , structural alignment increased causal sorting , even for those who drew accurate diagrams for every training example – evidence of its value in pro - moting abstractions that go beyond the examples given . Third , combining causal explication with analogical abstraction led to the greatest degree of causal insight , as assessed by greater causal sorting in the AST . Further stud - ies showed that the results cannot be attributed to the dia - gram task per se ( Experiment 1b ) nor to additional exposure to the pairs of examples ( Experiment 2 ) , nor sim - ply to a general attentional shift toward causality among alignment subjects ( Experiment 2 ) . 4 . 1 . Analogical processing in learning and transfer The consistent pattern across the set of experiments adds to research showing that analogical comparison can lead to relational insight and thereby facilitate transfer to new situations . Further , our ﬁndings join other recent work in arguing for an expanded role for analogical processing in 0 . 0 0 . 1 0 . 2 0 . 3 0 . 4 0 . 5 0 . 6 0 . 7 0 . 8 0 . 9 1 . 0 Expl / No - Align Expl / List Expl / Align P r o p . o f S o r t s Causal System Domain a Fig . 10a .

Gentner / Cognition 137 ( 2015 ) 137 – 153 learning and transfer ( Day & Goldstone , 2012 ; Doumas & Hummel , 2013 ; Gentner , 2003 ; Gentner , 2010 ) . In much of the initial work on analogical transfer , the focus was on direct mapping and inference projection from one example to another ( e . g . Gick & Holyoak , 1980 ; Reed , 1987 ; Reeves & Weisberg , 1994 ; Ross , 1984 ) . But as Day and Goldstone ( 2012 ) and Lave ( 1988 ) note , this ‘‘two - problem’’ experimental design , wherein transfer is assessed by determining whether a given example inﬂu - ences a single subsequent ( analogical ) case , greatly restricts the scope of what prior knowledge a participant can bring to bear on a new situation . Our goal in developing the AST is to go beyond this method – to study the more generalized ability to sponta - neously notice important patterns . Our ﬁndings add to evi - dence that the effects of analogical processing go well beyond inference projection ( Gentner , 2010 ; Kurtz et al . , 2001 ) . In our studies , people who received a combination of explication and alignment showed a generalized sensi - tivity to the key causal patterns that emerged from their training . This kind of learning serves as a source of insight that can inﬂuence the way we interpret further informa - tion ( e . g . , Day & Goldstone , 2012 ; Doumas & Hummel , 2013 ; Fernbach & Sloman , 2009 ; Gentner & Stevens , 1983 ; Schwartz , Sears , & Bransford , 2005 ) .

B . Goldwater , D . Gentner / Cognition 137 ( 2015 ) 137 – 153 creates a kind of internal vocabulary that allows for the recognition of abstract relational patterns in novel situations . We have provided evidence that analogical processing supports deriving causal systems abstractions that aid in transfer . We suggest that this kind of higher - order knowl - edge of causal systems can make people better able to detect such patterns in novel experiential situations . Con - sistent with the hypothesis , Fernbach and Sloman ( 2009 ) found that people improved in their ability to discover complex causal structures – speciﬁcally , causal chains – from observation when they were pretrained with sche - matic causal information . In combination with the current results , this supports the possibility that alignment - based pretraining might support later causal structure discovery . A second open question concerns the mechanism that underlies analogical abstraction . We hypothesize that alignment improved their existing structured knowledge in two ways : by dropping non - common surface features from the representations and by reﬁning the representa - tions of the relations themselves . Both the symbolic AI models built upon the Structure - Mapping Engine ( Falkenhainer et al . , 1989 ; Kuehne , Forbus , Gentner , & Quinn , 2000 ; Lovett , Tomai , Forbus , & Usher , 2009 ) and the symbolic - connectionist architectures of LISA ( Hummel & Holyoak , 1997 ) and DORA ( Doumas , Hummel , & Sandhofer , 2008 ) offer computational descrip - tions of feature - shedding and relational re - representation ( see Gentner & Forbus , 2011 for a recent review ) . However , it remains an open question as to how to distinguish the two processes in behavior , as each would lead to improve - ments in transfer . 4 . 2 . Category learning and representation The current studies add to the growing literature on relational categories . These are categories whose member - ship is determined not by common intrinsic properties of the members , but by common relational structure ( Corral & Jones , 2014 ; Gentner , 2005 ; Gentner & Kurtz , 2005 ; Gentner et al . , 2011 ; Goldwater , Markman , & Stilwell , 2011 ; Jung & Hummel , 2011 ; Markman & Stilwell , 2001 ; Rehder & Ross , 2001 ; Tomlinson & Love , 2010 ) . We view the causal system categories studied here as examples of relational categories . This is consistent with research showing the connection between causal reasoning and cat - egory representation , which ﬁnds that the causal relational structures binding features of category exemplars are crit - ical for determining category membership and category - based induction ( e . g . , Ahn et al . , 2000 ; Forbus , 1984 ; Rehder , 2003 ; Rehder & Burnett , 2005 ; Sloman et al . , 1998 ) . Our ﬁnding that analogical comparison can support the abstraction of such causal structures is consistent with past work showing that comparing examples supports forming relational categories ( Christie & Gentner , 2010 ; Gentner et al . , 2011 ; Goldwater & Markman , 2011 ; Jung & Hummel , 2011 ; Kotovsky & Gentner , 1996 ; Kurtz et al . , 2013 ; Tomlinson & Love , 2010 ) . Further , our ﬁnding that alignment was most beneﬁcial when exemplar relational representations were accurately represented accords with those of Doumas and Hummel ( 2013 ) who found that alignment aids learning category - deﬁning higher - order relations ( i . e . , relations among relations ) only when the lower - order relations are properly represented . Another link between our ﬁndings and the relational category literature is that we found a shift from focusing on relatively concrete domain - level commonalities in the No - training condition to noticing common causal patterns among the subjects after full training . This kind of ‘‘rela - tional shift’’ in category understanding – from an early focus on concrete features to a later focus on relational structure – is well - attested in cognitive development ( Gentner & Rattermann , 1991 ; Imai , Gentner , & Uchida , 1994 ; Richland , Morrison , & Holyoak , 2006 ) , as well as in novice - expert studies of adults ( Chi et al . 1981 ; Jee et al . , 2014 ; Profﬁtt , Coley , & Medin , 2000 ; Shafto & Coley , 2003 ; Stains & Talanquer , 2008 ) . Further , there is evidence that analogical comparison can promote this shift from object focus to relational focus ( Christie & Gentner , 2010 ; Gentner et al . , 2011 ; Kotovsky & Gentner , 1996 ; Namy & Gentner , 2002 ) . 4 . 3 . Analogical learning in education These ﬁndings have implications for educational prac - tice . It appears that a combination of explication plus structural alignment can lead to greater attention to and ability to recognize causal patterns , mirroring the pattern found in development of expertise . Indeed , the contrast between the No Training group ( 14 % causal sorting ) and the maximal - training group ( Explication / Alignment , 62 % causal sorting ) parallels the contrast found by Rottman et al . ( 2012 ) between science novices ( 23 % causal sorting ) and physical science majors ( 44 % causal sorting ) . Of course , we would not claim that a brief training session can substi - tute for systematic study and experience . Nevertheless , these results join with current research in suggesting that providing more support for analogical comparison 0 . 00 0 . 10 0 . 20 0 . 30 0 . 40 0 . 50 0 . 60 0 . 70 0 . 80 0 . 90 1 . 00 Causal System Domain Error P r o p . o f S o r t s Expl / No - Align Expl / List Expl / Align Fig . 12 .

Conclusion This research shows that explicating and aligning causal phenomena fosters abstraction of the causal structure and increased sensitivity to causal systems in novel phenom - ena . These results add to the literature on causal reasoning by focusing on the recognition of common causal structure across disparate phenomena . More generally , these results add to our understanding how abstract knowledge is acquired over experience .
