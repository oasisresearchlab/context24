Protein – protein unbinding induced by force : single - molecule studies John W Weisel (cid:1)y , Henry Shuman z and Rustem I Litvinov (cid:1) Experiments in which two speciﬁcally interacting protein molecules are dissociated by external force have yielded new insights into mechanisms involved in cell adhesion , leukocyte rolling , regulation of integrin activity , antigen – antibody interactions and other protein - mediated reactions contingent upon molecular recognition . Another important aspect of force - induced protein – protein unbinding studies is the new information being gleaned about the thermodynamics and kinetics of bond rupture .

During the past decade , impor - tant new information about receptor – ligand interactions at the single - molecule level has complemented con - clusions based on conventional methods , which measure the properties of large ensembles of molecules or observe the behavior of whole cells . The main advantages of studying individual receptor – ligand pairs are : minimized cooperative and / or clustering effects ; the possibility of probing conformational transitions of individual mole - cules , such as activation / inactivation ; revealing the struc - tural and functional heterogeneity of seemingly identical molecules ; knowing the number of molecules involved in reactions ; quantifying directly the magnitudes and work - ing distances of forces in ligand – receptor interactions to elucidate the relationships between molecular structure and the thermodynamics of bond dissociation . Watching individual events and distributions rather than observing average values may reveal rare but physiologically impor - tant functional ﬂuctuations [ 1 (cid:4) , 2 ] . The study of protein – protein interactions has been domi - nated by a static viewpoint , such that the emphasis is on molecules in solution under equilibrium conditions , whereas their real - life biological interactions generally occur on surfaces under nonequilibrium conditions ; the latter is the focus of the papers summarized in this review . The study of the mechanics of protein interactions is necessary to understand the many cellular functions and properties , such as rolling , motility , adhesion , deform - ability and so on , that are mediated by speciﬁc receptor and ligand molecules , and controlled by mechanical forces produced by either external ( shear ﬂow ) or internal ( cytoskeletal rearrangement , motor proteins ) sources . In addition , the study of protein – protein unbinding by an applied force has turned out to be a precise and unique tool for analyzing protein structure and function , as well as mechanisms of their regulatory changes [ 3 ] . Theory The results of mechanical rupture ( pulling ) experiments have been analyzed using two distinct theoretical meth - ods [ 4 ] . The ﬁrst , called the energy landscape model , is based on Kramers’ rate theory and leads to general pre - dictions about the distribution of rupture forces [ 5 (cid:4) ] . In this model , it is assumed that an applied load changes the energy of the transition state as well as the equilibrium of the bound and unbound states , thereby altering the kinetics of association and dissociation [ 6 ] . An important conclusion from the model is that the distribution of rupture forces depends on the loading rate ( i . e . the rate that the applied force is increased ) and that this depen - dence provides information not obtained from equili - brium experiments [ 7 (cid:4) ] . Pulling experiments in which the loading rate is changed over many orders of magni - tude are called dynamic force spectroscopy . One impor - tant open question is whether these force spectra can be used to uniquely identify the dissociation mechanism [ 8 (cid:4) ] . A recent advance in nonequilibrium thermody - namics [ 9 (cid:4) ] , based on an insight from Jarzynski [ 10 ] , further suggests that the complete free energy diagram in the direction of the applied load can be inferred by correctly averaging repeated traces of the force versus www . current - opinion . com Current Opinion in Structural Biology 2003 , 13 : 227 – 235 time ( trajectories ) acquired at constant pulling velocity . Although the method has not yet been applied to protein – protein interactions , it was veriﬁed for the mechanical unfolding of RNA [ 11 (cid:4)(cid:4) ] . The second method uses molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the disruption of speciﬁc pairs of molecules in atomic detail [ 12 ] . Ideally , this type of model provides new insights into the mechanisms of protein – ligand inter - actions [ 13 (cid:4) , 14 , 15 ] . However , meaningful simulations require complete X - ray crystal structures of the proteins and huge computational resources . Even with the most powerful current computers , the simulations only last (cid:5) 10 ns , roughly three orders of magnitude less than typical pulling experiments . One of Jarzynski’s predic - tions is that his equality holds even very far from equili - brium or at very high loading rates . Recent computational and theoretical advances allow us to be more conﬁdent that dynamic force spectroscopy may provide important information on how proteins bind and unbind . Principles and methodology Force - induced receptor – ligand unbinding studies are always performed at an interface . Molecular binding and rupture result from controlled touching and separa - tion of two surfaces , one bearing receptors and another coated with ligand . The different techniques used to perform these kinds of experiments differ from each other mainly by the surfaces to which the proteins are bound , as well as by the methods of generating , sensing and measuring mechanical forces . The techniques used during the past several years for studies of single - protein molecular mechanics are : atomic force microscopy ( AFM ) , also termed scanning force microscopy ( SFM ) [ 16 ] ; laser tweezers ( LT ) [ 17 ] ; biomembrane force probe ( BFP ) with pipette suction [ 18 ] ; and hydrodynamic meth - ods [ 19 (cid:4) ] . The forces generated and sensed during single - molecule experiments are in the range of several pico - newtons ( 1 pN ¼ 10 (cid:7) 12 N ) to about one nanonewton ( 1 nN ¼ 10 (cid:7) 9 N ) , although no single instrument can ade - quately cover the entire range of forces . The magnitudes of these forces correspond to the range of noncovalent interactions , but they are insufﬁcient to break a covalent bond [ 20 ] . The interacting receptor and ligand molecules both have to be ﬁrmly bound to their underlying surfaces to ensure that the measured forces reﬂect protein – protein unbind - ing rather than the detachment of molecules from the surface [ 21 ] . When experiments are performed with pur - iﬁed proteins , they should be coupled to surfaces either covalently or at least via biotin – ( strept ) avidin interac - tions , which are stronger than any known noncovalent protein – protein adhesion . Covalent linkages are made either directly using bifunctional reagents [ 22 (cid:4)(cid:4) , 23 ] or via spacer molecules [ 24 (cid:4) , 25 ] , which is seemingly prefer - able because of the higher ﬂexibility and better spatial orientation of surface - bound proteins . However , stretch - ing of polymeric linkers changes the unbinding proﬁle by giving rise to delayed nonlinear receptor – ligand rupture force signals [ 24 (cid:4) ] . As in ensemble experiments , discrimination between speciﬁc and nonspeciﬁc interactions is a major concern , requiring carefully chosen control experiments . Two important control experiments are replacing one of the reacting partners with an inert protein ( e . g . albumin ) or applying speciﬁc inhibitors that abolish the interaction in a dose - dependent manner . Irrespective of the origin of nonspeciﬁc surface - to - surface attraction , several studies have shown that nonspeciﬁc protein – protein adhesion strength may reach the value of several tens of piconew - tons , partly overlapping the forces produced by speciﬁc receptor – ligand interactions ( Figure 1 ) [ 26 , 27 ] . These weaker nonspeciﬁc protein – protein interactions may have physiological signiﬁcance in cell adhesion in coop - eration with the speciﬁc interactions [ 22 (cid:4)(cid:4) ] . An important question that is difﬁcult to answer unequi - vocally is whether one or multiple pairs of molecules interact during pulling experiments . Two pieces of evi - dence , both based on statistics , are commonly used to determine whether single - molecule interactions are detected . The ﬁrst requires that only a limited fraction of touching cycles between the surfaces result in binding [ 19 (cid:4) , 27 ] . For example , when only ten IgG molecules were bound per bead and the protein A surface density was also very low , the probability of formation of more than one IgG – protein A pair at a particular scanning velocity was calculated to be at most 9 % [ 27 ] . Secondly , histograms of the distribution of rupture forces can show a series of quantized peaks that are multiples of a single value [ 23 , 28 ] . Although there are other important indirect cri - teria supporting individual molecule interactions [ 29 (cid:4) ] , reasonable conclusions must be substantiated by combi - nations of data obtained independently . Protein – protein unbinding studies performed on live cells with exposed receptor molecules have several limitations and uncertainties . One of them is the chance of uprooting receptor molecules from the membrane , which depends on pulling time and force as well as on membrane tension [ 30 , 31 ] . A related problem is mechanical compliance and membrane tethering , combined with interactions of recep - tors with the cytoskeleton [ 30 , 32 ] . Receptor clustering also can potentially affect quantiﬁcation of single - molecule receptor – ligand interactions , because it was shown that chemical cross - linking of receptors led to increased ligand binding strength as a result of receptor cooperativity [ 33 , 34 (cid:4) ] . Similarly , self - association of selectins led to shear resistance and changed unbinding parameters for P - selectin and its ligand , P - selectin glycoprotein ligand - 1 ( PSGL - 1 ) [ 35 ] . Nevertheless , properly performed recep - tor – ligand binding studies with proteins naturally residing 228 Macromolecular assemblages Current Opinion in Structural Biology 2003 , 13 : 227 – 235 www . current - opinion . com on metabolically active cells are physiologically more rele - vant and most promising . Some recent results of enforced single - molecule protein – protein unbinding , along with a partial description of the experimental conditions , are summarized in Table 1 . It can be seen that the majority of peak rupture forces measured over a wide range of loading rates are in the interval from several tens up to (cid:5) 150 pN . The forces measured at similar loading rates appear to be indepen - dent of underlying surfaces , coating chemistry and mea - suring techniques . However , there is an obvious difference in the rupture forces for different protein – protein pairs . These results imply that the different rupture forces reﬂect multiple mechanisms of recep - tor – ligand dissociation , rather than diversity of experi - mental conditions . Applications The strength of cell attachment to substrata and / or to another cell is a good example of how the mechanical characteristics of single molecules determine cell func - tion . That is why integrins , selectins and cadherins , which mediate cellular interactions , were among the ﬁrst pro - teins studied at the single - molecule level using force - induced unbinding methodology . Cell adhesion and aggregation are strongly inﬂuenced by the mechanical plasticity of cells , by the direction and rate of applied external forces , and by the mutual accessibility of the receptor and ligand molecules [ 4 , 36 , 37 ] . The regulation of binding - site exposure was directly demonstrated in a study in which the interactions of ﬁbrinogen with the integrin a IIb b 3 were studied on live platelets with different degrees of activation [ 22 (cid:4)(cid:4) ] .

In each touching / separation cycle , the forces are displayed as two peaks : a negative , compressive force between a receptor - coated surface and a ligand - coupled latex bead , and a positive , unbinding force that increases linearly with time until the receptor – ligand bond is ruptured , after which the force rapidly returns to zero . If attachment does not occur , the positive rupture force is absent . ( b ) Rupture forces following detachment of surfaces are collected and displayed as normalized force distribution histograms .

or - none phenomenon , that is , each integrin molecule resides on the platelet in an either completely on or off conformation [ 22 (cid:4)(cid:4) ] . The strength of ﬁbrino - gen – a IIb b 3 binding was shown to be dependent on the ‘age’ of bonds ; ‘young’ complexes formed within min - utes were capable of dissociation under hydrodynamic force , whereas ‘older’ complexes could not be ruptured [ 19 (cid:4) ] . Probing interactions of individual integrins on the surface of live cells with ligands containing the RGD ( Arg - Gly - Asp ) binding motif revealed a considerable extension of the ﬂexible membrane surface under load [ 28 ] , as well as a paradoxical increase in the number of cells that remain adherent when larger pulling forces were applied [ 34 (cid:4) ] . The interaction of the platelet integrin GPIb a with von Willebrand factor ( vWF ) was shown to have kinetic characteristics similar to those of binding reactions of selectins [ 38 (cid:4) ] . Dynamic force spectroscopy studies revealed that the rupture forces of both integrins and selectins with their protein ligands depend on applied force loading rates . When the range of applied force loading rates was wide enough and reached 10 4 pN / s or more , two regimes were observed as different slopes in the peak force versus logarithm of loading rate curves . They were interpreted as reﬂecting two sequential energy barriers along the unbinding pathway . Changing experimental conditions revealed that these barriers had different susceptibility to divalent cations [ 39 (cid:4)(cid:4) ] and may have different physiological signiﬁcance [ 40 (cid:4)(cid:4) , 41 (cid:4)(cid:4) ] . The ﬁrst , inner barrier for the a 5 b 1 – ﬁbronectin pair , observed at high forces , was sensitive to RGD deletion , but not to deletion in the synergy site of ﬁbronectin . The second , outer barrier , operating at lower , physiologically relevant forces , was affected by both RGD and synergy binding regions , and was characteristic of the site of integrin activation [ 41 (cid:4)(cid:4) ] . In a study of leukocyte function - asso - ciated antigen - 1 ( LFA - 1 ) and intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 ( ICAM - 1 ) , it was shown that , in the slow loading regime , Mg 2 þ , known to stabilize the LFA - 1 – ICAM - 1 interaction , increased the unbinding forces , whereas the fast loading regime was susceptible to an inhibitory effect of EDTA . Hence , the outer activation barrier was attributed to an equilibrium dissociation con - stant , whereas the inner barrier was thought to determine resistance to pulling forces [ 40 (cid:4)(cid:4) ] . These thermodynamic characteristics , along with kinetic parameters and bond elasticity , fully control the dynamic process of cell adhe - sion and leukocyte rolling [ 13 (cid:4) , 42 , 43 (cid:4) ] , and may account for their impairment in pathologically altered cells [ 44 (cid:4) ] . The binding strength between antigen and antibody has been used as a tool to probe conformational states of a single protein molecule in several studies . AFM tips functionalized with antibodies were used to produce two images , the ﬁrst , an adhesion image of individual ICAM - 1 molecules , compared to the second , topographi - cal one [ 26 ] . In another AFM study , antibodies were used to conﬁrm proper membrane orientation in cell - derived vesicles and to probe the conformational changes of an Table 1 Continued Receptor (cid:1) and receptor - bearing surface Ligand (cid:1) and ligand - bearing surface Measuringtechnique Reported loading or shear rate / stress Ruptureforces ( pN ) References Microtubules Two - or one - headed kinesin LT 5 . 0 (cid:8) 1 . 68 pN / s 3 . 3 – 10 [ 49 (cid:4)(cid:4) ] Adsorbed to glass Covalently linked to latex beads Actin from rabbit muscle Bovine Arp2 / 3 complex with VCA LT 50 . 5 (cid:8) 17 . 3 pN / s 6 – 7 [ 48 (cid:4) ] Attached to gelsolin - coated latex beads Arp2 / 3 adsorbed on a VCA - coated surface Various proteins Bovine insulin Bovine insulin AFM 7 . 4 nN / s y 1340 – 1350 [ 61 ] Covalently linked to aminosilanized mica using photoreactive azido groups Covalently linked to aminosilanized tips using photoreactive azido groups Chaperonin GroEL from E . coli Mutated ( Gly !

Conclusions and perspectives Most of the results of those experiments listed in Table 1 that were carefully designed and executed show that rupture forces for adhesion proteins are characteristic of each ligand – receptor pair . The usual range for typical proteins appears to be (cid:5) 100 pN þ / (cid:7) 50 pN , but there may be exceptions . Although loading rates under most physiological conditions have not been determined , it is likely that these forces were measured with loading rates that cells might really experience , for example in ﬂowing blood . It should be noted that the experiments described in some papers listed here are incomplete , lacking impor - tant controls or have problems with methodology or interpretation , reﬂecting the difﬁculty of these studies . The results of all single - molecule protein – protein unbinding induced by force experiments still need to be interpreted with caution . Future research in this ﬁeld should take into account the cautions presented in this review . Although studies of protein – protein unbinding induced by force are still in their infancy , there have been impor - tant theoretical and experimental breakthroughs , but much remains unknown . The theory behind nonequili - brium events needs to be further tested and related to equilibrium processes . More studies will explore the detailed events during unbinding and binding via simula - tion of experimental data by molecular dynamics calcula - tions , which need to be extended in time . The current literature on prototypical puriﬁed protein – protein systems will be expanded to include many other biologically important molecules , especially adhesive proteins , but much of the excitement in this ﬁeld is likely to lie with studies involving live cells . Speciﬁc mutations in func - tionally important sites can be designed to elucidate molecular mechanisms of ligand – receptor interactions . More complex systems should be investigated , including clustering of receptors in the membrane , interactions between two different receptors and cytoskeletal interac - tions . Studies in the future may involve the simultaneous measurement of forces and other functional parameters , such as phosphorylation or other biochemical activity , distribution of GFP - labeled proteins , channel movement or the behavior of other stress sensors . Single - molecule studies of protein – protein unbinding address fundamental questions on the origins of the speciﬁcity and dynamics of cellular interactions . In the future , it may be possible to relate single - molecule studies to whole cell interactions and the changing protein – protein interactions that occur during the development of the organism , and during cellular physiological and pathological processes .

Different adhesion behaviors of leukocytes were modeled as a function of the most important molecular properties of individual receptor – ligand pairs . It was shown that the unstressed dissociation rate and the bond interaction length are most important for control of the dynamics of cell adhesion . The simulation model described provides the means to eluci - date how the structures of receptor and ligand molecules correlate with their dynamic properties and receptor - mediated cell adhesion . 14 .

Optically trapped ﬁbrinogen - coupled latex beads were repeatedly reacted with either puriﬁed surface - bound a IIb b 3 or a IIb b 3 on live platelets . The probability of effective binding events was directly proportional to the degree of cell stimulation but the adhesion strength was not changed , indicating that platelets regulate the number of accessible binding sites , not the afﬁnity of ligand binding . 23 .

Fibroblasts expressing a V b 3 and a 5 b 1 were allowed to bind and then detach from surfaces coated with clustered RGD peptide . Instead of the expected decrease in the number of cells with increasing force , the fraction of cells remaining attached increased as the pulling force was increased to between 70 and 150 pN . This adhesion reinforcement directly correlated with the cluster size and was not observed on ﬁbro - nectin - coated surfaces . 35 .

The authors measured the strength of single L - selectin bonds to PSGL - 1 or to PSGL - 1 fragments known to be involved in this binding event , namely the tetrasaccharide sialyl Lewis X ( sLe x ) and the outer 19 amino acid segment ( 19FT ) with sulfated tyrosine residues . Force spectra for the attachment of all three ligands to L - selectin were coincident , which indicates that bond strengths were dominated by a link between sLe x and the lectin . 40 .

Cells expressing a 5 b 1 were attached to ConA - coated AFM tips and touched repeatedly to a surface bearing a fragment derived from the cell - binding ﬁbronectin domain . Two force loading regimes , slow and fast , obtained with a loading rate range of three orders of magnitude , had different susceptibility to deletions in ﬁbronectin . 42 .

(cid:4) Chen S , Springer TA : Selectin receptor - ligand bonds : formation limited by shear rate and dissociation governed by the Bell model . Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2001 , 98 : 950 - 955 . Neutrophils were rolled over a P - selectin - coated surface at different shear rates and shear stresses ( regulated by viscosity at the same shear rate ) . Bond formation between neutrophils and the surface was a function of shear rate , whereas bond dissociation was a function of shear stress and hence the force on the bond . The Bell model was shown to ﬁt well the experimental parameters of unbinding . 44 . (cid:4) Hanley W , McCarty O , Jadhav S , Tseng Y , Wirtz D , Konstantopoulos K : Single - molecule characterization of P - selectin / ligand binding . J Biol Chem 2003 , in press . The forces and unstressed off - rates ofP - selectin – PSGL - 1 interactions on neutrophils differed from those of P - selectin binding to a novel ligand on colon carcinomas . This provides a mechanistic basis for the differential abilities of neutrophils and carcinomas to tether and roll on P - selectin substrates under blood ﬂow conditions . 45 .

The observed speciﬁc recognition signals with anti - g - glutamyl - transpep - tidase ( g - GT ) antibody proved the accessibility of g - GT and were indi - cative of proper membrane orientation in the vesicles . Then , the normal unbinding force proﬁle for SGCT and its antibody was determined ; it changed in the presence of either D - glucose or phlorizine , a speciﬁc inhibitor of SGCT . The data demonstrate that the speciﬁc antibody - binding epitope of the SGCT , located in the segment comprising amino acids 606 – 630 , undergoes conformational changes during D - glucose transport . 46 .

Biophys J 2000 , 79 : 962 - 974 . Bead - coupled actin ﬁlaments were attached at two or more points to a surface coated with heavy meromyosin ( HMM ) and then pulled via the optically trapped latex bead to disrupt the bond that was the closest to the bead . The measured average unbinding force of the actin – HMM rigor bond in the absence of ATP was a few times larger than the known sliding force . 47 .

Biochem Biophys Res Commun 2002 , 293 : 1550 - 1555 . The Arp2 / 3 protein complex and WASP family proteins containing the active VCA domain are involved in regulation of actin polymerization . Bead - attached actin ﬁlaments and free Arp2 / 3 were allowed to reach the VCA - coated surface , with subsequent unbinding induced by pulling the optically trapped bead and controlling its displacement . It was suggested that the measured unbinding force reﬂected the detachment of the actin – Arp2 / 3 complex from the VCA - coated surface , rather than the rupture of actin – Arp2 / 3 bonds . 49 .
