We used a rapid 33 immunologic assay ( BIOSYNEX® COVID - 19 BSS [ IgG / IgM ] ) and adjusted for test performance and 34 mismatch between the sampled population and that of the general camp population . To estimate 35 mortality , we exhaustively interviewed all households ( n = 12860 ) in the camp about deaths occurring 36 from January 2019 through March 2021 . 37 Results : 38 We included 1206 participants in the seroprevalence study . In total , 8 % ( 95 % CI : 6 . 6 % - 9 . 7 % ) had a 39 positive serologic test . After adjusting for test performance and standardizing on age , we estimated 40 a seroprevalence of 5 . 8 % ( 95 % CI : 1 . 6 % - 8 . 4 % ) . The mortality rate for 10 , 000 persons per day was 41 0 . 05 ( 95 % CI 0 . 05 - 0 . 06 ) prior to the pandemic and 0 . 07 ( 95 % CI 0 . 06 - 0 . 08 ) during the pandemic , 42 representing a significant 42 % increase ( p < 0 . 001 ) . MSF health centre consultations and hospital 43 admissions decreased by 38 % and 37 % respectively . 44 Conclusion : 45 .

Participants aged 50 years or more where among the most affected . The mortality survey 47 shows an increase in the mortality rate during the pandemic compared to before the pandemic . A 48 decline in attendance at health facilities was observed and sustained despite the easing of 49 restrictions . 50 Summary Box 51 What is already known ? 52 • At the early stage of the COVID - 19 pandemic , models predicted the risk of a large - scale 53 COVID - 19 outbreaks in camps of forcibly displaced populations that would have created 54 excess mortality caused directly by the disease and indirectly by reduced access to care 55 and / or congestion in health facilities . 56 • To date , this prediction has not materialized in most camps , the lower than expected 57 number of cases and deaths could be attributed to a population characteristics and early 58 implementation of confinement ; alternatively , it could be an underestimate caused by 59 limited screening and testing capacity and lack of morbidity and mortality surveillance . 60 • The actual impact of COVID - 19 on these populations therefore remains an open question . 61 What are the new findings ? 62 • In Dagahaley camps in Kenya , we estimated that the number of infected people was 67 63 times higher than the number of reported cases . 64 • Participants aged 50 years and over , who are most at risk of severe illness , were among the 65 most affected . 66 .

Overcrowded places such as urban slums and 84 camps of forcibly displaced populations were of particular concern . In these settings , in addition to 85 population density , higher transmissibility could occur due to larger household sizes , intense social 86 mixing between the young and elderly , inadequate water and sanitation , and specific cultural and 87 faith practices ( 2 ) . 88 .

The low numbers have been attributed to 90 limited testing capacity , differences in the population structure with a small proportion of elderly at 91 high risk of severe disease and death , a predominance of asymptomatic and pauci - symptomatic 92 infections , and early implementation of confinement ( 3 ) . However , the actual impact of COVID - 19 on 93 these populations remains an open question . 94 Accordingly , we sought to ascertain a more accurate picture of the extent of the epidemic by 95 estimating SARS - COV - 2 seroprevalence through a cross - sectional survey . In addition , through a 96 retrospective survey and programmatic data , we assessed its impact on mortality and on access to 97 healthcare before and during the COVID - 19 epidemic . The Dagahaley camp is part of the Dadaab 98 refugee complex in Kenya , where Médecins Sans Frontières ( MSF ) has been working since 2009 , was 99 a relevant location for the study . MSF provides in - patient and out - patient health services in the 100 hospital and two health centres located in the camp and works with a network of 110 community 101 health workers ( CHW ) and 45 traditional birth attendants ( TBA ) . The population of Dagahaley camp 102 was estimated at 72 , 635 inhabitants , during a survey conducted in September 2018 ( personal 103 communication Etienne Gignoux ) . 104 As of the start of the study on 3 March 2021 , 106 , 470 confirmed cases of COVID - 19 had been 105 reported in Kenya including 1 , 863 deaths ( source WHO ) . The first confirmed case of COVID - 19 in 106 Dagahaley camp was identified on 16 May 2020 . Few cases were reported in Dagahaley camp in May 107 and June 2020 ; then a first peak occurred in September and a second increase started in February 108 2021 . As of 3 March 2021 , 940 PCR tests had been performed in Dagahaley camp , confirming 47 109 positive cases , including 3 deaths . 110 Methods 111 .

To estimate seroprevalence , we 115 included two cohorts accessible to trained MSF staff : a ) All CHWs and TBAs working in Dagahaley 116 camp and their household members , as well as b ) Patients and caretakers presenting at MSF - 117 supported health centres in Dagahaley camp . 118 In order to introduce the study and seek participants , trained study staff organized a meeting with 119 all CHWs and TBAs collaborating with MSF . They highlighted the volunteer nature of participation in 120 the study . When he / she agreed , he / she informed his / her family members of the possibility to 121 participate in the study and gave them an appointment time to present to MSF health facilities . For 122 patients and caretakers , we conducted systematic time sampling of patients and caretakers 123 presenting to health centres stratified by age . 124 For practical reasons in a context where access is limited , we choose to use a rapid antibody test . 125 Antibody test haven’t shown important discordances with the ELISA , based on the correlations 126 observed in the published literature ( 3 ) . The test used in our study ( BIOSYNEX® COVID - 19 BSS 127 [ IgG / IgM ] ) offers good performance ( sensitivity : 95 . 8 % ( 95 % CI : 90 . 2−100 . 0 ) , specificity : 98 . 1 % 128 ( 95 % CI : 94 . 3 - 100 . 0 ) ) ( 4 ) and has been approved by the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Kenya 129 and the WHO . 130 131 .

CHWs were asked to visit all 132 households in the camp and to collect data on the total number of household members and every 133 death from the start of the recall period . To calculate age - specific mortality , we used the estimated 134 age distribution from a population size estimate conducted in 2018 by MSF ( supplementary 135 material ) . The recall period for the mortality survey was from 1 January 2019 until the start of the 136 study , and was divided into 2 periods : pre - pandemic ( prior to COVID - 19 detection ) from 1 January 137 2019 to 30 April 2020 ; and pandemic ( presumed active COVID - 19 transmission ) from 1 May 2020 138 until the start of the study . Data on the number of consultations , hospitalizations , and deaths at the 139 hospital were extracted from routinely collected MSF data . 140 Data analysis 141 Data analysis was conducted using R ( R Core Team , 2020 ) . All indicators ( i . e . , sex and age ) were 142 calculated as proportions with 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CI ) . Where appropriate , differences in 143 proportions were measured using Pearson χ2 tests with p - values ( p ) presented . 144 Logistic regression was performed and risk - ratios ( overall and by subpopulations ) calculated . To 145 estimate the risk associated with exposure to another infected person in the household we had to 146 determine the first infected person in the household and then identify other exposed persons . This 147 was not possible based on symptom onset , given the long recall period , and given the fact that not 148 all participants reported symptoms . Therefore , we randomly selected one of the seropositive 149 persons in the household as the first infected ; then we repeated this 1000 times to obtain the 150 relative risk , its confidence interval , and its p - value . 151 .

We estimated the proportion of 153 inhabitants for each five - year age group , then weighted the results for each individual tested with 154 the inverse of this proportion using the R Survey package ( Version 4 . 0 ) . In addition , we adjusted the 155 results taking the estimate , found in the literature , of specificity and sensitivity for identifying 156 previously infected individuals ( sensitivity : 95 . 8 % ( 95 % CI : 90 . 2−100 . 0 ) , specificity : 98 . 1 % ( 95 % CI : 157 94 . 3 - 100 . 0 ) ) ( 4 ) . We performed a Bayesian estimation of true prevalence from apparent prevalence 158 obtained from individuals tested in our sample using the R Prevalence Package ( Version 0 . 4 . 0 ) . 159 The Crude Mortality Rate ( CMR ) ( expressed as deaths / 10 , 000 people / day ) was calculated , with 95 % 160 CI provided . Mortality was calculated during two periods : 486 days pre - pandemic ( 1 January 2019 to 161 31 April 2020 ) and 326 days from the start of the pandemic ( 1 May 2020 , to 22 March 2021 , which 162 corresponds to the median date of the survey implementation ) . 163 Use of services was assessed and compared over time based on routinely collected monitoring data . 164 The number of consultations and admissions per individual per year were estimated . 165 Patient and Public Involvement 166 Although there was no specific public involvement in the development of the protocol , discussions 167 were held with Dagahaley camp community leaders and representatives about the purpose of the 168 study . The network of community health workers in the Dagahaley camp was included in the 169 research team , they were involved in adjusting the questionnaires after the pilot phase and then 170 conducted the retrospective mortality data collection . We are currently working with the local 171 health authorities on how best to communicate the study results to the community . 172 Results 173 Seroprevalence 174 .

We approached 662 patients 175 and caretakers , of whom 6 . 5 % ( 43 / 662 ) declined participation . Among the 155 TBAs and CHWs 176 recorded by MSF , 145 ( 94 % ) participated and were all included . They declared having 818 other 177 family members among whom 442 participated ( 54 % ) and were all included . Patients and caretakers 178 represented 51 % ( 619 / 1206 ) of the inclusions . The overall proportion of females was 54 % . The 179 proportion of participants under 20 years of age was 42 % ( 510 / 1206 ) , and 17 % ( 204 / 1206 ) were 50 180 years old and above . 181 The overall proportion with a positive test ( either IgG or IgM positive ) was 8 % ( 95 % CI : 6 . 6 % - 9 . 7 % ) . 182 After adjustment for test specificity and standardization of the seroprevalence results by age group 183 with the age distribution of the camp , we estimated the adjusted seroprevalence at 5 . 8 % ( 95 % CI : 184 1 . 6 % - 8 . 4 % ) . 185 The proportion of participants testing positive was lowest among those under 5 years of age and 186 highest among those aged 20 to 34 years and 50 years and above ( Table 1 ) . 187 Table 1 .

Compared to patients and caretakers , being a family member of a CHW or a TBA 193 almost doubled the risk of seropositivity , RR = 1 . 9 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 1 - 3 . 2 , p value = 0 . 015 ) , being a CHW or a 194 TBA was also associated with increased risk though this was not statistically significant , RR = 1 . 5 ( 95 % 195 CI = 0 . 9 - 2 . 6 , p value = 0 . 116 ) . 196 The recruitment of family members of CHWs and TBAs allowed an exploration of the risk associated 197 with exposure to another seropositive person in the household . Not all households were complete 198 ( 39 % ( 57 / 147 ) ) , and we included only households where at least 2 members participated in the 199 survey in our analysis . Being exposed to another seropositive person in the household was 200 significantly associated with more than two folds higher risk of seropositivity , RR = 2 . 7 ( 95 % CI = 1 . 4 - 201 5 . 2 , p value = 0 . 002 ) . In contrast , the size of the household did not seem to increase the risk , RR = 1 . 0 202 ( 95 % CI = 0 . 9 - 1 . 2 ) . 203 Seropositive participants reported at least one COVID - consistent symptom from January 2020 more 204 frequently compared to seronegative participants ( 81 % versus 45 % , p value < 0 . 001 ) ( Table 2 ) . 205 Seropositive participants with at least one COVID - consistent symptom experienced a longer duration 206 of symptoms and a median number of symptoms that was twice as high . In contrast , health seeking 207 behaviour was not statistically different based on seroprevalence status . The symptoms most 208 commonly reported by seropositive participants were cough ( 70 % ) , headache ( 64 % ) and fever ( 63 % ) . 209 210 211 .

In September 2018 , the population 218 was estimated at 72 , 635 inhabitants ; assuming linear growth , we estimated the population size mid - 219 pre - pandemic periods at 78 , 889 inhabitants and at 85 , 837 inhabitants mid - pandemic period . In 220 total , we recorded 407 deaths ( 200 pre - pandemic and 207 during the pandemic ) . 221 The CMR was low in both periods ( Table 3 ) ; however , it increased significantly by 42 % during the 222 pandemic . The highest mortality rate was among people aged 50 years and over . The mortality rate 223 increased statistically significantly among 5 - to 19 - year - olds and those 50 years and over . We 224 conducted a sensitivity analysis restricted to the same month of the year for both periods ( pre - 225 pandemic and pandemic ) and reached similar results ( see supplementary materials ) . 226 In the pre - pandemic period , 44 . 5 % ( 89 / 200 ) of the deceased were aged 50 years and over , while 227 43 . 9 % ( 91 / 207 ) were aged 50 years and over during the pandemic period .

We did not detect any significant difference by cause of 233 death during the two periods , even when stratified by aged ( < 50 vs ≥50 years ) . COVID - 19 was 234 reported as the cause of death for two cases . We did not find any significant difference between the 235 pre - pandemic and pandemic periods for any symptoms reported prior to death nor for 236 comorbidities . Most of the deceased had access to the hospital prior to death ( pre - pandemic = 74 % , 237 ( 147 / 199 ) , pandemic = 69 % ( 142 / 207 ) ) . The proportion of deaths in the hospital was similar for both 238 periods ( pre - pandemic = 42 % , n = 84 , pandemic = 36 % , n = 75 ) .

At the 246 emergency room , the decrease in consultations was much lower ( 8 % ) compared to health 247 centres ( 38 % ) , with a return to previous levels in October 2020 . Admission to the hospital showed a 248 similar decrease as consultations at health centres ( see monthly data in supplementary material ) . 249 Discussion 250 Our survey found a SARS - COV - 2 antibody seroprevalence of 5 . 8 % ( 95 % CI 1 . 5 - 8 . 5 ) in Dagahaley 251 Refugee Camp . Comparing the pre - pandemic to the pandemic periods , we observed a 42 % ( 95 % CI : 252 17 % - 72 % ) increase in the mortality rate as well as a 38 % decrease in consultations at health centres , 253 an 8 % decrease in emergency room , and a 37 % decrease in hospital admissions . 254 255 The seroprevalence found in our survey is lower than another survey conducted in Kenya in 256 November 2020 in the Nairobi population which reported a seroprevalence of 34 . 7 % ( 95 % CI 31 . 8 - 257 37 . 6 ) ( 5 ) based on ELISA , and lower that a national seroprevalence estimated from tests conducted 258 on blood donors ( 6 ) . Many factors may have contributed to the lower seroprevalence in our study : 259 first , the isolation of the Dagahaley refugee camp of over 80 , 000 people and the strict screening of 260 arrivals and visitors in the camp ; second , our survey used a rapid test that may not be as sensitive as 261 an ELISA ; third , age has been shown to be correlated with transmission ( 7 ) —the young age of 262 Dagahaley population could have play a role ; fourth , the limited number of meeting places and few 263 large enclosed spaces such as shopping centre in the camp may have limited transmission . 264 265 .

This figure is 67 times higher than the number of cases reported in the camp until the last 268 day of the survey ( 76 confirmed COVID - 19 cases up to April 26 th 2021 ) . 269 As the proportion of asymptomatic cases of COVID - 19 decreases with age ( 8 ) , it is possible that the 270 proportion of asymptomatic cases was high in Dagahaley . However , seropositive participants 271 reported having at least one symptom more frequently than seronegative participants ( 81 % versus 272 45 % ) , with a higher median number of symptoms lasting longer . These results suggest that a 273 substantial proportion of the seropositive were affected by the disease ; accordingly , the proportion 274 of asymptomatic cases cannot fully explain the difference between reported cases and estimated 275 infections . Other factors may have been involved , such as the relatively low number of tests 276 performed ( less than 1000 for over 80 , 000 people ) and the decrease in access to health care . 277 The survey showed that the risk of infection was correlated with age . People aged 20 - 35 years and 278 those aged 50 and over were the most affected in contrast to the Nairobi survey which showed a 279 slightly lower seroprevalence in this age group compared to the 20 - 50 year olds . Probably due to the 280 intense social mixing of young and old in the camp , the 50 + age group was one of the most exposed , 281 which is worrying as they are at greatest risk of mortality . The survey also shows that having an 282 infected person in the household is another factor that more than doubles the risk of infection ; 283 which is consistent with the results of other studies ( 9 ) . 284 CHWs , TBAs , and their family members had a higher seroprevalence than patients and caretakers . 285 This suggest that CHWs and TBAs are more exposed to infection , likely by occupational exposure ; by 286 extension , their household members are also more exposed due to intra - household transmission . 287 This calls for improved infection prevention and control measures for this group as well as increased 288 awareness of the importance of early detection of infection to protect the household . 289 .

These mortality rates are lower than 291 those estimated from reported mortality in Kenya ( expected CMR 0 . 16 , see supplementary 292 material ) . This may be due , among other things , to good access to basic health care in the camps . 293 The population has free access to a broad spectrum of primary and secondary care and preventive 294 activities . 295 Two deaths from COVID - 19 were reported during the survey . ( Up to the start of the survey , three 296 COVID - 19 - related deaths were officially reported ) . Analysis of the causes of death and co - 297 morbidities of the deceased showed no significant differences between the two periods and did not 298 allow the identification of deaths caused by COVID - 19 that had not been identified as such . In 299 addition , the proportion of deaths in those over 50 years of age was relatively constant ; this suggests 300 no substantial differential increase in mortality in this age group directly from COVID - 19 . 301 We estimate that eight COVID - 19 related deaths would have been expected if the age - specific 302 Infection Fatality Rate estimated by Driscol et al . ( 10 ) is applied on the infected population by age 303 group derived from the survey ( see detailed calculation in supplementary material ) . 304 Although we cannot exclude that we missed deaths directly related to COVID - 19 , the increase in 305 mortality detected by the survey during the pandemic may also be indirectly caused by decreased 306 access to care as evidenced by decreased attendance at health facilities and other potential adverse 307 effects of the pandemic . 308 The analysis of data from MSF health facilities showed a significant reduction in attendance during 309 the pandemic compared to the pre - pandemic period . The rates of consultations at primary health 310 centres as well as hospital admissions decreased by a third . However , the number of consultations at 311 the emergency room and the number of hospital deaths decreased less during the period , 312 potentially suggesting that access to health care for severe cases only moderately impacted . 313 .

For practical reasons , we were not able to do a population - based 314 sampling to estimate seroprevalence ; instead , we targeted the families of TBAs and CHWs as well as 315 patients and caretakers at health centres . This population is potentially different from the camp 316 population , both in terms of exposure to the virus and access to care . However , this population 317 originates from all geographical areas of the camp and includes all ages . The refusal rate was low 318 among patients and caretakers , decreasing the potential risk of selection bias . Among family 319 members of CHW and TBA , none who came to the study site declined to participate , but only 55 % 320 participated , which could potentially introduce bias . As the assessment of symptoms was based on 321 participant recall over a one - year period , recall bias may have occurred ; however , participants 322 reported symptoms before they knew their test result and a significant difference was detected 323 between seropositive and seronegative individuals . 324 Due to logistical and time constraints , only rapid tests were used . Rapid tests have less accuracy than 325 laboratory tests such as ELISA . Nevertheless , the BIOSYNEX test showed good performance in studies 326 conducted on subjects infected a few weeks before ( 4 ) . Certain types of antibodies decay over time 327 ( 11 ) , hence the sensitivity of the test may be affected . Cross - reactivity of the test that was used is 328 possible ; however , in a study conducted on a pre - pandemic sample from the Central African 329 Republic using three different rapid tests , BIOSYNEX showed the lowest rate of false positivity 330 ( 1 . 36 % ( 4 / 294 ) ) ( 12 ) . 331 .

( which was not certified by peer review ) The copyright holder for this preprint this version posted July 31 , 2021 . ; https : / / doi . org / 10 . 1101 / 2021 . 07 . 29 . 21261324 doi : medRxiv preprint 18 | P a g e The increase in mortality may also be due to the long recall period - The number of deaths may have 332 been underreported differentially or misclassified between the pre - pandemic and pandemic periods . 333 Respondents reported to CHWs that 39 % of deaths occurred in the hospital ( 42 % in the pre - 334 pandemic period and 36 % in the pandemic period ) . During this period , 221 deaths were recorded in 335 the hospital ( 140 pre - pandemic deaths and 81 pandemic deaths ) . Assuming the hospital database is 336 complete and the proportion of in - hospital deaths reported to CHWs is representative , the 337 projection gives 557 deaths ( 333 pre - pandemic deaths and 224 pandemic deaths ) , compared to 407 338 deaths reported to CHWs ( 200 pre - pandemic and 207 pandemic ) . This calculation suggests that the 339 survey may have underestimated the mortality rate by 37 % ; moreover , it suggests that the 340 underestimation was more important in the pre - pandemic period than in the pandemic period ( 66 % 341 versus 3 % ) . Lastly , this increase could be an artefact , as households that would have left the camp 342 during the recall period could not be included . 343 344 Conclusion 345 We estimated 67 times more infected cases than the number of cases reported in the camp . This 346 ratio cannot be fully explained by a high proportion of asymptomatic or pauci - symptomatic cases . A 347 significant proportion of the population remains susceptible , and our survey showed that the virus 348 circulates in the camp . The new , more transmissible , and potentially more severe ( 13 ) ( 14 ) variants 349 could have dramatic consequences in the camp . 350 Our survey showed an increase in the mortality rate during , compared to before , the pandemic . This 351 occurred in tandem with a sustained decline in attendance to health facilities despite the easing of 352 restrictions . Initiatives to restore the population ' s confidence and access to health care are urgently 353 needed . Furthermore , this study took place in a stable refugee camp with relatively good baseline 354 .

The situation of the more than 80 million forcibly 355 displaced people in the world varies greatly ; this merits further research in other sites to assess their 356 situation . Importantly , only large - scale vaccination of the population can limit the risk of excess 357 mortality from COVID - 19 . 358 359 List of abbreviations 360 CHWs : Community health workers 361 CI : Confidence interval 362 CMR : Crude mortality rate 363 MPH : Ministry of Public Health 364 MSF : Médecins Sans Frontières 365 CHW : Community health worker 366 TBA : Traditional birth attendant 367 Declarations 368 Ethics approval and consent to participate 369 This protocol was approved by the MSF Ethics Review Board ( V . 1 . 1 , 24 . 12 . 2020 , ID : 20105 ) and the 370 KEMRI SERU Scientific and Ethic Review Board ( KEMRI / SERU / CIPDR / 045 / 4164 ) .
