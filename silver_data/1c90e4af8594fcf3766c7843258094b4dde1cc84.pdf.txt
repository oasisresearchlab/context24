ABSTRACT Mammalian actin binding protein - 1 ( mAbp1 ) is an adaptor protein that binds actin and modulates scission during endocytosis . Recent studies suggest that mAbp1 impairs cell invasion , however the mechanism for the inhibitory effects of mAbp1 remains unclear . We performed a yeast - 2 - hybrid screen and identified the adaptor protein , FHL2 , as a novel binding partner that interacts with the N - terminal ADFH domain of mAbp1 . Here we report that depletion of mAbp1 or ectopic expression of the ADFH domain of mAbp1 increased Rho GTPase signaling and breast cancer cell invasion . Moreover , cell invasion induced by the ADFH domain of mAbp1 required the expression of FHL2 . Taken together , our findings show that mAbp1 and FHL2 are novel binding partners that differentially regulate Rho GTPase signaling and MTLn3 breast cancer cell invasion . INTRODUCTION Invasive migration of cancer cells is dependent on a dynamic actin cytoskeleton ( 1 ) . Key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton include actin binding proteins like cortactin , which have been implicated in invadopodia and podosome formation and invasive cell migration . Mammalian Actin binding protein - 1 ( mAbp1 , Hip - 55 , DBNL ) has significant structural homology to cortactin and binds actin with an N - terminal actin depolymerizing factor homology ( ADFH ) domain ( 2 ) . Both mAbp1 and cortactin have identified roles during endocytosis and vesicle trafficking ( 3 - 5 ) , and both proteins localize to lamellipodia , podosomes and dorsal ruffles ( 4 , 6 , 7 ) . However , in contrast to cortactin , mAbp1 impairs podosome formation and invasive migration of Src - transformed fibroblasts ( 8 ) . To determine how mAbp1 regulates cell invasion , we performed a Yeast - 2 - hybrid screen and identified the four - and - a - half LIM domain protein 2 ( FHL2 ) as a novel mAbp1 binding partner that does not interact with cortactin . FHL2 ( also known as DRAL or SLIM3 ) is a LIM domain protein consisting of four and one half LIM domains . Each LIM domain contains two zinc finger loops that mediate protein - protein interactions . FHL2 interacts with over 50 proteins ( 9 ) including integrins and FAK ( 10 , 11 ) , actin ( 12 ) , and the transcription factors ER , AP - 1 , and β - catenin ( 13 - 18 ) . Interestingly , FHL2 is expressed at low levels in many tissues like breast , placenta , uterus and the lungs ( 17 , 19 ) , and is upregulated in cancer . For example , FHL2 expression is increased in many cancers including http : / / www . jbc . org / cgi / doi / 10 . 1074 / jbc . M116 . 725739 The latest version is at JBC Papers in Press .

In primary breast tumors , patients with high levels of FHL2 have a poorer survival rate ( 21 ) , suggesting that FHL2 may be involved in cancer progression . Further , overexpression of FHL2 in MDA - MB - 231 human breast cancer cells enhances colony formation in soft agar while knock down reduces the ability to form colonies ( 20 ) . Here we report a novel interaction between the N - terminal ADFH domain of mAbp1 and FHL2 that modulates cell invasion . In the yeast but not the mammalian form , the N - terminus of Abp1 binds Arp2 / 3 , ( 28 , 29 ) . We have now identified a novel binding partner that interacts with the N - terminus of mAbp1 . We found that depletion of mAbp1 or ectopic expression of the ADFH domain enhances cell invasion . Moreover the increased invasion observed with ectopic expression of the ADFH domain requires expression of FHL2 . Our findings suggest that mAbp1 inhibits invasive migration of breast cancer cells at least in part through its interaction with FHL2 and the modulation of Rho GTPase signaling . These results identify a novel role for the interaction between mAbp1 and FHL2 in modulating MTLn3 breast cancer cell invasion .

Cell Transfections : Transient transfections of MTLn3 cells were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 ( Invitrogen , Carlsbad , CA ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . In brief , 1 x 10 5 cells were cultured in a 6 well plate and 2 µ g of DNA and 3 µ l of lipofectamine 2000 reagent were used .

Cells were incubated with the transfection mixture four hours before washing 3x with PBS . Cells then were cultured by standard methods as described in “ cell culture” . HEK 293 transient transfections were performed by the standard calcium phosphate precipitation method . All cells , with the exception of HEK 293 ( cultured at 10 % CO 2 ) were maintained at 5 % CO 2 at 37 ˚C . DNA and siRNA constructs - All constructs were generated by PCR amplification of product with cut sites in the primers as follows : Full length human mAbp1 , and the ADFH , PR , or SH3 domains of mAbp1 were cloned into the pEGFP - C1 vector using the XhoI and BamHI cut sites .

Retroviral transduction of cells : Stable knockdown MTLn3 lines were generated with the pSUPER . retro RNAi system per the manufacturer’s instructions ( OligoEngine , Seattle , WA ) . Briefly , to generate retrovirus for infection of MTLn3 cells , we plated 3 x 10 6 PhxA cells on a 10 cm dish . The PhxA cells were transfected with 12 µ g of DNA using the calcium phosphate precipitation procedure . 24 hour virus was discarded , and 4 ml of new media was added . The 48 hour and 72 hour retrovirus was harvested , filtered through a 0 . 2 µ m syringe filter and mixed with 1x polybrene before adding to a 6 cm dish of 1 x 10 5 MTLn3 cells . Cells incubated in retrovirus mixture for 6 hours at 32 ˚C . Retroviral media was removed and cells recovered in standard media for 24 hours before selection . Cells containing retrovirus were selected with 1 µ g / ml puromycin ( Sigma - Aldrich , St . Louis , MO ) for 5 days . Retroviral transduction of MDA - MB - 231 cells were performed similarly with the exception that virus from 24 , 48 , 72 , and 96 hours were used for infection and virus containing media remained on cells 24 hours instead of 6 . This longer infection was necessary for successful transduction of these cells . The most efficient rat mAbp1 shRNA target sequences were at nucleotides 1334 sense : GATCCCCGTGGCTTCCTTGTTGCCTATTCAAGAGATAGGCAACAAGGAAGCCACTTTTTA , 1334 antisense : AGCTTAAAAAGTGGCTTCCTTGTTGCCTATCTCTTGAATAGGCAACAAGGAAGCCACGGG and 1464 sense : GATCCCCATGCTTACCGCAGCCTCTATTCAAGAGATAGAGGCTGCGGTAAGCATTTTTTA , 1464 antisense : AGCTTAAAAAATGCTTACCGCAGCCTCTAT CTCTTGAATAGAGGCTGCGGTAAGCATGGG .

Collagen Contraction - Collagen contraction experiments were performed as follows : Desired volume of collagen was mixed 1 : 1 with 150 mM HEPES ( Cellgro , Menassas , VA ) in 2x PBS for a stock concentration of 4 . 5 mg / ml collagen and incubated on ice . 1 x 10 6 MDA - MB - 231 cells were counted and resuspended in 656 µ l of media . 444 µ l of collagen stock was mixed with cells for a final collagen concentration of 2 mg / ml and immediately transferred to one well of a 6 well plate . Plate was rocked to spread collagen across entire surface then cultured at 37 ˚C for one hour to polymerize . When polymerized , 2 ml of media were added to a t V I VA , U n i v o f V i r g i n i a on M a y 11 , 2016 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m mAbp1 inhibits FHL2 cell invasion 4 well and collagen was loosened from well with gentle rocking . Cells were cultured and images were taken at 24 hours and 48 hours . Percent contraction was quantified on metamorph imaging software . Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation - Cells were scraped into lysis buffer ( 20 mM HEPES , 50 mM KCl , 1 mM EDTA , 1 % NP40 , 0 . 2 mM PMSF , 1 µg / ml pepstatin , 2 µg / ml aprotinin , and 1 µg / ml leupeptin ) on ice , and clarified by centrifugation . Protein concentrations were determined with a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . Equal protein levels were denatured in SDS and loaded on 4 – 20 % SDS polyacrylamide gradient gels . Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose , probed with the appropriate antibodies and imaged with an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System ( Li - Cor Biosciences , Lincoln , NE ) . For GFP immunoprecipitation experiments , transiently transfected HEK 293 cells were cultured to approximately 80 % confluency on 10 cm plates , washed once with PBS , and lysed in lysis buffer . Lysates were clarified by centrifugation and incubated with 3 µg rb - anti - GFP antibody . Immune complexes were captured on Gammabind G - Sepharose beads ( GE - Healthcare ) , washed three times in lysis buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting . Rho Pull down Assay - Rho GTPase pull - down assays were performed with Rhotekin - RBD Protein GST beads ( Cytoskeleton , Inc . ) according the manufacturer’s instr uctions with some modifications . In brief , 3 x 10 6 MTLn3 cells were cultured on 15 cm dishes , serum starved for 24 hours , then treated with 5 nM EGF for five minutes . Cells were immediately lysed on ice in Rho lysis buffer ( 50mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 10 mM MgCl 2 , 100 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , and 1 % PMSF , Leupeptin , and Aprotinin ) and centrifuged at 14 , 000 rpm for 5 minutes for clarification . A sample of lysate was removed for western blot loading control and the remainder of lysate was placed in a tube containing 60 µ g Rhotekin - RBD beads to capture active Rho . Tubes were incubated 30 minutes at 4˚C before centrifuging one minute at 1 , 000 rpm and washing 3x with wash buffer ( 25 mM Tris pH 7 . 5 , 30 mM MgCl 2 , 40 mM NaCl , and 1 % PMSF , leupeptin and aprotinin ) . Meanwhile , the positive and negative control lysates were incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes with 15 mM EDTA and 0 . 2 mM GTP γ S or 1 mM GDP , respectively . GTP γ S is a non - hydrolysable GTP analog so that active Rho is pulled down from cell lysates . GDP inactivates Rho and blocks its binding to Rhotekin RBD beads . MgCl ( 60 mM final concentration ) was added to stop all reactions and lysates were incubated on rhotekin beads and washed as described above . All samples were run on SDS - PAGE . The amount of Rho pulled down was calculated by densitometry analysis of western blots . The ratio of active Rho pulled down to input Rho was calculated first . Then the ratio of active Rho pulled down per condition was normalized to control shRNA cells . Cell Fractionation - Cell fractionation was performed as previously described ( 32 ) . In brief , cells were scraped from confluent 10 cm dishes on ice into 1 ml ice - cold PBS . Cells were briefly centrifuged and supernatant was removed . Cells were then resuspended in 900 µ l 0 . 1 % NP - 40 in PBS and titrated 3x . 300 µ l of lysate was removed as whole cell lysate . Remaining lysate was briefly centrifuged and supernatant was removed as the cytosolic fraction . Nuclear pellet was resuspended in 180 µ l SDS buffer . Samples were loaded on SDS page and analyzed on western blot . Immunofluorescence - Coverslips were acid - washed , ethanol sterilized , coated with 2 mg / ml gelatin , and were subsequently coated with 10 µg / ml fibronectin overnight at 4°C . 3 . 0 × 10 4 cells were plated in α MEM media on coverslips for 6 hours at 37°C and 5 % CO 2 . Cells were fixed with 3 . 7 % formaldehyde for 10 minutes , quenched with 0 . 15 M glycine for 10 minutes , permeabilized with 0 . 2 % Triton X - 100 for 10 minutes , washed with PBS three times , and blocked with 5 % goat serum for 1 hour or overnight at 4°C . Cells were incubated with primary antibody and / or phalloidin for minimum of 1 hour , washed , then incubated with fluorophore - conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 hour . Cells were imaged either with a Zeiss Observer Z . 1 inverted microscope or with a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope . On the Zeiss Observer Z . 1 inverted microscope , images were captured with a Coolsnap ES 2 camera or with an a t V I VA , U n i v o f V i r g i n i a on M a y 11 , 2016 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m mAbp1 inhibits FHL2 cell invasion 5 Evolve 512 Delta EM - CCD camera for confocal mode ( Photometrics , Huntington Beach , CA ) using a 63x oil / NA 1 . 4 Plan Apo immersion objective ( Zeiss Immersol 518F oil ) and processed with Zen ( blue edition ) software ( Carl Zeiss ) .

Invasion assays - Cells were serum starved for 24 hours and 2 x 10 5 cells were seeded into top chamber of 8 µm pore boyden chambers coated with Matrigel ( BD Biosystems ) . Serum starving media for MTLn3 cells contained 1 % FBS and antibiotics . Serum starving media for other cell types contained 0 . 2 % fatty acid free BSA and no serum . Cells were allowed to invade for 16 or 48 hours as indicated towards serum containing media . Cells were removed from the top chamber and cells remaining on the membrane were stained with a Hema - 3 stain kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientific , Waltham , MA ) . Cells were counted from 12 representative 20 × field of view images per condition from at least three independent experiments . All images were acquired with an Olympus 1X - 70 inverted microscope ( Olympus America , Melville , NY ) using a 20 × / NA 0 . 4 objective . Images were processed with Metavue imaging software v6 . 2 ( Universal Imaging , Downingtown , PA ) . Statistical analyses - Statistical analyses used were unpaired t - test or one - way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) with Tukey posttests . P < 0 . 05 was considered significant . RESULTS mAbp1 inhibits invasion of breast cancer cells - We previously reported that mAbp1 impairs the migration of Src - transformed NIH 3T3 cells ( 8 ) . To investigate whether mAbp1 also negatively regulates invasion of breast cancer cells , we depleted mAbp1 in MTLn3 and MDA - MB - 231 breast cancer cell lines using retroviral shRNA ( Fig . 1 A , B , H ) . Cell invasion through matrigel coated boyden chambers was enhanced 2 - 4 fold in mAbp1 - deficient breast cancer cell lines ( Fig . 1 C , D , I ) . This enhanced invasion was rescued to control levels with transient exogenous expression of GFP - mAbp1 in mAbp1 - deficient MTLn3 cells ( Fig . 1 F ) . GFP - tagged mAbp1 localized to the cytoplasm and perinuclear regions ( Fig . 1 G ) similar to endogenous mAbp1 as detected by immunofluorescence ( Fig . 1 B ) . Taken together , these findings identify an inhibitory role for mAbp1 during invasive migration of breast cancer cell lines . Invasive migration is dependent on Rho GTPase activity and high cell contractility . To determine how mAbp1 impairs cell invasion , we used MDA - MD - 231 cells that grow well in 3D collagen gels to examine how mAbp1 expression modulates cell contraction . We found that in accordance with increased invasion , depletion of mAbp1 increased the contraction of collagen gels , indicating that mAbp1 - deficient cells have enhanced cell contractility and force application in 3D collagen ( Fig . 1 J , K ) . Likewise , mAbp1 - deficient cells had higher RhoA activity ( Fig . 2 A , B ) . Cell forces are applied to the extracellular matrix via adhesion sites known as focal adhesions . We found that mAbp1 - deficient cells had larger focal adhesions and were more spread on 2 - D surfaces ( Fig . 2 C - F ) . Taken together , these results suggest that mAbp1 negatively regulates the invasion of breast cancer cells , at least in part through the modulation of Rho GTPase signaling . The inhibitory effect of mAbp1 on cell invasion requires the C - terminal SH3 domain - Mammalian Abp1 is an adaptor protein that binds to the actin cytoskeleton through its N - terminal ADFH domain and to dynamin ( 2 , 33 , 34 ) , WIP ( 7 ) and other proteins through its C - terminal SH3 domain ( Fig . 3 A ) . To determine whether the SH3 domain is necessary for the inhibitory effects of mAbp1 on invasion , we expressed either full - length mAbp1 , the ADFH domain alone or an SH3 domain mutant ( mAbp1 - W415K ) in mAbp1 - deficient MTLn3 cells and measured invasion through matrigel ( Fig . 3 A - D ) . mAbp1 depleted cells had increased invasion and expression of WT GFP - mAbp1 rescued this effect . Interestingly , expression of the GFP - mAbp1 - W415K or the GFP - ADFH domain alone was not sufficient for rescue ( Fig . 3 B - D ) . A caveat is that the expression levels of the ADFH domain were low in the rescue lines as shown by immunostaining ( Fig . 3 B ) . Regardless , these results suggest that a functional a t V I VA , U n i v o f V i r g i n i a on M a y 11 , 2016 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m mAbp1 inhibits FHL2 cell invasion 6 SH3 domain is necessary for the inhibitory effects of mAbp1 on invasion . We next asked if a functional SH3 domain was required for mAbp1 inhibition of RhoA activity . We overexpressed GFP , GFP - mAbp1 or GFP - mAbp1 - W415K in MTLn3 cells and pulled down active Rho from lysates ( Fig . 3 E , F ) . We found that RhoA activity was decreased with mAbp1 overexpression but not with mAbp1 - W415K , suggesting that the SH3 domain interactions are required for the regulation of Rho activity by mAbp1 . The N - terminal ADFH domain of mAbp1 interacts with FHL2 - To determine how mAbp1 inhibits invasive migration , we performed a Yeast - 2 - Hybrid screen with full - length human mAbp1 and identified several novel binding partners ( Table 1 ) . One protein of particular interest was FHL2 since it has been implicated in breast cancer progression . To confirm the interaction between mAbp1 and FHL2 , we performed in vitro GST pull down assays ( Fig . 4 A ) . Beads coated with GST alone did not pull down His - tagged FHL2 while beads coated with GST - mAbp1 interacted with His - FHL2 . To confirm the interaction in mammalian cells , we performed a co - immunoprecipitation experiment by pulling down endogenous FHL2 and probing for mAbp1 ( Fig . 4 B ) . In addition , we expressed GFP or GFP - mAbp1 with myc - FHL2 in HEK 293 cells and immunoprecipitated GFP ; myc - FHL2 interacted with GFP - mAbp1 but not GFP alone ( Fig . 4 C ) . To determine which mAbp1 domain interacts with FHL2 , we expressed either the GFP tagged ADFH domain , proline - rich region ( PR ) or the SH3 domain alone , along with His - FHL2 and performed co - immunoprecipitation experiments ( Fig . 4 D ) . Surprisingly , we found that FHL2 interacted with the ADFH domain but not the SH3 or PR regions of mAbp1 . Moreover , the interaction between FHL2 and the ADFH domain was more robust than the FHL2 interaction with full - length mAbp1 . This result suggests that the conformation of full - length mAbp1 may modulate FHL2 binding . Although GFP - ADFH domain expression was low relative to full - length GFP - mAbp1 ( as shown by immunofluorescence ) , immunoprecipitation of GFP enriched GFP - ADFH to comparable levels ( Fig . 4 D ) . Taken together , these findings suggest that FHL2 interacts directly with the ADFH domain of mAbp1 . Interestingly , the ADFH domain of mAbp1 is not conserved in cortactin , thus providing a key distinction between the binding partners of mAbp1 and cortactin . It is an intriguing idea that FHL2 interactions may play a role in the differential effects of mAbp1 and cortactin on cell invasion . FHL2 is necessary for invasive migration of breast cancer cells - FHL2 expression is upregulated in breast cancer ( 20 , 21 ) , however , the role of FHL2 during breast cancer cell invasion is not known . To determine how FHL2 affects invasive migration of breast cancer cells , we depleted FHL2 in MTLn3 cells using retroviral shRNA ( Fig . 5 A , B ) and found that even with a partial knockdown , invasive migration was significantly impaired ( Fig . 5 C , D ) . To confirm the role of FHL2 during invasive migration , FHL2 - deficient cell invasion was rescued with transient exogenous expression of RFP - FHL2 ( Fig . 5 E - G ) . Consistent with previous reports , exogenous RFP - FHL2 localized at focal adhesions and along stress fibers in MTLn3 cells ( Fig . 5 H ) . To determine if FHL2 modulates focal adhesions , we imaged focal adhesions and stress fibers in control and FHL2 - deficient cells . Similar to exogenous RFP - FHL2 expression , endogenous immunofluorescence of FHL2 was localized to focal adhesions and stress fibers ( Fig . 6 A ) . We found that FHL2 - deficient MTLn3 cells had reduced focal adhesion area , although the total numbers of focal adhesions were not significantly different ( Fig . 6 B , C ) . Accordingly , we also found that FHL2 - deficient cells had reduced RhoA activity by pull down assay in the presence of EGF stimulation ( Fig 6 D , E ) . These findings are consistent with the reported roles for FHL2 in heart muscle and contractility of the sarcomere ( 35 ) , wound healing ( 36 ) and the invasion of glioblastoma cells ( 25 , 26 ) . These findings suggest that FHL2 is necessary for efficient invasion of MTLn3 breast cancer cells , likely in part through its effects on Rho GTPase activity . The ADFH domain of mAbp1 increases invasive migration and this effect requires FHL2 - To determine whether mAbp1 affects invasion through its interaction with FHL2 , we overexpressed WT mAbp1 , ADFH domain alone , and mAbp1 - W415K and assessed invasion a t V I VA , U n i v o f V i r g i n i a on M a y 11 , 2016 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m mAbp1 inhibits FHL2 cell invasion 7 through matrigel in control and FHL2 - deficient cells ( Fig . 7 ) . As expected , overexpression of full - length GFP - mAbp1 in wild type cells impaired invasive migration . By contrast , ectopic expression of the ADFH domain alone dramatically increased invasive migration of MTLn3 cells ( Fig . 7 B , C ) , suggesting that the ADFH domain may block the inhibitory effects of endogenous mAbp1 on invasion . In support of this idea , we found that overexpression of the SH3 domain mutant ( GFP - mAbp1 - W415K ) also enhanced invasive migration . Our results support the hypothesis that mAbp1 binds FHL2 through the ADFH domain , and inhibits FHL2 invasive activity via its SH3 domain or its interactions . Although the enhanced invasion of full - length mAbp1 - W415K - expressing cells was not as dramatic as expression of the ADFH domain alone , this difference may be due to reduced levels of FHL2 interaction with full - length mAbp1 in comparison with the ADFH domain alone ( Figure 4 D ) . To determine how the interaction between mAbp1 and FHL2 modulates invasive cell migration , we determined if expression of FHL2 was necessary for the invasive migration induced by expression of the ADFH domain of mAbp1 . We found that FHL2 expression was required for the induction of invasive migration with ectopic expression of the ADFH domain or W415K - mAbp1 mutant ( Fig . 7 B , C ) . However , a potential caveat is that invasive migration may be dependent on FHL2 expression independent of mAbp1 effects . Taken together , these findings support the idea that mAbp1 sequesters FHL2 and impairs FHL2 - Rho signaling to affect cell invasion . Further , these results suggest that the inhibitory effect of mAbp1 on invasion requires the SH3 domain and its specific binding partners . DISCUSSION Here we report a novel interaction between mAbp1 and the multifunctional adaptor protein FHL2 . We show that mAbp1 impairs MTLn3 cell invasion and Rho GTPase signaling , while FHL2 increases MTLn3 invasion and RhoA activity . We show that mAbp1 interacts with FHL2 through its N - terminal ADFH domain . Our data suggest that mAbp1 regulates cell invasion at least in part through its effects on FHL2 and Rho GTPase activation . In support of this idea , expression of the ADFH domain of mAbp1 , lacking the inhibitory SH3 domain , is sufficient to induce invasive cell migration and this effect requires the expression of FHL2 . FHL2 is an adaptor protein that has known functions at focal adhesions and also may function as a transcriptional cofactor in the nucleus . The interaction between mAbp1 and FHL2 is particularly interesting since FHL2 is up - regulated during invasive migration of metastatic osteosarcoma cells , colon cancer and glioblastomas ( 25 , 26 , 38 ) , and has been implicated in migration during wound closure ( 20 , 21 , 25 , 36 ) . In colon cancer , FHL2 promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition by suppressing E - cadherin and promoting vimentin and MMP - 9 expression ( 25 , 39 ) ; while in - vitro , FHL2 has been shown to alter transactivation of key breast cancer related genes ( 13 , 17 , 18 ) . Although FHL2 expression can alter the invasive capacity of cancer cells , it remains unclear whether FHL2 modulates cell invasion through its effects at focal adhesions or its transcription cofactor activity . Our findings suggest that FHL2 and mAbp1 regulate cell invasion through effects on focal adhesions and the activation of Rho GTPase signaling . Cell motility and invasion are dependent on the tight regulation of Rho - ROCK signaling and cell contractility ( 40 - 43 ) . Inhibition of Rho or ROCK impairs breast cancer invasion ( 44 ) and metastasis in vivo ( 45 ) . Our work suggests that the actin binding protein mAbp1 and FHL2 play opposing roles in modulating RhoA activity and cell invasion . We found that mAbp1 inhibits cellular contraction of collagen and inhibits RhoA activity while FHL2 facilitates RhoA activation . Not surprisingly , the activity of RhoA correlated with the invasive potential of mAbp1 and FHL2 depleted breast cancer cell lines . Future work will be needed to determine whether FHL2 and its interaction with mAbp1 regulate actomyosin contraction and invasive migration in 3 - D or within tissues in vivo . Our findings suggest that the SH3 domain of mAbp1 is necessary for the inhibitory effects of mAbp1 on cell invasion . Moreover , our results suggest that mAbp1 may inhibit invasion by a t V I VA , U n i v o f V i r g i n i a on M a y 11 , 2016 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m mAbp1 inhibits FHL2 cell invasion 8 sequestering FHL2 and that this inhibitory effect requires the SH3 domain of mAbp1 . Interestingly , we found that FHL2 interacted more strongly with the ADFH domain of mAbp1 as compared to full - length mAbp1 , suggesting that the conformation of full - length mAbp1 may regulate the interaction between mAbp1 and FHL2 . Overexpression of the ADFH domain in cells with endogenous mAbp1 resulted in enhanced invasion that was dependent on FHL2 expression , suggesting that the ADFH domain was sufficient to overcome the inhibitory effects of full length mAbp1 on cell invasion . An increased affinity of the ADFH domain for FHL2 may be sufficient to block endogenous mAbp1 binding to FHL2 thereby modulating FHL2 function and Rho GTPase signaling . These results suggest that the mAbp1 - FHL2 interaction may be regulated by conformational changes in mAbp1 potentially through phosphorylation , additional protein interactions , SH3 domain modifications or protease activity . Recently , putative phosphorylation sites have been identified by mass spectrometry of His - tagged mAbp1 in HEK 293 cells ( 46 ) . Serine 99 and threonine 114 are both located in the ADFH domain and are attractive targets that may alter FHL2 binding . mAbp1 serine 269 is also an interesting potential regulatory target since phosphorylation of mAbp1 on serine 269 by the maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase ( MELK ) promotes tumor growth and invasion of MCF - 7 breast cancer cells . Our work is the first to suggest that endogenous mAbp1 functions as an inhibitor of cancer cell invasion . It will be interesting to determine if phosphorylation of S269 affects the interaction between mAbp1 and FHL2 and cell invasion ( 47 ) . Furthermore , it is intriguing that serine 269 is close to the calpain - 2 cleavage sites of mAbp1 ( 30 ) . Calpain - 2 activity is required for the invasion of several cancer cell lines including breast cancer ( 48 - 51 ) . Calpain - 2 cleavage of mAbp1 would effectively separate the N - terminal ADFH domain from the regulatory C - terminal SH3 domain and thus could alter cell invasion , possibly through ADFH interactions with FHL2 . These possible modes of regulation of the mAbp1 - FHL2 interaction remain to be tested and will provide further insight into potential targets that modulate the invasive migration of cancer cells .
