Traub Dissertation Advisor Department of Cell Biology and Physiology iii Copyright © by James Thieman 2011 iv Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is a selective pathway for the entry of transmembrane proteins into the cell through the generation of a short - lived vesicular intermediate . Cells and tissues depend on this process for obtaining nutrients , modulation of signaling and cell migration . The clathrin - coated structure intermediate is assembled on the plasma membrane from a cohort of 20 - 30 distinct proteins that aid in cargo selection , scaffolding , membrane bending and scission of the vesicle . Exactly how these complex assemblies are nucleated at the plasma membrane remains unclear although the lipid phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) plays an important role by anchoring many of the endocytic components . The work in this thesis helps to clarify the nucleation phase by describing the molecular details of the interaction between a PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - generating lipid kinase PIPKI γ and the heterotetrameric clathrin adaptor AP - 2 . By engaging a subdomain on the AP - 2 β 2 subunit appendage , the kinase is strategically positioned at assembly sites to generate PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and drive coat assembly forward . Clathrin binds to the same subdomain on the β 2 appendage but with a higher apparent affinity . I therefore invoke a model in which PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 production for nucleation is negatively regulated by PIPKI γ displacement from AP - 2 by clathrin at later stages of assembly . I also demonstrate that a cargo - sorting alternate adaptor that binds to the other subsite on the AP - 2 β 2 appendage is not subject to displacement by clathrin during clathrin - coated vesicle budding , ensuring non - competitive cargo incorporation into the vesicle . Finally , the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding EFC domain proteins Regulation of clathrin - coated vesicle nucleation James R . Thieman , PhD University of Pittsburgh , 2011 v FCHO1 and FCHO2 have been proposed to act as dedicated nucleators of clathrin - coated structures on the plasma membrane . I demonstrate in multiple cell lines that these proteins are not invariantly required for placement of clathrin - coated assemblies on the plasma membrane despite being early arriving components themselves . FCHO1 / 2 are involved in the regulation of the size and number of these assemblies in some cellular contexts . My data support the model of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 regulated , not protein regulated , nucleation of clathrin - coated structures ; however multiple parallel pathways may contribute to initiation of endocytic buds . vi TABLE OF CONTENTS PREFACE . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Linton Traub for his personal investment in my training . Linton has profoundly affected the way I think , write and speak , has sparked my curiosity and has taught me the value of questioning my assumptions . He is a gifted and modest scientist and I am fortunate to have his friendship . I would like to thank the members of my committee for their support during my studies , especially Dr . Simon Watkins . Simon has helped me discover my passion for biological imaging , has provided invaluable career advice and opportunities and has acted as a second mentor . Dr . Gerry Apodaca has been instrumental in solidifying my interest in science by inviting me into his lab for two summers as an undergraduate student . Dr . Meir Aridor has challenged me to think more deeply about my project . Dr . Sandro Bisello has provided me with exceptional training during my rotation in his lab and has provided insightful advice through the years . I am thankful for the friendship and assistance of all Traub laboratory members , past and present : Dr . Sanjay Mishra for teaching me much of what I know of biochemistry , Amie Steinhauser , Peter Keyel and Matthew Hawryluk for their friendship , Drs . S . Sanker , P . K . Umasankar and Souvik Chakraborty for making the lab an enjoyable and dynamic place in recent years , and xvii Anupma Jha for sharing in the trials and tribulations of graduate school . Thank you also to Andrew and Annie Steiner , for making my time during my graduate work unforgettable . I would especially like to thank my family . I have been blessed to have wonderful parents , Jim and Gail Thieman , who have put my education , personal growth and faith before their own needs . They have taught me the importance of hard work and integrity and I love them dearly .

Eukaryotic cells have evolved a cohort of membrane - bound organelles that facilitate numerous biochemical reactions and serve to separate these reactions in space and time , while prokaryotes have not ( Alberts et al . , 2002 ) . These organelles contain three - dimensional aqueous reaction vessel lumens of varying molarities and pH and an encompassing two - dimensional lipid membrane scaffold . This type of static representation of eukaryotic cell structure fails to convey the immense effort cells make in order to maintain homeostasis . Continual energy expenditure must be made to target proteins and lipids to the correct sub - cellular location and to prevent passive transport of inappropriate molecules , as well as to retrieve membrane that prevents organelle contraction and expansion . Not surprisingly , complex and conserved mechanisms have evolved to control intracellular traffic . The existence of sub - cellular organelles has been known since the 19 th century , however our understanding of communication between these organelles only began to take shape in the 1960s through the work of George Palade . Working with pancreatic exocrine cells , Palade 2 showed that newly synthesized proteins destined for secretion are first translocated into the endoplasmic reticulum ( ER ) and then sequentially transit through the Golgi complex , secretory granules and finally the extracellular space ( Palade , 1975 ) . Non - secreted proteins that reside at the plasma membrane , endosomes and lysosome also pass through some of these common compartments . Palade noted that the compartments maintain their identity over time and postulated that secretory proteins shuttle between them in transport vesicles . In time , Palade’s work gave rise to the generalized vesicle transport hypothesis ( Bonifacino and Glick , 2004 ) : A donor membrane generates a small ( ~ 50 - 100 nm ) vesicle into which proteins ( soluble and membrane - bound ) are packaged , the vesicle travels to a target membrane and fusion of the two lipid bilayers releases the contents into the target . Further substantiating the vesicle transport model and initiating the molecular characterization of this process was work by the Schekman and Rothman laboratories . A screen for Saccharomyces cerevisiae secretion or sec mutants by Schekman’s group revealed 23 complementation groups that displayed morphologic phenotypes associated with altered vesicular transport : 1 . accumulation of small vesicles , 2 . an enlarged ER network and 3 . an abnormal Golgi complex ( Novick et al . , 1980 ) . Over the following two decades the sec proteins were identified and characterized as components of the vesicle generation and fusion machinery ( Schekman and Novick , 2004 ) . In a different in vitro approach by Rothman’s laboratory , donor membrane Golgi fractions lacking an enzyme necessary for the synthesis of complex oligosaccharides generation on the viral glycoprotein ( G protein ) from Vesicular Stomatitis Virus ( VSV - G ) infected cells were mixed with a wild - type acceptor membrane Golgi fraction . The further processing of viral glycoprotein N - linked sugars was monitored to follow transport between Golgi cisternae ( Balch et al . , 1984a ; Balch et al . , 1984b ; Braell et al . , 1984 ) . VSV - G , 3 starting in the donor Golgi became fully processed despite the seemingly maintained integrity of the Golgi fractions . These experiments strongly suggested that cellular proteins are shuttled by vesicles to their destination . 1 . 1 . 2 Coated vesicles Working in the same years as Palade , Thomas Roth and Keith Porter discovered a common theme in vesicular transport : generation of trafficking vesicles occurs through a coated vesicle intermediate . As will become apparent in later sections , protein coats fulfill three main functions during vesicle formation : 1 . assistance in deforming the membrane , 2 . uniformity in size of generated vesicles and 3 . selection of integral membrane proteins destined for transport , hereafter referred to as ‘cargo’ . 1 . 1 . 2 . 1 Clathrin - coated vesicles Roth and Porter were interested in how circulating proteins within female mosquito hemolymph were deposited as yolk inside developing oocytes ( Roth and Porter , 1964 ) . They noticed that shortly following a blood meal , a proliferation of “bristle - coated pits and vesicles” on the cytoplasmic surface of the mosquito oocyte plasma membrane occurs . These pits and vesicles contained three distinguishable layers by electron microscopy : an inner , extracellular / luminal layer corresponding to massed yolk protein , a middle layer of ~ 75 - Å corresponding to the bilayer membrane , and an outer layer ~ 200 - Å thick that resembled a coat of fibrous bristles in the thin sections . Most remarkably , they correctly predicted from static images that these coated pits likely operated as a shuttle by concentrating yolk , budding from the surface , uncoating and fusing to form the large mature yolk bodies seen in mosquito oocytes . Coated vesicles are not 4 restricted to the endocytic pathway and were subsequently observed on the Golgi complex ( Friend and Farquhar , 1967 ) where they are involved in anterograde biosynthetic traffic . The ensuing decade was dedicated to isolating coated vesicles and biochemically characterizing them . Fractionation of guinea pig brain and electron microscopic observation revealed that coated vesicles were ~ 50 nm diameter vesicles surrounded by a ~ 100 nm diameter cage of pentagonal and hexagonal facets ( Kanaseki and Kadota , 1969 ) . By purifying these vesicles biochemically , Barbara Pearse identified the main proteinaceous component of coated vesicles as a ~ 180 kDa protein that she named clathrin ( Pearse , 1975 , 1976 ) . Trimerization of clathrin heavy chain molecules into a three - legged triskelion that also contains three 25 - 29 kDa associated clathrin light chain polypeptides was found to be the basic structural unit of these coated vesicle cages ( Ungewickell and Branton , 1981 ) . Less abundant , and initially overlooked , associated proteins ( APs ) of ~ 110 , 50 and 16 kDa isolated with coated vesicles were subsequently shown to promote clathrin triskelion polymerization in vitro ( Keen et al . , 1979 ) and were re - dubbed ‘assembly polypeptides’ for APs ( Keen , 1987 ) . Clathrin - coated vesicles ( CCVs ) are now known to coordinate trafficking of cargo both from the plasma membrane during endocytosis and in biosynthetic traffic out of the trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) and on endosomes in endocytic trafficking . The molecular details of coat - directed vesicle assembly will be discussed below . 1 . 1 . 2 . 2 COPI coated vesicles The generality of the use of protein coats for vesicle formation was extended when ultrastructural examination of the Golgi revealed coated buds that were not immunoreactive for clathrin ( Griffiths et al . , 1985 ; Orci et al . , 1985 ) . Closer analysis demonstrated these coats were morphologically different from clathrin and appeared as ‘obtuse spikes’ ( Orci et al . , 1986 ) . 5 Biochemical purification of protein components of this coat gave rise to the name Golgi coat promoter or Coatomer ( Waters et al . , 1991 ) and later COPI coats . COPI coats are now known to be important in the early secretory pathway where they mediate retrograde transport between Golgi cisternae , from the Golgi to the ER and also , possibly , in anterograde transport from the ER - Golgi Intermediate Complex to the Golgi ( Beck et al . , 2009 ) . It was likely the transport of oligosaccharide - processing enzymes between Golgi fractions in COPI vesicles that allowed VSV - G to mature in the Rothman experiments ( Balch et al . , 1984a ; Balch et al . , 1984b ) . The COPI coat recognizes specific amino - acid tracts or sorting signals within cargo , in this case typically ER resident proteins , for inclusion into budding vesicles . This process is termed cargo selection and is another common theme of vesicular transport as discussed below . 1 . 1 . 2 . 3 COPII coated vesicles In contrast to the purely morphological initial discovery of clathrin and COPI coats , a third , ER - derived coated vesicle was discovered as a result of its in vitro reconstitution ( Barlowe et al . , 1994 ) . COPII coated vesicles are formed at distinct ER exit sites from the progressive assembly of the Sar1 Guanosine triphosphate ( GTP ) ase , the Sec23 / 24 inner coat , and Sec13 / 31 outer coat ( Miller and Barlowe , 2010 ) that culminates in the release of small ( ~ 60 nm ) vesicles ( Barlowe et al . , 1994 ) . Many of the sec mutants possess mutations in genes for the COPII coat or its regulatory factors ( Schekman and Novick , 2004 ) . Assembling COPII buds segregate cargo for export from resident ER proteins through the recognition of diacidic and dihydrophobic sorting signals in the cytosolic portion of transmembrane cargo or soluble cargo receptors ( Aridor et al . , 1998 ; Barlowe , 2003 ) . 6 1 . 2 THE ENDOCYTIC PATHWAY Cells , both in multicellular organisms and free - living unicellular organisms , do not operate in complete isolation but must interact with their environment . The plasma membrane represents a barrier between the potentially harsh surroundings and the cell’s controlled cytosol . The cell must continually respond to its environment and can accomplish this in part by actively adjusting the protein and lipid composition of the plasma membrane . This is often handled by endocytosis , the invagination and vesiculation / tubulation of a region of plasma membrane entrapping a volume of extracellular fluid and integral membrane proteins in the immediate region . Delivery of the vesicle / tubule to internal membranes then allows degradation or recycling of the internalized contents . Because of the complexity of cell - cell , cell - tissue and cell - organism communication , mammalian cells have evolved a multitude of endocytic pathways each with different functions to effectively interact with and respond to their environment . 1 . 2 . 1 Clathrin - independent endocytosis Endocytic pathways are first characterized by their dependence on or independence of a clathrin coat . Within the clathrin - independent endocytosis ( CIE ) branch , internalization is further classified by size ( Mayor and Pagano , 2007 ) . Macropinocytosis is the internalization of large volumes of extracellular fluid through membrane extensions that fuse with each other or back onto the plasma membrane producing vesicles on the order of > 1 µ m ( Kerr and Teasdale , 2009 ) . Macropinocytosis is tied to the formation of circular dorsal ruffles , can be stimulated by various growth factors , and requires the actin cytoskeleton and the Rho family GTPase Rac1 ( Doherty and McMahon , 2009 ) . One natural function of macropinocytosis is fluid - phase sampling of the 7 environment for antigen presentation by immune cells , though a variety of pathogens can induce macropinosome formation for their host entry ( Kerr and Teasdale , 2009 ) . Phagocytosis is an endocytic pathway for the internalization of large ( > 1 µ m ) solid particles into cells . Professional phagocytic cells , including macrophages , monocytes and neutrophils in mammals , engulf opsonized pathogens or apoptotic cell bodies through actin - enriched membrane protrusions ( Doherty and McMahon , 2009 ) . There appears to be at least two distinct phagocytic pathways : internalization of IgG opsonized particles ligated to its receptor Fc γ R in a mainly Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPase dependent pathway and uptake of C3bi - coated particles by the complement receptor CR3 in a mainly RhoA GTPase dependent manner ( Groves et al . , 2008 ) . There also exist multiple clathrin - independent pathways for generating trafficking vesicles on a smaller order ( < 1 µ m ) and pinocytic ( fluid - phase ) in nature ( Mayor and Pagano , 2007 ) . The best characterized of these is caveolar endocytosis . Caveolae are 50 - 80 nm flask - shaped plasma membrane invaginations that are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids ( Hansen and Nichols , 2010 ) . One of the primary functions of caveolae is in transcytosis of serum factors in endothelial cells ( Oh et al . , 2007 ) such as albumin ( Schubert et al . , 2001 ) . Caveolae are also subverted for simian virus 40 entry ( Anderson et al . , 1996 ) . Caveolae have a striated coat by electron microscopy formed by the proteins caveolins and cavins , but how these structures contribute to function or endocytosis is not clear ( Hansen and Nichols , 2010 ) . New data suggest caveolae are membrane reservoirs to regulate surface tension ( Sinha et al . , 2011 ) . Finally , there are a number of other clathrin and caveolin - independent endocytic pathways that appear to operate in the absence of a morphologically discernable coat and require Rho / ADP ribosylation factor ( Arf ) family GTPases . For example , tubular and ring - like plasma 8 membrane invaginations called Clathrin - and Dynamin - independent Carriers ( CLICs ) endocytose glycosylphosphatidylinositol - anchored proteins and Cholera toxin B in a process dependent on Cdc42 GTPase ( Kirkham et al . , 2005 ; Mayor and Pagano , 2007 ) . The variability in mechanisms to generate non - clathrin endocytic vesicles / phagosomes / macropinosomes may reflect the unique challenges or range of cargo encountered at the interface between various cell types and their environment . Many questions pertaining to the mechanics and cargo selection of CIE pathways remain . 1 . 2 . 2 Clathrin - mediated endocytosis By far the best - characterized endocytic pathway at the morphological , biochemical , structural and mechanistic levels is that generating CCVs . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( CME ) plays critical roles in nutrient absorption such as for the transferrin ( Tf ) receptor ( TfR ) and low density lipoprotein receptor ( LDLR ) ( Orci et al . , 1978 ; Booth and Wilson , 1981 ) , modulation of signal transduction through downregulation of surface receptors ( Le Roy and Wrana , 2005 ) , cell migration ( Nishimura and Kaibuchi , 2007 ) and neurotransmission ( Smith et al . , 2008 ) . In the standard textbook model , clathrin - coated pits ( CCPs ) , or more appropriately clathrin - coated structures ( CCSs ) , are generated anew from the progressive accumulation of adaptors and clathrin from a soluble pool on a region of the plasma membrane ( Alberts et al . , 2002 ) . A layered assembly is created with the cargo - laden plasma membrane on the inside , a middle adaptor layer bound to cargo and an outer clathrin coat layer attached to the adaptor layer . Increasing curvature of the nascent bud is accompanied by concentration of cargo molecules ( Figure 1 . 1 ) . Finally the GTPase dynamin oligomerizes at the neck and promotes scission of the vesicle followed shortly by uncoating and recycling of the endocytic components . 9 Figure 1 . 1 : Clathrin - coated pit and vesicle formation . Clathrin - coated pits form through successive steps . On a patch of the plasma membrane , AP - 2 adaptors and clathrin - associated sorting proteins ( CLASPs ) are recruited during the nucleation phase . If the assembly fails to stabilize the components are released and dissolution occurs . If the components are stabilized through binding transmembrane cargo receptors , the assembly continues through a growth phase during which more cargo is concentrated and clathrin trimers are polymerized into a coat . When the assembly is deeply invaginated , Dynamin GTPase assembles at the neck to promote scission with the help of actin - mediated tension . After budding the coat is disassembled and coat components are recycled for further rounds of endocytosis . Image modified from ( Traub , 2009 ) . 1 . 3 COMPONENTS AND ASSEMBLY OF CLATHRIN - COATED STRUCTURES 1 . 3 . 1 Clathrin As described above , clathrin is a trimer of three heavy chains with three associated light chains forming a triskelion . The triskelion contains three - fold rotational symmetry about the heavy chain C - terminal trimerization domain ( Ungewickell and Branton , 1981 ) . Each heavy chain leg is kinked and contains a straight , helical proximal segment , a flexible knee , a straight , helical distal segment , a straight , helical ankle segment and an N - terminal , β - propeller fold terminal domain ( Figure 1 . 2A ) ( Edeling et al . , 2006b ) . 10 In an assembled clathrin lattice , a single triskelion vertex is present at each corner between adjacent hexagon – hexagon or hexagon – pentagon facets . Triskelion self - assembly is accomplished through anti - parallel binding of proximal and distal leg segments ( Fotin et al . , 2004 ) . In this configuration many terminal domains are clustered beneath the polygonal lattice specifically below vertices ( see Figure 1 . 6 ) ( Edeling et al . , 2006b ) . This architecture is important as clathrin has no inherent affinity for the plasma membrane and binds via interactions with the adaptor layer through its terminal domains ( Unanue et al . , 1981 ) . Figure 1 . 2 : Organization of clathrin and AP - 2 . ( A ) Clathrin heavy chains ( red ) trimerize at their C - termini to form a triskelion . A straight segment adjacent to the trimerization domain is the proximal leg , followed by the knee , distal leg , ankle and the terminal domain . One clathrin light chain ( green ) binds to one heavy chain along the proximal leg . The triskelion is curved , projecting the terminal domains down . ( B ) AP - 2 is a heterotetramer composed of two large subunits , α ( blue ) and β 2 ( green ) , a medium subunit µ 2 ( magenta ) and a small subunit σ 2 ( orange ) . All four subunits fold compactly into a brick - like core . The large subunits have an unstructured C - terminus ( hinge ) that ends in an independently folded appendage domain . Regions on the β 2 subunit that bind clathrin are denoted by gold circles . 11 1 . 3 . 2 The heterotetrameric adaptor AP - 2 In order to act as a mechanical scaffold for vesicle formation , clathrin binds to adaptors that themselves bind to the membrane as well as cargo molecules . For this reason , the originally named ‘assembly polypeptides’ ( Keen , 1987 ) have more commonly assumed the name ‘adaptor proteins’ as they can link clathrin assembly to cargo selection . The AP family is composed of four heterotetrameric protein complexes ( AP - 1 – 4 ) that are ubiquitously expressed ( Boehm and Bonifacino , 2001 ) . The APs each contain two large ( ~ 100 - 140 kDa ) subunits : γ , α , δ , ε and β 1 - 4 , one medium ( ~ 50 kDa ) subunit : µ 1 - 4 and one small ( ~ 20 kDa ) subunit : σ 1 - 4 for AP - 1 through AP - 4 , respectively . These adaptors regulate CCV formation ( AP - 1 and AP - 2 ) or vesicle formation ( AP - 3 and AP - 4 ) at different subcellular domains : AP - 2 at the plasma membrane and AP - 1 , AP - 3 and AP - 4 at the TGN and endosomes ( Nakatsu and Ohno , 2003 ) . Further discussion will focus on how AP - 2 coordinates endocytosis at the plasma membrane . Biochemical and structural studies have greatly advanced our knowledge of how AP - 2 functions in CCV assembly . AP - 2 ( as well as AP - 1 , - 3 and - 4 ) consists of a brick - like core domain with two independently folded appendages connected by flexible , unstructured chains called the hinge domains ( Figure 1 . 2B ) ( Heuser and Keen , 1988 ) . The AP - 2 core is assembled from all four subunits : the α and β 2 N - termini , the µ 2 and the σ 2 . The α and β 2 subunit N - termini each have an alpha - solenoid fold with a sharp ~ 90 ° turn that creates a curved rectangle ( Collins et al . , 2002 ) . Tucked into the large subunit turns are the structurally analogous σ 2 for α and the µ 2 N - terminus for β 2 . The µ 2 subunit has a middle unstructured domain and C - terminal curved β - sheet domain . This µ 2 C - terminus fits neatly into the remaining space of the α / β 2 ‘bowl’ ( Collins et al . , 2002 ) . 12 Projecting off at the C - termini of α and β 2 are the unstructured hinge domains that end in the folded ‘appendage’ domains . Despite a low primary sequence conservation between the α and β 2 appendages , they share a similar tertiary structure ( Traub et al . , 1999 ; Owen et al . , 2000 ) , Both appendages can be further divided into an amino terminal sandwich subdomain , comprised of a β - sandwich fold , and a carboxyl terminal platform subdomain , formed by a combination of β - sheet and α helices . The AP - 2 appendage domains are critical to proper CME as they coordinate interactions with ~ 20 - 30 endocytic proteins including clathrin ( Mishra et al . , 2004 ; Edeling et al . , 2006a ) and antibodies that bind the α appendage ( AP . 6 ) interfere with Tf uptake when microinjected into cells ( Chin et al . , 1989 ) . The appendages will be discussed in greater detail below . Cargo molecules contain linear amino - acid sequences in their cytosolic aspects , known as sorting signals , for their positive - selection and incorporation into forming CCVs . As the most prominent component of CCVs after clathrin , AP - 2 is the prototypical adaptor for cargo selection . The µ 2 subunit of AP - 2 specifically recognizes tyrosine - based sorting signals of the consensus YXXØ ( where X is any amino acid and Ø is a bulky hydrophobic residue ) ( Ohno et al . , 1995 ; Owen and Evans , 1998 ) . AP - 2 can coordinate the simultaneous internalization of multiple sorting signal type containing cargo ( Table 1 . 1 ) . It also recognizes the consensus [ DE ] XXXL [ LI ] ( brackets indicate one of the contained residues ) through the σ 2 and α hemicomplex ( Doray et al . , 2007 ; Kelly et al . , 2008 ) . These different signals allow the non - competitive ( Warren et al . , 1997 ) constitutive endocytosis of a variety of receptors . Interestingly in the ‘closed’ conformation the µ 2 C - terminal domain and σ 2 / α hemicomplex cargo sites are blocked by the β 2 subunit ( Collins et al . , 2002 ) and must undergo rearrangement to accommodate cargo . This suggests recognition of sorting signals is not what recruits AP - 2 to the 13 plasma membrane and agrees with failure of AP - 2 to bind to endosomes that are rich in TfR and LDLR . 1 . 3 . 3 Monomeric adaptors 1 . 3 . 3 . 1 Clathrin - associated sorting proteins The AP - 2 centric model of cargo sorting has been expanded in recent years with the observations that distinct cargo with different sorting signals do not compete with each other for entry through CCPs ( Warren et al . , 1998 ) and that short interfering RNA ( siRNA ) depletion of AP - 2 in cell culture only minimally affects internalizaton of some cargo such as LDLR ( Hinrichsen et al . , 2003 ; Motley et al . , 2003 ) . An array of alternate adaptors or clathrin - associated sorting proteins ( CLASPs ) , that increase the sorting repertoire of CCSs beyond AP - 2 - bound cargo , and their recognized sorting signals have been identified ( Traub , 2009 ) . β - arrestin 1 and 2 were the first recognized CLASPs . Following stimulation of G protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) with an appropriate ligand , multiple serine and threonine residues within the cytosolic loops of these receptors are phosphorylated by the G protein - coupled receptor kinase ( GRK ) family members ( Ritter and Hall , 2009 ) . β - arrestins contain an N - terminal bilobed arrestin fold that simultaneously recognizes this three dimensional array of receptor - attached phosphates and receptor loops ( Marchese et al . , 2003 ) and phosphoinositides ( Gaidarov et al . , 1999 ) . This interaction rapidly desensitizes signal propagation by uncoupling heterotrimeric G proteins from the receptor . β - arrestin is usually soluble in the basal state as the largely unstructured C - terminus is bound back on the arrestin fold as an inhibitory clamp . Upon receptor engagement , electrostatic associations with the receptor - attached phosphates discharge the C - terminus revealing AP - 2 appendage and clathrin binding motifs ( Edeling et al . , 2006a ; 14 Burtey et al . , 2007 ) . The revealed clathrin coat interaction motifs target β - arrestin and the associated desensitized receptor to pre - existing clathrin - coated pits for endocytosis and downregulation ( Scott et al . , 2002 ) . In contrast to the YXXØ and [ DE ] XXXL [ LI ] sorting signals constitutively recognized by AP - 2 , β - arrestin recognition of phosphate signals and coupling to the endocytic machinery constitutes a regulated form of endocytosis . As there are roughly 1000 GPCRs encoded in the human genome ( Takeda et al . , 2002 ) making them the largest receptor family , and many but not all utilize β - arrestins and clathrin , this endocytic regulation is critical to homeostasis and adaptation . Table 1 . 1 : Sorting signals for clathrin - mediated endocytosis Sorting Signal / Type Recognition Protein or Domain Example of Cargo YXXØ * AP - 2 µ 2 Transferrin receptor [ DE ] XXXL [ LI ] AP - 2 σ 2 / α CD4 [ FY ] XNPX [ YF ] Dab2 and ARH PTB domain LDL receptor phospho - Ser / Thr β - arrestin 1 and 2 GPCRs Ubiquitin epsin and eps15 UIM EGF receptor * ∅ indicates a bulky hydrophobic residue : Leu , Met , Ile , Phe The CLASPs autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia ( ARH ) and Disabled - 2 ( Dab2 ) recognize sorting signals of the consensus sequence [ FY ] XNPX [ YF ] ( Traub , 2009 ) . Coincidentally , this tyrosine - based sorting signal was discovered by Joseph Goldstein and Michael Brown ( Anderson et al . , 1977 ; Chen et al . , 1990 ) prior to the characterization of AP - 2 or knowledge of alternative adaptors . Mutations in this sequence prevent endocytosis of low density lipoprotein particles by LDLR giving rise to familial hypercholesterolemia . In these proteins , the N - terminal phosphotyrosine binding ( PTB ) domain ( a misnomer because it binds unphosphorylated tyrosine ) simultaneously binds the [ FY ] XNPX [ YF ] signal and the inositol 15 headgroup of the lipid phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) ( Figure 1 . 3 ) , coordinating cargo sorting and membrane localization ( Stolt and Bock , 2006 ) . The ARH and Dab2 C - termini are unstructured and bind to AP - 2 and clathrin , similar to β - arrestin . In mammals , many cell surface molecules destined for CME contain primary sequence encoded sorting signals , however in the yeast S . cerevisiae the primary endocytic signal is appended ubiquitin molecules ( Lauwers et al . , 2010 ) . Three ubiquitin binding proteins , Ent1p , Ent2p , and Ede1p function redundantly in yeast to sort ubiquitinated cargo ( Shih et al . , 2002 ) . The mammalian orthologues epsin 1 , epsin 2 , and epidermal growth factor receptor substrate 15 ( eps15 ) , respectively function in a similar manner ( Wendland , 2002 ; Sorkina et al . , 2006 ) . To target to the plasma membrane , epsin 1 contains an epsin N - terminal homology ( ENTH ) domain and eps15 contains three N - terminal eps15 homology ( EH ) domains that both bind to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Figure 1 . 3 ) ( Traub , 2009 ) . The C - terminal regions of both epsin 1 and eps15 are unstructured . Immediately downstream of the ENTH domain in epsin 1 are three ubiquitin - interacting motifs ( UIM ) while eps15 contains two UIMs at its extreme C - terminus that bind polyubiquitin ( Hawryluk et al . , 2006 ) by conforming to α - helices ( Sims and Cohen , 2009 ) . Epsin contains multiple NPF motifs ( Asp - Pro - Phe ) that allow it to bind the eps15 EH domains , and in fact the name epsin comes from its identification as an eps15 in teracting protein ( Chen et al . , 1998 ) . The remaining regions of unstructured polypeptide contain motifs for binding AP - 2 and clathrin ( epsin 1 ) or solely AP - 2 ( eps15 ) and will be described in detail below . Similar to post - translational phosphorylation for β - arrestins , ubiquitination of cargo following activation such as for the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) promotes regulated endocytosis through epsin / eps15 ( Traub , 2009 ) . A common theme begins to emerge that many , but not all , CLASPs 16 Figure 1 . 3 . Endocytic protein domains for plasma membrane association . Crystal structures of domains of significant tertiary structure of adaptors involved in CME . The AP180 N - terminal homology ( ANTH ) domain from AP180 ( PDB # 1HG5 ) , epsin N - terminal homology ( ENTH ) domain from epsin ( PDB # 1H0A ) , a phosphotyrosine binding ( PTB ) domain from Dab2 ( PDB # 1M7E ) and the open conformation of the AP - 2 core ( PDB # 2XA7 ) are depicted . These domains display affinity for the lipid PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . The plasma membrane is represented by the yellow line and individual PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 molecules are represented by six - member rings with red dots at the 1 , 4 and 5 positions embedded in the plasma membrane . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 coordinates with specific residues in these domains . AP - 2 binds four molecules of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 : two through the µ 2 subunit , one through the β 2 and one through the α subunit . By rotating the structures 90 ° the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 contact sites are more clearly seen ( red spots , bottom ) . The unstructured C - termini of AP180 , epsin and Dab2 are depicted as black lines . The AP - 2 appendages ( PDB # 1E42 and 1QTS ) are shown connected by unstructured hinge domains . Structures were rendered in PyMOL . 17 sort cargo and recognize the plasma membrane through folded N - terminal domains and interact with the endocytic machinery through interaction motifs within unstructured C - terminal regions . 1 . 3 . 3 . 2 Endocytic Accessory factors CCPs are highly regulated protein assemblies both in time and space . As such they contain a multitude of additional structural and enzymatic factors , termed accessory factors , that control assembly . For example , the neuronal specific protein AP180 and its ubiquitously expressed homolog clathrin assembly lymphoid myeloid leukemia protein ( CALM ) may act as CLASPs for soluble NSF attachment protein receptors ( SNAREs ) ( Harel et al . , 2008 ) , they also function to promote AP - 2 and clathrin assembly at the plasma membrane ( Ahle and Ungewickell , 1986 ) . AP180 and CALM accomplish these functions through the typical modular architecture : a PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding AP180 N - terminal homology ( ANTH ) domain ( Figure 1 . 3 ) , structurally related to the epsin ENTH domain , and an unstructured C - terminus with multiple AP - 2 and clathrin binding motifs ( Kalthoff et al . , 2002 ) . Intersectin is a CCP structural protein that does not bind cargo . It appears to scaffold assembly / CLASP proteins such as the epsins and eps15 to later acting scission ( dynamins ) , actin - related ( neural Wiskott - Aldrich Syndrome Protein , N - WASP ) , and lipid phosphatase ( synaptojanin , SHIP2 ) proteins ( Pechstein et al . , 2010b ) . The energetic cost of generating a spherical vesicle from a flat membrane of typical biological composition is a membrane - bending free energy of ~ 250 - 600 k B T and reactions of thermal energy > 100 k B T do not occur spontaneously ( Hurley et al . , 2010 ) . Clathrin polymerization is absolutely required for generating membrane curvature ( Hinrichsen et al . , 2006 ) and could potentially supply some of this energy . Further membrane bending and / or stabilization may come from members of the Bin / Amphiphysin / Rvs167 ( BAR ) domain family ( Suetsugu et al . , 2010 ) . BAR domains are α - helical obligate anti - parallel homodimers that have 18 a crescent shape . Through numerous Lys / Arg residues on the concave domain surface that interact with negative phospholipids and the propensity of these domains to oligomerize , BAR domain proteins influence membrane curvature in various locations throughout the endocytic and biosynthetic pathways . The BAR domain proteins endophilin and amphiphysin bind indirectly ( endophilin ) or directly ( amphiphysin ) to AP - 2 and clathrin ( Slepnev et al . , 2000 ) and both bind directly to dynamin through their C - terminal SH3 domains ( Simpson et al . , 1999 ) . By preferentially binding curved membranes with a circular diameter of ~ 22 nm , endophilin and amphiphysin couple constriction of the neck of deeply invaginated CCPs to dynamin recruitment for scission ( Brett and Traub , 2006 ) . The terminal stages of CCV formation are characterized by vesicle scission , propulsion and uncoating . The dynamin GTPase plays a critical role in liberating the forming vesicle from the plasma membrane . Though the mechanistic details are still being worked out , dynamin self - assembly at the neck of deeply invaginated CCPs and its GTP hydrolysis induce conformational changes that promote membrane scission ( Mettlen et al . , 2009 ) . Actin nucleation may provide tensile force for scission ( Ferguson et al . , 2009 ) and transport for movement of the vesicle away from the membrane ( Galletta et al . , 2010 ) . In 3T3 cells , actin is apparently used at all buds ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . Finally , CCVs must uncoat to allow fusion of the vesicle with endosomes . This is accomplished by targeting the chaperone Hsc70 to clathrin triskelions on the vesicle after budding through an interaction with the co - chaperone auxilin ( neuron specific ) or cyclin G - associated kinase ( GAK , ubiquitous ) , two adaptors that directly engage the clathrin trimerization domain ( Eisenberg and Greene , 2007 ) . ATP hydrolysis by Hsc70 promotes triskelion disengagement and this step in conjunction with dynamin - mediated GTP hydrolysis are the only 19 direct energy inputs into the system . This raises the issue of how a complex assembly process proceeds forward favorably without frequent failure . 1 . 4 NUCLEATION OF CLATHRIN - COATED STRUCTURES The formation of CCPs at the plasma membrane is a constitutive process . The biochemical and biophysical reactions that govern the earliest phase of CCP construction , i . e . the process of going from a naked patch of plasma membrane to a nascent assembly of AP - 2 , clathrin and cargo , is termed nucleation . Despite active research in the CME field for the past four and a half decades , it is only within the last 10 years that a clearer molecular understanding of this dynamic process has begun to take shape . Purified AP - 1 and AP - 2 promote clathrin cage assembly in vitro at physiological pH ( Keen , 1987 ) and early on were expected to precede clathrin deposition on membranes . At the TGN , recruitment of AP - 1 is dictated by the Arf1 GTPase ( Stamnes and Rothman , 1993 ; Traub et al . , 1993 ) working in concert with cargo ( Le Borgne et al . , 1996 ; Salamero et al . , 1996 ) . Nucleation of AP - 1 - positive CCVs is initiated when a guanine nucleotide exchange factor ( GEF ) for Arf1 stimulates GTP binding by Arf1 . The GTP bound active form of Arf1 extends a myristol group to anchor itself to the membrane . Through coincidence detection , AP - 1 recognizes Arf1 - GTP and cargo on the TGN for its correct placement . Coatomer utilizes Arf1 in a mechanistically similar manner to nucleate COPI coats and Sar1 GTPase stimulates COPII coat production . Thus coat nucleation in these instances is directly dependent on an energy input ( GTP ) . 20 To date , no evidence implicates an obligatory GTPase in the nucleation of AP - 2 - positive CCVs at the plasma membrane . Some in vitro experiments have shown that recombinant GTP - loaded Arf6 can increase the recruitment of purified AP - 2 to liposome membranes ( Paleotti et al . , 2005 ) . A second study showed that Arf6 may be important in the specific internalization of the angiotensin receptor through CCPs ( Poupart et al . , 2007 ) . However neither study demonstrated a strict dependence of CCSs distribution on Arf6 , though a regulatory role for this protein is within reason . Recently , it was demonstrated that Arf6 is loaded into CCVs in preparation for its function in recycling from endosomes ( Montagnac et al . , 2011 ) . Therefore unlike other coated - vesicle pathways , CME is not dependent on an Arf GTPase . 1 . 4 . 1 An AP - 2 docking complex and synaptotagmins The earliest models for CCP initiation at the plasma membrane posited that receptor tails promoted AP - 2 recruitment to the membrane with subsequent clathrin assembly ( Pearse and Crowther , 1987 ) . The attractiveness of this model aside from its simplicity is that CCVs would only be generated when cargo was available . This model was further supported by reconstitution experiments in which purified AP - 2 and clathrin were used to generate CCPs on isolated fibroblast ventral membranes . Treatment of AP - 2 / clathrin stripped membranes with elastase prior to addition of purified components abolished AP - 2 binding ( Mahaffey et al . , 1990 ) . Also the elastase - cleaved membrane - derived fragments purified over an AP affinity column were dominated by a 45 kDa fragment that could inhibit AP - 2 binding to membranes ( Peeler et al . , 1993 ) . This gave rise to the idea that there was a specific AP - 2 receptor or “docking complex” responsible for nucleating CCPs that would then be available for cargo concentration ( Kirchhausen et al . , 1997 ) . 21 The process of CME is perhaps most robust in neurons and in particular at presynaptic boutons where it serves the function of compensatory endocytosis for replenishment of synaptic vesicles ( SV ) ( Rizzoli and Jahn , 2007 ) . The hypothesis that a SV protein could act as an AP - 2 docking factor , because many proteins found in SVs are directly retrieved by CCVs without an endosomal intermediate , lead to the finding that Synaptotagmin I ( Syt I ) could bind AP - 2 ( Zhang et al . , 1994 ) . Syts are integral membrane and Ca 2 + binding proteins that act as a molecular trigger for Ca 2 + induced exocytosis ( Pang and Sudhof , 2010 ) . As Syt I is a neuronal protein , this finding could not explain how AP - 2 was recruited in somatic cells . This was followed by a second study by the same group that showed a variety of Syts with wider tissue expression profiles also bound AP - 2 ( Li et al . , 1995 ) . Further research into this model for CCV nucleation showed that tyrosine sorting signal - containing peptides increased AP - 2 binding to Syt I , suggesting cargo enhances recruitment of AP - 2 ( Haucke and De Camilli , 1999 ) . AP - 2 binding of the Syt Ca 2 + - binding C2 domain , C2B , occurs through the µ2 subunit at a region distinct from YXXØ - recognition ( Haucke et al . , 2000 ) , so perhaps the excess peptide biased the AP - 2 core toward the open conformation so that it can recognize Syt . Finally , in a cell culture model , a truncated version of the more ubiquitous Syt VII oligomerizes with endogenous Syt of HeLa cells and inhibits LDL uptake as a dominant negative ( von Poser et al . , 2000 ) . These lines of evidence were interpreted as to label Syt a nucleating protein for CME . However the function of Syt as a dedicated docking protein for AP - 2 has been called into question for the following reasons : 1 . Neurotransmission phenotypes of Syt - null Drosophila have provided contradictory results , either being modest ( DiAntonio et al . , 1993 ) or severe ( Littleton et al . , 1993 ) , whereas AP - 2 α mutant alleles are lethal ( Gonzalez - Gaitan and Jackle , 22 1997 ) , 2 . Proteomics of liver - derived CCVs failed to detect a Syt isoform ( Girard et al . , 2005 ) , and 3 . Research along these lines have not been followed up on in more recent years . For these reasons , Syts may be cargoes for CCPs but are not likely to be the nucleating complex in all budding reactions ; Syts have a well established biochemical role in regulating membrane fusion ( Pang and Sudhof , 2010 ) . 1 . 4 . 2 Phosphatidylinositol lipids and associated lipid kinases How then is AP - 2 selectively deposited at the plasma membrane to promote CCS assembly ? Phosphatidylinositol is a relatively minor lipid present in the cytosolic leaflets of eukaryotic cell membrane , constituting just ~ 15 % of total phospholipids ( Di Paolo and De Camilli , 2006 ) . Reversible phosphorylation of three hydroxyl groups ( C - 3 , C - 4 and C - 5 ) on the 6 - member inositol ring gives rise to seven different phosphatidylinositol phosphate ( PIP ) moieties or phosphoinositides ( Figure 1 . 4A , B ) . A subset of these phosphoinositides has specific cellular distributions on various organelles . Phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) is concentrated almost exclusively at the plasma membrane . Therefore PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 could act as a compartmental cue to regulate AP - 2 and clathrin assembly ( Figure 1 . 4C ) . Purified AP - 2 binds to protein - extracted vesicles and membranes ( Virshup and Bennett , 1988 ) ( though integral membrane receptors are likely present and may have contributed ) , which initially implicated AP - 2 - membrane interactions as important for CCP formation . In fact , clathrin has no affinity for membranes ( Unanue et al . , 1981 ) and so AP - 2 is required to link clathrin to the budding vesicle and the cargo . This is accomplished through four PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - recognizing basic side chain residue patches within the AP - 2 core that coordinate with the lipid phosphate groups : one each upon the α subunit ( Gaidarov and Keen , 1999 ; Collins et al . , 2002 ) 23 Figure 1 . 4 : Phosphoinositide species generation and subcellular distribution . ( A ) The inositol ring of phosphatidylinositol ( PtdIns ) can be reversibly phosphorylated at the C - 3 , C - 4 and C - 5 positions . Phosphatidylinositol - 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) is shown . ( B ) Reversible phosphorylation of PtdIns yields seven different phosphoinositides . These reactions are carried out by many unique and some overlapping lipid kinases ( red ) and phosphatases ( black ) . Only relevant lipid enzymes are labeled for simplicity . ( C ) Subcellular distribution of phosphoinositides . MVB / LE , multivesicular body / late endosome ; TGN , trans - Golgi network . ( B ) and ( C ) are modified from ( Vicinanza et al . , 2008 ) . 24 and β 2 subunit ( Jackson et al . , 2010 ) and two at the distal C - terminus of the µ 2 subunit ( Collins et al . , 2002 ; Rohde et al . , 2002 ; Jackson et al . , 2010 ) . Mutation of these critical residues in the AP - 2 α subunit prevent recruitment of the AP - 2 complex to the plasma membrane in cells ( Gaidarov and Keen , 1999 ) and inhibits Tf endocytosis ( Motley et al . , 2006 ) while the β 2 site is also important for binding to membranes ( Jackson et al . , 2010 ) . The importance of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in CCP assembly extends to nearly all adaptors as their modular domains , including the ENTH ( Itoh et al . , 2001 ) , ANTH ( Ford et al . , 2001 ) , EH ( Naslavsky et al . , 2007 ) and PTB ( Mishra et al . , 2002a ) domains , bind this lipid ( Figure 1 . 3 ) . Cell culture assays have allowed careful perturbation of lipids to assess the effects on CCP nucleation . The earliest demonstration for a direct role of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in nucleation involved the inhibition of TfR sequestration in perforated cells by the addition of the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding pleckstrin homology domain from phospholipase C δ ( Jost et al . , 1998 ) . More recently , an expression system consisting of rapamycin - inducible protein domain heterodimerization leading to membrane recruitment of a phosphatidylinositol 5 - phosphatase , convincingly shows that acute PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 depletion causes a dramatic loss of fluorescently - tagged AP - 2 from the plasma membrane ( Zoncu et al . , 2007 ) and disruption of Tf uptake ( Varnai et al . , 2006 ) . The reproducibility of this experiment has strengthened this model of nucleation ( Abe et al . , 2008 ) . Furthermore , pharmacological inhibition of phospholipase D , an enzyme that produces phosphatidic acid ( PtdOH ) that can stimulate PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - producing lipid kinases , causes reversible loss of endocytic structures on the plasma membrane ( Boucrot et al . , 2006 ) , though the specificity of PtdOH inhibition by this method has been called into question ( Antonescu et al . , 2010 ) . That currently no similar observations of complete loss of AP - 2 25 structures upon Arf6 or Syt depletion have been reported indicates that , currently , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is the most likely candidate for facilitating CCP nucleation . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in mammals is produced by the type I and type II PIP kinases ( PIPKI and PIPKII ) ( Heck et al . , 2007 ) . Though originally thought to both use phosphatidylinositol - 4 - phosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 ) P ) as a substrate , it is now known that PIPKIs utilize PtdIns ( 4 ) P and phosphorylate the C - 5 position while PIPKIIs utilize phosphatidylinositol - 5 - phosphate ( PtdIns ( 5 ) P ) and phosphorylate the C - 4 position to generate the same product . PIPKIs produce the majority of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in cells and this family is further divided into three isoforms : PIPKI α , PIPKI β ( Ishihara et al . , 1996 ; Loijens and Anderson , 1996 ) , and PIPKI γ ( Ishihara et al . , 1998 ) . In addition PIPKI γ is alternatively spliced at its C - terminus producing PIPKI γ 661 ( PIPKI γ a ) , PIPKI γ 635 ( PIPKI γ b ) and PIPKI γ 688 ( PIPKI γ c ) ( mouse terminal residues 661 and 635 , rat terminal residue 688 ) ( Giudici et al . , 2004 ) . Direct modulation of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 generating and consuming enzymes have also highlighted the importance of lipid metabolism in CCP nucleation and regulation of endocytosis . Knockout of PIPKI γ in mice is postnatally lethal by 24 hours . However in isolated neurons from these animals , a defect in compensatory endocytosis and reduction in generation of clathrin - coated bud profiles following depolarization is observed ( Di Paolo et al . , 2004 ) . The pups appeared anatomically normal after birth and are thought to have died from synaptic defects , underscoring the importance of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 for CME in neurotransmission . In Drosophila , hypomorphic alleles of the type I PIPK Skittles greatly reduces yolk protein endocytosis in oocytes ( Compagnon et al . , 2009 ) . By contrast , knockout of synaptojanin 1 in mice , a polyphosphoinositide phosphatase , results in the accumulation of clathrin - coated vesicle profiles ( ~ 6x greater than wildtype ) in nerve terminals of neurons in culture ( Cremona et al . , 1999 ) . 26 These results and others have given rise to a phosphoinositide phosphorylation - dephosphorylation cycle model in which a wave of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 production promotes CME and its hydrolysis promotes uncoating ( Cremona and De Camilli , 2001 ) . This model gained support recently when live - cell imaging studies of fluorescent PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding domains expressed at low - levels in yeast , where CME shares many mechanistic parallels with vertebrate CME , indicated that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels rise and fall during endocytic actin patch progression ( Sun et al . , 2007a ) . An important question for the regulation of CCP nucleation and turnover is whether the steady - state levels of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at the plasma membrane are sufficient for CCP generation or whether local generation of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is needed in addition ? Three lines of evidence suggest that direct binding of PIPKIs to the endocytic machinery could prime nascent assembly zones for PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 production and drive the budding reaction forward . In one , a putative YXXØ sorting signal ( YSPL ) in the C - terminus of PIPKI γ engages the AP - 2 µ 2 subunit via the YXXØ recognition region ( Bairstow et al . , 2006 ) . Forced expression of PIPKI γ in MDCK cells increased Tf endocytosis without detectably altering global PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels , while PIPKI γ knockdown in HeLa cells reduced Tf uptake . Similarly , another group found that the AP - 2 µ 2 subunit can bind the core of PIPKI α , β or γ but at a region distinct from the YXXØ sorting signal recognition domain ( Krauss et al . , 2006 ) . Simultaneous binding of YXXØ sorting signal - containing cargo stimulates PIPKI enzymatic activity . In a completely different study , the C - terminus of PIPKI γ was found to interact with the AP - 2 β 2 subunit appendage domain ( Nakano - Kobayashi et al . , 2007 ) . In neurons , depolarization results in dephosphorylation of the PIPKI γ C - terminus , allowing its interaction with AP - 2 and in turn stimulates kinase activity . At least for 27 CME in the brain , where PIPKI γ is highly concentrated , one or a combination of these modes of interaction may be important for rapidly nucleating CCPs . These summarized findings on PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 can be combined with a role for cargo in synthesizing a general mechanism of CCP nucleation . The presence of cargo , and the cytosolic sorting signals contained within , by itself does not drive recruitment of AP - 2 to membranes to nucleate CCPs as determined by overexpression studies ( Santini et al . , 1998 ; Loerke et al . , 2009 ) . In fact there is a cooperativity between PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding by the α / β 2 / µ 2 subunits and sorting signal recognition by the AP - 2 core ( Höning et al . , 2005 ) . Structural studies reveal that the AP - 2 core is likely in a ‘closed’ conformation in the cytosol and a conformational change stabilized by PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 binding to α / β 2 / µ 2 allows cargo access to the sorting subunits ( Collins et al . , 2002 ; Jackson et al . , 2010 ) . This conformational change is catalyzed by µ 2 Thr156 phosphorylation by adaptor - associated kinase 1 ( AAK1 ) ( Ricotta et al . , 2002 ) biasing the µ 2 subunit to extend and expose the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and YXXØ - binding regions ( Jackson et al . , 2010 ) . Therefore cargo likely stabilizes nucleating clathrin structures and is incorporated into budding vesicles during assembly ( Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ; Loerke et al . , 2009 ) . Coincidence detection of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and cargo restrict AP - 2 deposition to the plasma membrane . 1 . 4 . 3 The EFC domain proteins FCHO1 and FCHO2 The BAR domain proteins are intimately tied to membrane curvature generation / sensing throughout the endocytic and biosynthetic pathways ( Suetsugu et al . , 2010 ) . BAR domains themselves are obligate anti - parallel homodimers that form a crescent shape . The N - BAR subfamily consists of members such as amphiphysin with an N - terminal BAR domain containing 28 an amphipathic helix that may insert into the membrane during protein assembly . The extended FER / CIP4 homology ( EFC ) domain ( also known as F - BAR ) subfamily has sequence similarity to N - BAR proteins as well as overall conservation of tertiary structure ( Roberts - Galbraith and Gould , 2010 ) . The majority of EFC domain proteins have the EFC domain at the N - terminus and one or more SH3 domains at the C - terminus , similar to N - BAR proteins . The main difference between EFC and N - BAR proteins is that EFC domain proteins typically have a larger radius of curvature associated with the crescent - shaped EFC domain and some EFC domain proteins form end - to - end oligomers , a property not yet demonstrated for N - BAR proteins ( Roberts - Galbraith and Gould , 2010 ) . A recently discovered subfamily within the EFC domain proteins is the muniscin proteins ( mu homology domain and menisc In mammals , FCHO1 and FCHO2 have been proposed to act as nucleators of CCPs ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) . FCHO1 / 2 like Syp1p bind to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - enriched membranes and can us shaped ) that include FCHO1 , FCHO2 and Syp1p ( Reider et al . , 2009 ) . The Fes / CIP4 homology only ( FCHO ) proteins were discovered as lacking a C - terminal SH3 domain unlike other EFC domain proteins but now , in addition to the S . cerevisiae protein Syp1p , are known to have a C - terminal µ homology domain ( µ HD ) . The µ HD has sequence and structural homology to the cargo sorting AP - 2 µ 2 subunit ( Reider et al . , 2009 ) . This property makes the muniscins a unique group of proteins within the EFC subfamily whose cellular functions are largely unknown . In yeast , Syp1p ( FCHO homolog ) and Ede1p ( eps15 homolog ) are early arriving proteins at cortical actin patches ( endocytic sites in yeast ) where they regulate patch turnover and polarized endocytic placement at the bud neck ( Stimpson et al . , 2009 ) . Syp1 binds Ede1p through its µ HD and may also act as a cargo - specific adaptor for the endocytosis of the yeast transmembrane protein Mid2p ( Reider et al . , 2009 ) . 29 promote tubulation in vitro ( Reider et al . , 2009 ; Henne et al . , 2010 ) . FCHO1 / 2 and eps15 are early components of mammalian CCPs , preceding clathrin and other endocytic proteins . This is a property that would be expected for a nucleating factor . Most striking is that the levels of FCHO proteins are reported to control the rate of AP - 2 appearance / disappearance at the plasma membrane : FCHO1 + 2 knockdown completely eliminates fluorescently labeled AP - 2 appearance at spots on the membrane while overexpression of FCHO2 increased the number and fluctuations of AP - 2 spots ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) . This property of FCHO1 / 2 is attributed to the binding of the adaptors eps15 and intersectin to the µ HD which could then bind AP - 2 for tethering and recruiting it to the plasma membrane . Early recruitment of FCHO1 / 2 could then begin an assembly chain to construct CCPs . In this model , nucleation and assembly are therefore tied to initiation of membrane curvature . These findings and conjectures remain to be independently validated . 1 . 5 PROGRESSION OF CLATHRIN - COATED STRUCTURES 1 . 5 . 1 Clathrin - assembly interaction motifs Following the nucleation phase , or the placement of a few molecules of AP - 2 and clathrin on the plasma membrane , a growth or assembly phase must occur as the nascent bud grows to the appropriate size to incorporate cargo and promote membrane invagination . CCPs are complex protein assemblies built from a large number of protein - protein interactions ( see web diagram in ( Traub , 2011 ) ) . On the order of 30 proteins are implicated in or are present at some time in 30 Figure 1 . 5 : General architecture of endocytic adaptors and accessory factors . The modular structure of many endocytic proteins comprised of one or more folded domains ( colored boxes ) and regions for which secondary structure cannot be predicted ( zigzags , Jpred2 ) containing motifs for AP - 2 and / or clathrin .

Figure modified from ( Mishra et al . , 2004 ) . 31 assembling clathrin lattices . Work over the past two decades has attempted to characterize the molecular details of these interactions and how they are organized in space and time ( Traub , 2005 ; Schmid and McMahon , 2007 ; Reider and Wendland , 2011 ) . A common theme has emerged that unstructured primary sequence motifs in adaptors , accessory factors and regulatory enzymes bind to folded hub domains in AP - 2 and clathrin ( Figure 1 . 5 ) . As introduced earlier , the core of AP - 2 is primarily responsible for binding to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - enriched membranes via the α and β 2 ( Jackson et al . , 2010 ) and µ 2 ( Rohde et al . , 2002 ) subunits and to YXXØ and [ DE ] XXXL [ LI ] sorting signals through the µ 2 and σ 2 / α , respectively . The α and β 2 appendage domains in contrast act as hubs and coordinate interactions with a majority of proteins involved in CME ( Traub et al . , 1999 ; Owen et al . , 2000 ) . Typically hydrophobic residue side chains with specific spacing between residues in the unstructured region of the appendage binding partner bury themselves in the binding pocket of Table 1 . 2 : Clathrin assembly interaction motifs Consensus Sequence Example Proteins Binding Site DP [ FW ] eps15 , epsin , Dab2 AP - 2 α appendage platform FXDXF amphiphysin , AP180 AP - 2 α appendage platform WXX [ FW ] X [ DE ] Synaptojanin 1 , AAK1 , NECAP AP - 2 α appendage sandwich [ DE ] n X 1 - 2 FXX [ FL ] XXXR β - arrestin 1 / 2 , ARH , epsin 1 AP - 2 β 2 appendage platform F rich eps15 , AP180 , amphiphysin AP - 2 β 2 appendage sandwich L ∅ [ DEN ] ∅ [ DEN ] AP - 2 , epsin , Dab2 , ARH , β - arrestin clathrin HC terminal domain PWXXW amphiphysin clathrin HC terminal domain NPF epsin 1 , Dab2 eps15 EH domain * X denotes any amino acid ; ∅ indicates a bulky hydrophobic residue : Leu , Met , Ile , Phe 32 either the α or β 2 appendage platform ( C - terminal ) subdomain or sandwich ( N - terminal ) subdomain ( Table 1 . 2 ) . The interaction of a single motif is relatively weak , k D 10 - 100 mM , however low affinity is often compensated for by high avidity with the presence of multiple motifs ( Edeling et al . , 2006b ) . The α appendage binding sites were fully characterized first by structural and biochemical studies and accommodate three different interaction motifs . The α appendage platform binds DP [ FW ] and FXDXF motifs in partially overlapping sites ( Benmerah et al . , 1996 ; Owen et al . , 1999 ; Brett et al . , 2002 ) . These motifs are present in a large number of endocytic proteins including eps15 , epsin , Dab2 , synaptojanin and AP180 ( Mishra et al . , 2004 ) . The binding site upon the α appendage sandwich subdomain binds the motif of consensus WXX [ FW ] X [ DE ] ( Mishra et al . , 2004 ; Praefcke et al . , 2004 ; Ritter et al . , 2004 ; Walther et al . , 2004 ) . The presence of this motif is more restricted than DP [ FW ] and FXDXF and is found in proteins such as synaptojanin 1 , AAK1 and GAK . Also , proteins that have both platform and sandwich binding motifs such as synaptojanin 1 can engage both simultaneously ( Mishra et al . , 2004 ) . The presence of multiple and varied motifs likely allows these proteins to cross - link AP - 2 molecules and stabilize the assembly . While the α appendage binds endocytic motifs in extended , unstructured conformations , the AP - 2 β 2 appendage platform subdomain induces unstructured motifs to adopt an α - helical secondary structure ( Mishra et al . , 2005 ; Edeling et al . , 2006a ; Schmid et al . , 2006 ) . Sequences of the consensus [ DE ] n X 1 - 2 FXX [ FL ] XXXR in the CLASPs ARH , β - arrestin and epsin facilitate binding to this domain ( Edeling et al . , 2006a ; Schmid et al . , 2006 ) . The key anchoring Phe and Arg residues are spaced as to align on one side of the induced α - helix . The β 2 appendage also harbors a sandwich site for binding endocytic proteins . Though not as fully characterized as 33 other sites , it appears that Phe side chains of a sequence in eps15 , AP180 and amphiphysin are important for burrowing in this binding pocket during engagement ( Edeling et al . , 2006a ; Schmid et al . , 2006 ) . The clathrin heavy chain terminal domain is also a hub during assembly . The terminal domain is a seven - bladed β - propellar fold that projects down into the adaptor layer of CCPs and CCVs . Many adaptors including AP - 2 , epsin , Dab2 , ARH and β - arrestins contain a clathrin box motif of the consensus LØ [ DEN ] Ø [ DEN ] that binds in a linear conformation between blades 1 and 2 of the terminal domain ( ter Haar et al . , 2000 ; Traub , 2005 ) . Often a clathrin box motif will accompany one or more AP - 2 interaction motifs . A less common W box motif ( PWXXW ) found in amphiphysins may also contribute to assembly and binds to the center of the terminal domain ( Miele et al . , 2004 ) . Clathrin and W box motifs allow adaptors and AP - 2 to capture soluble Figure 1 . 6 : Molecular assembly of clathrin - coated structures . This figure illustrates the initial placement of adaptors and clathrin on the plasma membrane prior to membrane invagination . AP - 2 molecules are transiently recruited by binding PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 through the α subunit ( far left ) and are stabilized by µ 2 rearrangement ( far right ) . This promotes receptor binding ( center ) . Clustering of AP - 2 and CLASPs promotes clathrin binding through AP - 2 appendages and clathrin box motifs in the AP - 2 hinge ( yellow ellipse ) and monomeric adaptors . FCHO1 / 2 and eps15 and intersectin are not depicted . Sorting signals or tags within cargo molecules are labeled below the figure , as are the adaptors that recognize these signals . Adaptors and cargo are color - coded . This flat clathrin assembly will proceed to a spherical coat such as that seen in Figure 1 . 1 . 34 clathrin triskelions and promote their polymerization . Clearly the multiplicity of binding partners and four spatially separate interaction surfaces of the AP - 2 appendages permit many binding possibilities . How these are managed during assembly is not clear but seems crucial to the successful budding of a CCV . 1 . 5 . 2 Chronology of assembly Combining the information from adaptor - AP - 2 - clathrin binding and recent data from time - resolved imaging of transiently expressed accessory factor lifetimes at productive CCPs ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) , we can begin to construct a clearer picture of how CCPs assemble . An ‘early adaptor module’ ( based on peak time and recruitment profile ) consists of FCHO1 , FCHO2 , eps15 and AP - 2 and peaks early ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . Binding of FCHO1 / 2 to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 may allow the simultaneous binding of eps15 and intersectin to the FCHO µ HD and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 or vise versa ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) . A nascent bud site so constructed may then be set for the recruitment of AP - 2 ( which appears after FCHO and eps15 ) , through binding to a DPF array ( Mishra et al . , 2004 ) and Phe rich β 2 appendage sandwich binding site ( Schmid et al . , 2006 ) at the eps15 C - terminus and / or α / β 2 sandwich binding motifs in intersectin ( Pechstein et al . , 2010a ) . Co - recognition of AP - 2 appendage interaction motifs and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - enriched membranes through the α / β 2 subunits would transiently dock ‘closed’ AP - 2 molecules . AAK1 recruited by the AP - 2 α appendage then would mediate phosphorylation of Thr156 on AP - 2 µ 2 ( Ricotta et al . , 2002 ) and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and cargo sorting would stabilize the open AP - 2 35 conformation . AAK1 activity is increased by assembled clathrin , ensuring sorting competent AP - 2 in CCSs while simultaneously regulating AAK1 kinase activity ( Conner et al . , 2003 ) . A ‘later adaptor module’ that slowly builds and peaks at the time of vesicle scission but may start appearing during the ‘early adaptor module’ is composed of epsin , CALM ( the ubiquitous AP180 homolog ) , and clathrin ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . Epsin , by virtue of its PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding ENTH domain , C - terminal DPW motifs , and NPF motifs that bind the eps15 EH domain ( de Beer et al . , 2000 ) would be recruited . AP180 / CALM would bind PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 through the ANTH domain , AP - 2 α and β 2 appendages through an array of motifs ( Ford et al . , 2001 ) and eps15 through NPF motifs . This point of assembly would be critical for clathrin recruitment and polymerization . Epsin , AP180 / CALM and AP - 2 contain clathrin box motifs ( Morris et al . , 1993 ; Shih et al . , 1995 ; Drake et al . , 2000 ) . It has been proposed that the unstructured C - termini of the monomeric adaptors / accessory factors could extend with a radius of 150 - 180 Å into the cytosol and create a clathrin ‘capture zone’ through the exposed clathrin box motifs ( Ungewickell and Hinrichsen , 2007 ; Zhuo et al . , 2011 ) . Membrane bound AP - 2 molecules could potentially extend the appendage domains up to 60 Å to capture and stabilize clathrin triskelions closer to the membrane where they would begin to polymerize . AP - 2 strongly binds clathrin in an anti - parallel bivalent manner through a clathrin box squence contained in the β 2 hinge ( Shih et al . , 1995 ) and a second binding region on the β 2 appendage that recognizes the clathrin distal leg ( Edeling et al . , 2006a ; Schmid et al . , 2006 ) . At this point the assembly may resemble the schematic shown in Figure 1 . 6 . Bud invagination requires clathrin polymerization ( Hinrichsen et al . , 2006 ) but alone may be insufficient and require other factors . An amphipathic helix inserted into the membrane by the epsin ENTH domain may contribute by expanding the cytosolic membrane leaflet relative to the 36 extracellular leaflet ( Ford et al . , 2002 ) , although this remains to be shown in vivo . The N - BAR and EFC domain proteins likely contribute as well . Syndapin2 , an EFC protein , is recruited and exits during the assembly phase and may stabilize or induce curvature along FCHO1 / 2 and clathrin ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . The N - BAR protein module of endophilin 2 , amphiphysin 1 , and BIN1 sharply peak and regress just prior to scission suggesting they function at the highly curved CCP neck where they can recruit dynamin through their SH3 domains . In accordance with this , dynamin 1 and 2 peak almost precisely at the moment of scission ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . Amphiphysin in particular is at least partially recruited through interaction with the AP - 2 α and β 2 appendages and clathrin terminal domains ( Miele et al . , 2004 ; Edeling et al . , 2006a ) . 1 . 5 . 3 Accessory factor displacement and directionality of assembly A currently unresolved and global question in the field is , given the number of components and complexity of their interactions , what ensures the forward progression of CCP assembly ? Clearly the residency of an endocytic protein at an assembling bud is determined by the number of contacts it makes with the coat proteins , the affinity and avidity of these interactions , and availability of binding sites over time . If phases of assembly are determined by the protein content in CCPs at that time , directionality could be imparted by the addition of new protein components or removal of others . Biochemical experiments have confirmed that some accessory factors can be displaced from AP - 2 during clathrin assembly . Initial structural and functional characterization of the AP - 2 β 2 appendage revealed that while the α appendage has no affinity for clathrin , the β 2 appendage can bind clathrin weakly ( Owen et al . , 2000 ) . When supplied with the β 2 appendage and the 37 adjacent hinge domain , which contains a clathrin box motif , clathrin bound more robustly and the binding of adaptors / accessory factors including AP180 , eps15 and epsin was compromised . Site - directed mutagenesis of potential binding surfaces concentrated on the platform domain as that was the only site known on the α appendage at the time . Mutation of a few residues including Tyr888 , Arg879 and Trp841 on the platform of the isolated β 2 appendage alone reduced or eliminated binding of clathrin as well as the adaptors / accessory factors with the exception of eps15 and suggested that adaptor and clathrin binding to the platform site was mutually exclusive ( Owen et al . , 2000 ) . These findings were confirmed in a later study by the same group that showed that with increased binding of clathrin to the β 2 appendage and hinge , AP180 and amphiphysin binding decreased relative to binding to the appendage alone ( Schmid et al . , 2006 ) . However this study was fraught with inconsistencies to the first . Binding of eps15 and epsin to the β 2 appendage and hinge were unaffected by the presence of clathrin . Furthermore , mutation of the β 2 platform residue Tyr888 that eliminated binding of accessory factors and clathrin in pull down assays previously ( Owen et al . , 2000 ) , had only a minor effect on the accessory factors ( Schmid et al . , 2006 ) . In contrast to these studies , two lines of evidence suggest that the distal leg of clathrin binds not to the β 2 appendage platform but to the sandwich site . In pull down experiments with the β 2 appendage and hinge domain , mutation of the β 2 sandwich site ( tyrosine - 815 ) and the terminal domain - binding clathrin box within the hinge had a synergistic effect in the reduction of clathrin binding ( Edeling et al . , 2006a ) . This site is bound by eps15 , AP180 and amphiphysin . Secondly , computational modeling suggests the clathrin leg ankle domain binds to the Golgi - localized gamma - adaptin ear homology protein ( GGA ) , an adaptor for CCV formation at the Golgi , at a site that has structural homology to the AP - 2 β 2 appendage sandwich subdomain 38 ( Knuehl et al . , 2006 ) . GGAs do not have a platform subdomain . Though the precise details are in conflict , the idea that clathrin binds to AP - 2 in an anti - parallel manner by the clathrin terminal domain binding a clathrin box motif in the hinge and the clathrin ankle domain binding to the appendage is supported . Competition of proteins from AP - 2 could remove them from the bud site unless the proteins make additional contacts such as with clathrin itself . A variation on this idea is the “changing hubs” model ( Schmid et al . , 2006 ; Schmid and McMahon , 2007 ) . In this model , the early assembly phase is governed by the AP - 2 appendage hubs . The numerous appendage binding partners are recruited and assist in recruiting and assembling clathrin . As clathrin polymerizes into the lattice around AP - 2 and occupies the β 2 appendage ( in this model the platform site ) , the displaced binding partners are retained within the assembling CCP through a switch in binding to the clathrin terminal domain hub . It is proposed that this change in binding site importance can drive the process forward although the precise mechanistic details are unknown . 1 . 6 GOALS OF THIS DISSERTATION Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is a complex cellular phenomenon that utilizes ~ 20 - 30 proteins to build a scaffold that efficiently selects cargo from other resident surface proteins while simultaneously invaginating the plasma membrane . Work over the past few decades has identified many of these participating components and uncovered how they interact with the coat , however a clear understanding of the initial nucleation phase of clathrin - coated pit assembly is lacking . My dissertation research seeks to define how early regulatory proteins interface with the endocytic machinery and test the function of newly identified nucleator 39 proteins in vivo . In Chapter 2 , I show that the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - generating enzyme PIPKI γ , present at nerve terminals , prefers to bind to AP - 2 via the β 2 appendage . I also show that it specifically binds to the β 2 appendage sandwich subdomain in an interaction that is mutually exclusive with clathrin . Because PIPKI γ associates with the sandwich subdomain and my model is that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 production could be finely controlled by evicting the PIPKI γ when clathrin assembly overwhelms the β 2 hub , clathrin would need to engage the sandwich site to regulate protein dynamics . Therefore , in Chapter 3 I test the “changing hubs” model of clathrin - coated pit assembly and show that in vivo the β 2 appendage platform partner β - arrestin 1 is not displaced by clathrin during endocytosis . In Chapter 4 I test the function of the recently discovered endocytic proteins FCHO1 and FCHO2 in clathrin - mediated endocytosis in vivo . While FCHO1 / 2 have been proposed to act as obligate nucleators of clathrin - coated pits , I show that they are not absolutely required for endocytic site placement in cells or for cargo internalization . Instead they appear to regulate clathrin - coated structure size and number . This thesis helps to clarify mechanistic models on how the site of clathrin assembly is initially selected and formed . 40 2 . 0 CLATHRIN REGULATES THE ASSOCIATION OF PIPKI γ 661 WITH THE AP - 2 ADAPTOR β 2 APPENDAGE * * Reprinted from Journal of Biological Chemistry , ( 2009 , volume 284 , issue 20 , pp . 13924 - 13939 ) , with permission from The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology 2 . 1 ABSTRACT The AP - 2 clathrin adaptor differs fundamentally from the related AP - 1 , AP - 3 and AP - 4 sorting complexes because membrane deposition does not depend directly on an Arf - family GTPase . Instead , phosphatidylinositiol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) appears to act as the principal compartmental cue for AP - 2 placement at the plasma membrane , as well as for the docking of numerous other important clathrin - coat components at the nascent bud site . This PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 dependence makes type I phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate 5 - kinases ( PIPKI ) lynchpin enzymes in the assembly of clathrin - coated structures at the cell surface . PIPKI γ is the chief 5 - kinase at nerve terminals and here we show that the 26 amino acid , alternatively - spliced C - terminus of PIPKI γ 661 is an intrinsically unstructured polypeptide that binds directly to the sandwich subdomain of the AP - 2 β 2 subunit appendage . An aromatic side chain - based , extended interaction motif that also includes the two bulky C - terminal residues of the short PIPKI γ 635 41 variant is necessary for β 2 appendage engagement . The clathrin heavy chain accesses the same contact surface on the AP - 2 β 2 appendage but , because of additional clathrin binding sites located within the unstructured hinge segment of the β 2 subunit , clathrin binds the β 2 chain with a higher apparent affinity than PIPKI γ 661 . A clathrin - regulated interaction with AP - 2 could allow PIPKI γ 661 to be strategically positioned for regional PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 generation during clathrin - coated vesicle assembly at the synapse . 2 . 2 INTRODUCTION The key regulatory activity of phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) during clathrin - mediated endocytosis is firmly established ( Di Paolo and De Camilli , 2006 ; Krauss and Haucke , 2007 ) . The heterotetrameric AP - 2 adaptor complex and numerous clathrin - associated sorting proteins ( CLASPs ) display dedicated surfaces or domains that engage PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 with good selectively ( Maldonado - Baez and Wendland , 2006 ; Schmid and McMahon , 2007 ; Ungewickell and Hinrichsen , 2007 ) . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , which is localized to the cell surface , thus biases the deposition and assembly of these coat components at the plasma membrane by synergizing with other low affinity interactions in a phenomenon termed coincidence detection ( Di Paolo and De Camilli , 2006 ; Schmid and McMahon , 2007 ) . Later acting endocytic regulatory proteins also bind to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . The large GTPase dynamin contains a pleckstrin homology ( PH ) domain , which engages PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and is required for vesicle scission ( Vallis et al . , 1999 ) . Similarly , the clathrin uncoating cofactor , auxilin , has a PTEN - homology domain that also binds to phosphoinositides and is necessary for targeting of this J - domain protein to clathrin - coated membranes ( Lee et al . , 2006 ) . The lipid binding features of all these endocytic 42 components is in full accord with PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 being necessary for both early and late stages of coated vesicle production ( Jost et al . , 1998 ) . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is a general , apparently ubiquitous marker of the plasma membrane and the concept of functionally autonomous , stable PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - enriched microdomains within the cytosolic leaflet of the membrane has been challenged ( Brough et al . , 2005 ; van Rheenen et al . , 2005 ; Yaradanakul and Hilgemann , 2007 ) . This raises the question of whether the prevailing PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 concentration at the cell surface is simply permissive and sufficient for nucleation and sustained clathrin - coated vesicle assembly and budding , or whether , in addition to basal PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 that might act as an initial compartmental cue , regional synthesis of this lipid is also necessary for clathrin - coat assembly and progression . Supporting the first possibility is the general decrease in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels in the brains of phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase type I γ ( PIPKI γ ) nullizygous mice that parallels major synaptic vesicle recycling aberrations in neurons of these animals , which die before ( Narkis et al . , 2007 ; Wang et al . , 2007 ) or shortly after ( Di Paolo et al . , 2004 ) birth . Also , activated P2Y purinergic receptors , which trigger phospholipase C - mediated cleavage of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , diminish clathrin - mediated uptake of insulin ( Carvou et al . , 2006 ) , suggesting that signaling and endocytic processes can utilize a common phosphoinositide pool . PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is rather uniformly dispersed over the plasma membrane of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae ( Stefan et al . , 2002 ; Yu et al . , 2004 ) and Mss4p , the only phosphatidylinositol 4 - phosphate 5 - kinase in this organism , is not localized to cortical , clathrin - containing endocytic structures ( Sun et al . , 2007a ) . In mammalian cells , the subcellular positioning of PIPKI enzymes is , at least in part , dictated by substrate availability / concentration as switching the activation loop residues of a type II PIPK , which usually acts on PtdIns5P , to that of a PIPKI , induces the chimeric kinase to localize to the cell 43 surface ( Kunz et al . , 2000 ) . In addition , ectopically expressed , tailored proteins that drive rapamycin - induced consumption of bulk PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 lead to a rapid and dramatic loss of the majority of surface - associated clathrin - coated structures and halt clathrin - dependent internalization ( Varnai et al . , 2006 ; Zoncu et al . , 2007 ; Abe et al . , 2008 ) . In fact , excess PH domain can block clathrin - mediated endocytosis in an in vitro reconstitution assay ( Jost et al . , 1998 ) . Yet the second idea of localized PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis is in accord with the subcellular localization of PIPKI isozymes depending upon more than just the location of PtdIns4P ( Brough et al . , 2005 ) , and with the PIPKI enzymes associating physically with the AP - 2 adaptor complex ( Bairstow et al . , 2006 ; Krauss et al . , 2006 ; Nakano - Kobayashi et al . , 2007 ) and with β - arrestin ( Nelson et al . , 2008 ) . That the interaction with AP - 2 stimulates catalysis ( Krauss et al . , 2006 ; Nakano - Kobayashi et al . , 2007 ) lends additional support for a feed - forward model for staged PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 generation at nascent clathrin assembly zones at the cell surface . The fact that ectopic expression of PIPKI enzymes in cultured cells increases both the number of surface clathrin - coated structures and the rate of internalization ( Padron et al . , 2003 ) also indicates that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 on the cell surface can be limiting . Local production of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 might counteract general competition of endocytic factors with other cell surface proteins for a limited phosphoinositide pool , and thus may be important to sustain the rapid kinetics of clathrin - mediated endocytosis . This may be particularly relevant in vivo during signal transmission when PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is consumed to generate diacylglycerol ( DAG ) , Ins ( 1 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 or PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( Carvou et al . , 2006 ; Di Paolo and De Camilli , 2006 ; Krauss and Haucke , 2007 ) . Irrespective of precisely how PIPKI enzymes translocate to the plasma membrane , what is also clear is that temporal remodeling of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 apparently accompanies coated vesicle 44 biogenesis ( Perera et al . , 2006 ; Sun et al . , 2007a ) . After targeted gene disruption of the phosphoinositide polyphosphatase synaptojanin 1 , neurons exhibit excessive and prolonged clathrin coat associations with the membrane ( Cremona et al . , 1999 ; Harris et al . , 2000 ) . Somewhat analogously , S . cerevisiae synaptojanin null mutants display mislocalized PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , the phospholipid now appearing in endosomal structures ( Stefan et al . , 2002 ; Sun et al . , 2007a ) . These results show clearly that under normal conditions , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 within forming transport vesicles is dephosphorylated prior to , or rapidly following , scission from the cell surface . Recent time - resolved live - cell imaging of the two splice isoforms of synaptojanin 1 , termed SJ145 and SJ170 ( Ramjaun and McPherson , 1996 ) , reveals that while SJ145 masses at the bud site around the time of the fission event , SJ170 populates the coat throughout the assembly process ( Perera et al . , 2006 ) . Thus molecular mechanisms appear to exist to align cycles of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 formation and hydrolysis with progression of the coated assemblage toward the final fission step . In this study , we confirm that PIPKI γ , a vital lipid kinase ( Di Paolo et al . , 2004 ; Narkis et al . , 2007 ; Wang et al . , 2007 ) and the major PtdIns4P kinase at the synapse ( Wenk et al . , 2001 ) , binds to AP - 2 chiefly through the functionally autonomous appendage domain of the large β 2 chain . We show that this depends on an interaction surface positioned upon the sandwich subdomain of the β 2 appendage , a site also engaged by clathrin and eps15 . Binding of these proteins to the β 2 appendage is mutually exclusive , leading to a model for spatial and temporal phosphoinositide remodeling managed by AP - 2 appendages . 45 2 . 3 RESULTS 2 . 3 . 1 PIPKI γ 661 membrane translocation and AP - 2 recruitment Synaptic plasma membranes ( Figure 2 . 1A ) , purified from rat brain synaptosome preparations ( Figure 2 . 1B ) by hypotonic lysis , contain trace levels of all three PIPKI isoforms , α , β and γ ( Figure 2 . 1C ) . After extracting the membranes with 1 M KCl , predominantly the ~ 90 - kDa PIPKI γ isoforms and PIPKI α are removed , but the treatment has no effect on the membrane - associated proteins Syt 1 and SNAP - 25 ( Figure 2 . 1C ) . Cell - free kinase assays show that the salt - washing procedure diminishes the temperature - dependent synthesis of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to ~ 67 % ( n = 3 ; Figure 2 . 1D , compare lane b and d ) , presumably due to the removal of PIPKI . By contrast , PtdIns4P synthesis changes < 10 % on the extracted membranes . Using the salt - washed synaptic plasma membranes as a template for in vitro clathrin - coat assembly assays , we find that the translocation of cytosolic clathrin , the AP - 2 adaptor complex and AP180 correlates with the accumulation of PIPKI γ 661on the synaptic membranes ( Figure 2 . 1E , lane c ) , and an increase in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis ( Figure 2 . 1D , compare lane d and f ) . The recruitment of PIPKI γ 661 under these conditions suggests there may be linkage between PIPKI γ and AP - 2 / clathrin membrane translocation . In fact , there is evidence for PIPKI enzymes associating directly with AP - 2 in three molecularly distinct manners . The long - splice isoform of PIPKI γ contains a C - terminal 644 YSPL sequence that can interact with the cargo - selective µ 2 subunit of AP - 2 , akin to YXXØ - type receptor sorting signals ( Bairstow et al . , 2006 ) . The same general region of the 26 amino - acid C - terminal insert of PIPKI γ 661 can bind to the independently folded 46 Figure 2 . 1 : PIPKI γ 661 and AP - 2 are coordinately recruited to the synaptic plasma membrane . ( A ) and ( B ) , aliquots of synaptic plasma membrane ( A ) or synaptosomes from which they were derived ( B ) were fixed with 2 % glutaraldehyde and processed for EM . Thin section micrographs typical of the many fields examined are shown . ( C ) Samples of 50 µ g synaptic plasma membrane ( SPM ) were suspended in assay buffer alone or supplemented with 1 M KCl were sedimented after incubation on ice for 30 min . Aliquots of each resuspended membrane pellet were prepared for SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting . Portions of the blots were probed with an affinity - purified polyclonal anti - PIPKI antibody or mAbs directed against Syt 1 or SNAP - 25 . ( D ) Reactions containing 0 . 5 mg / ml untreated or salt - washed synaptic plasma membranes , 5 mg / ml cytosol and 500 µ M [ γ - 32 P ] ATP were prepared as indicated . After incubation at 37°C for 10 min the lipids were extracted and analyzed by TLC and autoradiography . A representative experiment of 3 is shown and the migration positions of authentic phospholipid standards are indicated . ( E ) reactions containing 50 µ g / ml salt - washed synaptic plasma membranes , 5 mg / ml rat brain cytosol and an ATP regenerations system were prepared as indicated . After incubation at 37°C for 15 min , membranes were sedimented and prepared for SDS - PAGE and immunoblotting . Portions of the blots were probed with anti - clathrin - subunit heavy chain ( HC ) mAb TD . 1 , rabbit R11 - 29 anti - µ 2 serum , or an anti - AP180 , anti - PIPKI γ or anti - SNAP - 25 mAb , and only relevant portions of the blots are shown . 47 β 2 appendage of AP - 2 ( Nakano - Kobayashi et al . , 2007 ) . In addition , the central kinase domain of all three PIPKI isoforms is proposed to associate with the µ 2 subunit of AP - 2 , but in a manner that does not overlap with cargo binding ; rather , concomitant PIPKI and YXXØ - sequence engagement by µ 2 appears to stimulate the catalytic activity of the lipid kinase ( Krauss et al . , 2006 ) . 2 . 3 . 2 The PIPKI γ 661 binding surface upon AP - 2 To attempt to resolve whether the β 2 or µ 2 subunit of AP - 2 represents a dominant interaction partner for the C - terminal 26 amino acid extension of PIPKI γ 661 , we used baculovirus - encoded AP - 2 hemicomplexes ( Figure 2 . 2C ) ( Doray et al . , 2007 ) . First , we verified that the individual chains expressed in Sf9 cells associate into a macromolecular complex . Anti - FLAG immunoprecipitation shows that removal of the FLAG - tagged β 2 subunit also depletes the µ 2 subunit from the lysate ( Figure 2 . 2A , compare lane a and b ) . The relative stoichiometry of the assembled β 2 ⋅µ 2 hemicomplex is seen on the Coomassie blue - stained gel ( lane c ) . Likewise , a FLAG - tagged β 2 - subunit trunk , lacking the C - terminal 359 residues encoding the unstructured hinge as well as the appendage domain , immunoprecipitates along with the co - expressed µ 2 ( lane f ) . This is expected , as µ 2 binds to the α - helical solenoid portion of the β 2 subunit trunk ( Collins et al . , 2002 ) . These experiments confirm the assembly of the β 2 ⋅µ 2 and β 2 trunk ⋅µ 2 hemicomplexes . Notably , the putative insect β subunit , recognized by the anti - β mAb , was not depleted from the lysates with the anti - FLAG mAb ( lanes b and e ) . 48 Figure 2 . 2 : An AP - 2 hemicomplex can bind YXX ∅ sorting signals . ( A ) Equivalent volumes of Sf9 cell lysate overexpressing either the β 2· µ 2 or the β 2 trunk· µ 2 hemicomplex before ( lanes a and d ) or after ( lanes b and e ) immunoprecipitation with agarose - coupled anti - FLAG mAb M2 , and aliquots from the washed and FLAG - peptide eluted immunprecipitate pellet ( lane c and f ) were resolved by SDS - PAGE and either stained with Coomassie blue or transferred to nitrocellulose . Portions of the blots were probed with anti - β 1 / β 1 - subunit mAb 100 / 1 or anti - µ 2 serum , and only the relevant portions shown . The migration position of the molecular mass standards is indicated on the left , and the location of the immuoprecipitated β 2 subunit ( black arrowhead ) , β 2 trunk ( open arrowhead ) and µ 2 subunit ( white arrowheads ) are shown . ( B ) Approximately 250 µ g of GST ( lanes a , b , e and f ) or GST - CI - MPR ( YSKV ; lanes c , d , g and h ) immobilized on glutathione - Sepharose was incubated with Sf9 - cell lysates overexpressing either the β 2· µ 2 ( lanes a - d ) or β 2 trunk· µ 2 ( lanes e - h ) hemicomplexes as indicated . After centrifugation , aliquots of ~ 1 . 5 % of each supernatant ( S ) and ~ 12 . 5 % of each washed pellet ( P ) were resolved by SDS - PAGE and either stained with Coomassie blue or transferred to nitrocellulose . Portions of the blots were probed with anti - β 1 / β 1 - subunit mAb 100 / 1 or anti - µ 2 serum , and only the relevant portions shown . ( C ) Schematic representation of the AP - 2 β 2 ⋅µ 2 hemicomplex used in ( A ) and ( B ) . 49 The capability of the two hemicomplexes to bind comparably to YXXØ - type sorting signals , which are recognized by the µ 2 subunit ( Ohno et al . , 1995 ; Owen and Evans , 1998 ) , is seen with a portion of the CI - MPR cytoplasmic domain ( residues 2337 - 2372 ) fused to glutathione - S - transferase ( GST ) ( Figure 2 . 2B ) ( Doray et al . , 2007 ) . While there is no association of either the FLAG - β 2 subunit or µ 2 with GST ( lanes b and f ) , some of both the β 2 and µ 2 protein are recovered in the pellet fraction from GST - CI - MPR affinity isolations ( lanes d and h ) . Still , none of the presumptive Sf9 AP - 2 ( β subunit ) binds to the GST - CI - MPR ( lanes f and h ) , and the relative stoichiometry of the bound µ 2 compared with the soluble fraction is greater than either the β 2 full - length or β 2 trunk ( lanes d and h ) . We interpret this to indicate that µ 2 alone ( uncomplexed ) has the highest apparent affinity for YXXØ signals , although the strength of this interaction is still rather weak . Some of the binary β 2 ⋅µ 2 or β 2 trunk ⋅µ 2 complexes also clearly associate with GST - CI - MPR but the failure of heterotetrameric AP - 2 to bind appreciably is fully consistent with the cytosolic pool of AP - 2 assuming a basal , closed conformation that blocks the YXXØ binding site on µ 2 ( Collins et al . , 2002 ) . Similar experiments using the C - terminal region of the PIPKI γ 635 or PIPKI γ 661 kinase variants ( Ishihara et al . , 1998 ) show that only the long - splice isoform associates with the  β 2 ⋅µ 2 hemicomplex ( Figure 2 . 3 , lane j ) . In fact , the presence of the full - length β 2 subunit bound to GST - PIPKI γ  ( 460 - 661 ) can be seen by Coomassie blue staining . By contrast , if incubated with either GST or GST - PIPKI γ  46 635 ) , there is complete reco very of the full - length or the β 2 trunk in the supernatant fraction ( lanes a , c , e and g ) . This shows that necessary AP - 2 binding information is indeed located within the terminal 26 residues of PIPKI γ 661 . Nevertheless , the β 2 trunk ⋅µ 2 hemicomplex does not associate with the GST - PIPKI γ ( 460 - 661 ) like the intact β 2 ⋅µ 2 hemicomplex ( compare lane l and j ) . 50 Figure 2 . 3 : The C terminus of PIPKI γ 661 but not PIPKI γ 635 binds selectively to the AP - 2 β 2 appendage . Approximately 200 µ g of GST ( lanes a - d ) , GST - PIPKI γ ( 460 - 635 ) ( lanes e - h ) or GST - PIPKI γ ( 460 - 661 ) immobilized on glutathione beads was incubated with incubated with Sf9 - cell lysates overexpressing either the β 2· µ 2 ( lanes a , b , e , f , i and j ) or β 2 trunk· µ 2 ( lanes c , d , g , h , k and l ) hemicomplexes . After centrifugation , aliquots of ~ 1 . 5 % of each supernatant ( S ) and ~ 15 % of each washed pellet ( P ) were resolved by SDS - PAGE and either stained with Coomassie blue or transferred to nitrocellulose . Portions of the blots were probed with anti - β 1 / β 1 - subunit mAb 100 / 1 , anti - FLAG mAb M1 or anti - µ 2 serum , and only the relevant portions shown . The migration positions of the FLAG - tagged β 2 ( arrowheads ) and the presumptive Sf9 cell β subunit ( open arrowheads ) are indicated . 51 There is a full - length β subunit recovered in the pull - down pellet after incubation with the β 2 - trunk lysate , but this chain does not contain a FLAG epitope ( lane l ) , and the bound  µ 2 migrates slightly slower than the expressed mammalian µ 2 subunit ( lane l ) . We thus conclude that although the β 2 trunk ⋅µ 2 fails to bind to the immobilized GST - PIPKI γ ( 460 - 661 ) , the endogenous Sf9 AP - 2 heterotetramer specifically engages the 26 amino - acid extension of PIPKI γ 661 since no binding is seen with the PIPKI γ ( 460 - 635 ) ( lane h ) . This is in sharp contrast to the lack of association of the endogenous invertebrate AP - 2 complex ( Sf9 AP - 2 ) with a GST - presented YXXØ sorting signal ( Figure 2 . 2B ) . In other experiments to assure that the FLAG - epitope - negative , ~ 100 - kDa β - immunoreactive band and the slower mobility µ 2 subunit are indeed constituents of the Sf9 cell AP - 2 , we used affinity isolation with a C - terminal segment of ARH . ARH contains a single [ DE ] n X 1 - 2 FXX [ FL ] XXXR AP - 2 - binding motif that binds exclusively to the β 2 subunit appendage ( He et al . , 2002 ; Mishra et al . , 2002b ; Edeling et al . , 2006a ; Schmid et al . , 2006 ) . The GST - ARHM2 fusion contains a 20 amino acid tract that fully contains this interaction motif ( Mishra et al . , 2005 ) that quantitatively removes the presumptive Sf9 cell β subunit from the supernatant and is recovered in the pellet fraction ( data not shown ) . Furthermore , when bound to the immobilized ARH β - subunit interaction motif , the slower mobility µ 2 form is detected ( data not shown ) . These studies reveal that the β and µ 2 bands observed indeed represent the endogenous invertebrate AP - 2 present in the Sf9 cell lysates . The 26 amino acid extension of PIPKI γ 661 also binds physically to the FERM domain of the integrin - associated protein talin , allowing regulated PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 formation at focal adhesions ( Di Paolo et al . , 2002 ; Ling et al . , 2002 ) . Accordingly , the ~ 230 - kDa insect talin in lysates of either β 2 ⋅µ 2 ( Figure 2 . 3 , lane j ) or β 2 trunk ⋅µ 2 ( lane l ) binds to the GST - PIPKI γ ( 460 - 52 661 ) but not ( 460 - 635 ) ( lanes f and h ) , as expected . Overall , we conclude from this series of experiments that the β 2 appendage of the AP - 2 complex , and not the µ 2 subunit , is the major site for PIPKI γ 661 interaction under these conditions . This interpretation is in full accord with a recent independent study ( Nakano - Kobayashi et al . , 2007 ) . 2 . 3 . 3 PIPKI γ 661 appendage selectivity The AP - 2 complex has two independently folded appendages that project away from the central heterotetrameric core ( see Figure 1 . 2 ) . Despite only ~ 11 % sequence identity , the α - and β 2 - subunit appendages have an analogous overall fold ( Owen et al . , 2000 ) and share many binding partners ( Edeling et al . , 2006a ; Schmid et al . , 2006 ) ; therefore , the appendages could either be indiscriminately or selectively accessed by PIPKI γ 661 . In fact , PIPKI γ 661 shows a striking selectivity for the β 2 appendage over the α . Pull - down assays show that the GST - α and GST - β 2 appendages bind to similar and different subsets of CLASPs and accessory factors ( Figure 2 . 4 , lanes d and f ) . While both bind to AP180 , epsin 1 , and eps15 roughly equally , only GST - β 2 binds to PIPKI γ 661 ( Figure 2 . 4 , lane d , right ) . This is reminiscent of the strict preference of ARH and β - arrestin for the β 2 appendage ( He et al . , 2002 ; Laporte et al . , 2002 ; Mishra et al . , 2002b ; Edeling et al . , 2006a ; Schmid et al . , 2006 ) . Significantly , the α appendage also has distinctive interaction partners ; the endocytic protein NECAP 1 binds only to GST - α , for example ( Figure 2 . 4 , lane f ) ( Ritter et al . , 2004 ) . Cdk5 is known to phosphorylate PIPKI γ 661 at Ser645 and dephosphorylation of this residue by calcineurin following calcium - induced synaptic vesicle exocytosis allows an interaction with AP - 2 to promote compensatory endocytosis ( Nakano - Kobayashi et al . , 2007 ) . Of the two bands detected by the anti - PIPKI γ mAb , 53 Figure 2 . 4 : PIPKI γ 661 discriminates between the AP - 2 α and β 2 appendages . Approximately 100 µ g of GST ( lanes a and b ) , GST - β 2 appendage ( lanes c and d ) or GST - α C appendage ( lanes e and f ) immobilized on gluthathione - Sepharose was incubated with rat brain cytosol as indicated . After centrifugation , aliquots of ~ 1 . 5 % of each supernatant ( S ) and ~ 10 % of each washed pellet ( P ) were resolved by SDS - PAGE and either stained with Coomassie blue or transferred to nitrocellulose . Portions of the blots were probed with anti - PIPKI γ mAb clone 12 , anti - AP180 mAb clone 34 , or affinity - purified anti - eps15 , epsin 1 or NECAP 1 antibodies , and only the relevant portions shown . The different migration of the non - phosphorylated ( arrowhead ) and phosphorylated ( pPIPKI γ ) forms of PIPKI γ is indicated . 54 Figure 2 . 5 : PIPKI γ 661 directly engages the β 2 appendage . Approximately 5 µ g of His 6 - tagged β 2 hinge + appendage ( H + A ; lanes c - ) immobilized on Ni - NTA - agarose was incubated with ~ 25 µ g GST ( lanes c and d ) , GST - PIPKI γ ( 460 - 635 ) ( lanes e and f ) , GST - PIPKI γ ( 460 - 661 ) ( lanes g and h ) or GST - PIPKI γ ( 460 - 661 with a phosphomimetic S645E mutation ) ( lanes i and j ) as indicated in the presence of carrier BSA . GST - PIPKI γ ( 460 - 661 ) was also incubated with Ni - NTA - agarose alone ( lanes a and b ) . After centrifugation , aliquots of ~ 2 . 5 % of each supernatant ( S ) and ~ 25 % of each washed pellet ( P ) were resolved by SDS - PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue . 55 only the lower band , which corresponds to the unphosphorylated protein , binds to β 2 , consistent with previous findings ( Nakano - Kobayashi et al . , 2007 ) . 2 . 3 . 4 PIPKI γ 661 directly engages the β 2 appendage In binary interaction assays , when immobilized His 6 - tagged AP - 2 β 2 hinge + appendage is incubated with soluble GST - PIPKI γ ( 460 - 661 ) , the two proteins interact and PIPKI γ is recovered in the pellet with the β 2 hinge + appendage ( Figure 2 . 5 , lane h ) . Conversely , the C - terminal segment of the PIPKI γ short - splice isoform ( GST - PIPKI γ  ( 460 - 635 ) ) does not bind the β 2 hinge + appendage and remains in the supernatant ( Figure 2 . 5 , lane e ) , as does GST ( lane c ) . This corroborates a direct interaction between PIPKI γ 661 and the β 2 appendage mediated by the 26 amino acid extension of the long splice isoform . Furthermore , a phosphomimetic S645E mutant in a GST - PIPKI γ ( 460 - 661 ) background has a sharply reduced ability to bind β 2 ( Figure 2 . 5 , lane j ) in the direct interaction assay . 2 . 3 . 5 PIPKI γ 661 binds the β 2 appendage sandwich domain Like the AP - 2 α appendage , the β 2 appendage plays an integral role in recruiting CLASPs and accessory factors to sites of endocytosis by acting as an organizational hub ( Owen et al . , 2000 ; Edeling et al . , 2006a ; Schmid et al . , 2006 ; Keyel et al . , 2008 ) . The β 2 appendage contains two rigidly apposed functional surfaces : an N - terminal , β - sheet - containing sandwich subdomain and a C - terminal , α - helix - and β - sheet - containing platform subdomain ( Owen et al . , 2000 ) . Mutation and co - crystallization studies reveal the two sites bind to discrete sets of endocytic 56 Figure 2 . 6 : PIPKI γ 661 physically contacts the sandwich subdomain of the AP - 2 β 2 appendage . ( A ) Approximately 100 µ g of GST ( lanes a and b ) , GST - β 2 appendage ( lanes c and d ) or GST - β 2 Y888V ( lanes e and f ) or Y815A ( lanes g and h ) mutant appendage immobilized on gluthathione - Sepharose was incubated with rat brain cytosol as indicated . After centrifugation , aliquots of ~ 1 . 5 % of each supernatant ( S ) and ~ 10 % of each washed pellet ( P ) were resolved by SDS - PAGE and either stained with Coomassie blue or transferred to nitrocellulose . Portions of the blots were probed with anti - PIPKI γ mAb clone 12 , anti - AP180 mAb clone 34 , or affinity - purified anti - eps15 antibodies , and only the relevant portions shown . The slowed migration of the phosphorylated from of PIPKI γ ( pPIPKI γ ) is indicated , as is the location of the Coomassie - blue stained epsin 1 band . ( B ) Approximately 100 µ g of GST ( lane a and b ) or GST - β 2 appendage ( lanes c - f ) immobilized on glutathione - Sepharose was incubated with rat brain cytosol in the absence or presence of 2 µ M eps15 ( 622 - 736 ) competitor polypeptide ( lanes e and f ) as indicated . After centrifugation , aliquots of ~ 1 . 5 % of each supernatant ( S ) and ~ 10 % of each washed pellet ( P ) were resolved by SDS - PAGE and either stained with Coomassie blue or transferred to nitrocellulose . Portions of the blots were probed with anti - PIPKI γ mAb clone 12 , anti - amphiphysin mAb clone 15 , anti - AP180 mAb clone 34 , or anti - eps15 antibodies , and only the relevant portions shown . The slowed migration of the phosphorylated from of PIPKI γ ( pPIPKI γ ) is indicated , as is the location of the Coomassie - blue stained epsin 1 band . 57 proteins ( Edeling et al . , 2006a ; Schmid et al . , 2006 ) . To determine whether PIPKI γ 661 interacts with either of these sites , we mutated select residues critical for binding at each surface . A Y888V mutation in the β 2 platform subdomain has no effect on the binding of PIPKI γ or the established sandwich - binding partners AP180 and eps15 ( Figure 2 . 6A , lane d and f ) . This alteration does reduce epsin 1 binding ( 49 , 50 ) . By contrast , a Y815A sandwich subdomain mutation completely eliminates the binding of PIPKI γ 661 , AP180 , and eps15 , while epsin 1 binding is essentially unaffected ( Figure 2 . 6A , lane h ) . These results indicate that PIPKI γ 661 associates directly with the sandwich subdomain of the β 2 appendage . Competition experiments in which the immobilized GST - β 2 is incubated with cytosol and an eps15 polypeptide encompassing the region co - crystallized with β 2 appendage at the sandwich site ( 50 ) confirm the contact site . Alone , the GST - β 2 recovers the typical cohort of soluble endocytic proteins ( Figure 2 . 6B , lane d ) . Addition of the eps15 polypeptide to the mixture substantially reduces PIPKI γ 661 and amphiphysin I and - II binding ( Figure 2 . 6B , lane f ) . AP180 binding is clearly reduced , although not to the same extent as the kinase ( lane f ) . 2 . 3 . 6 Delineation of the PIPKI γ 661 AP - 2 interaction motif Since the PIPKI γ ( 460 - 661 ) but not the - ( 460 - 635 ) binds to the AP - 2 β 2 appendage , we evaluated whether just the terminal 28 amino acids of the human PIPKI γ 668 variant ( also termed PIP5K I γ 90 ( Di Paolo et al . , 2002 ) ) are sufficient for this interaction . AP - 2 binds to only the 28 - residue extension considerably weaker than in the context of the 460 - 661 fragment in a GST pull - down assay ( Figure 2 . 6 , compare lane f and h ) . Yet , in the same assay , the extent of the association with talin is similar for both GST fusions ( Figure 2 . 6 ) . This could indicate 58 Figure 2 . 7 : The alternatively spliced C terminus of PIPKI γ alone does not contain all the AP - 2 binding information . Approximately 200 µ g of GST ( lanes a and b ) , GST - PIPKI γ ( 460 - 635 ) ( lanes c and d ) , GST - Hs PIPKI γ ( 641 - 668 ) ( lanes e and f ) , GST - PIPKI γ ( 460 - 661 ) ( lanes g and h ) , GST - PIPKI γ ( 460 - 661 / S645E ) ( lanes i and j ) or GST - ARH ( 180 - 308 ) ( lanes k and l ) immobilized on glutathione - Sepharose was incubated with rat brain cytosol as indicated . After centrifugation , aliquots of ~ 1 . 5 % of each supernatant ( S ) and ~ 10 % of each washed pellet ( P ) were resolved by SDS - PAGE and either stained with Coomassie blue or transferred to nitrocellulose . Portions of the blots were probed with anti - clathrin heavy chain ( HC ) mAb TD . 1 and anti - β 1 / β 2 subunit mAb 100 / 1 , anti - AP - 2 α subunit mAb C4 , or anti - talin mAb 8d4 , and only the relevant portions shown . The position of talin ( red arrowhead ) and the AP - 2 β 2 and α subunits ( black arrowhead ) on the stained gel is shown . Note that PIPKI γ 661 clearly binds to the β 2 appendage of AP - 2 more weakly than ARH , which has a K D for AP - 2 of ~ 2 µ M ( Edeling et al . , 2006a ; Schmid et al . , 2006 ) . 59 that while talin binds only the 26 / 28 amino acid extension in PIPKI γ 661 / 668 , AP - 2 may bind primarily to this same region but depend on a distinct secondary structural element or be stabilized by an adjacent region ( s ) within residues 460 - 635 . Using controlled tryptic proteolysis of bacterially expressed 460 - 635 and 460 - 661 polypeptides derived from PIPKI γ , a hierarchical sequence of degradation fragments is observed ( Figure 2 . 8A ) . Immunoblots with either a mAb that detects both PIPKI γ 635 and - 661 or affinity - purified antibodies that detect the 26 amino - acid extension of PIPKI γ 661 reveal that both epitopes are efficiently removed by low concentrations of trypsin . This is in contrast to the stably folded bacterial chaperone DnaK , co - purified with the PIPKI γ peptides , that is unaffected by lower trypsin concentrations ( Figure 2 . 8A ) . Neither antibody reacts with the more stable PIPKI γ fragments . Additionally , circular dichroism analysis of the 460 - 635 and 460 - 661 protein segments indicate that both are essentially unstructured ( Figure 2 . 8B ) . Indeed , the 460 - 661 polypeptide is resistant to denaturation at 100°C , as are the C - terminal portions of the natively unstructured endocytic proteins epsin 1 and AP180 ( Kalthoff et al . , 2002 ) . We believe the intrinsic disorder of the C - terminal region of PIPKI γ makes it unlikely that the difference in AP - 2 binding between the GST - PIPKI γ ( 460 - 661 ) and GST - Hs PIPK1 γ ( 641 - 668 ) ( equivalent to the mouse 636 - 661 ) is due to secondary structural elements . Instead , residues at the junction of the 635 and 661 splice isoforms may contribute to AP - 2 β 2 - appendage binding . To examine this further , we used a third rodent PIPKI γ splice variant , PIPKI γ 687 ( also termed PIPkin I γ C ( Giudici et al . , 2004 ) or PIPkin Ig93 ( Giudici et al . , 2006 ) ) , which contains a distinct 26 amino - acid insert positioned between the C - terminus of PIPKI γ 635 and the N - terminus of PIPKI γ 661 26 amino - acid insert ( Figure 2 . 9 ) . Interestingly , separating the C - terminal end of the 635 splice isoform from the 661 insert in this configuration diminishes AP - 2 binding to roughly that seen 60 Figure 2 . 8 : The PIPKI γ 661 C terminus lacks secondary structure . ( A ) Aliquots ( 20 µ g ) of PIPKI γ ( 460 - 635 ) ( lanes a - f ) or PIPKI γ ( 460 - 661 ) ( lanes g - l ) were incubated alone or with 1 : 5 serial fivefold dilutions of trypsin ( 0 . 6 - 375 ng ) in 50 mM Tris pH 8 . 0 , 150 mM NaCl , 5 mM CaCl 2 , 1 mM DTT at 37 ° C for 1 hour . Proteolysis was stopped by the addition of 95°C SDS sample buffer and aliquots of 10 % of each reaction resolved by SDS - PAGE either stained with Coomassie blue or transferred to nitrocellulose . The PIPKI γ ( 460 - 661 ) portion of the blot was probed with anti - PIPKI γ mAb clone 12 that recognizes both isoforms or with an affinity purified antibody that recognizes only the PIPKI γ 661 isoform . ( B ) Circular dichroism spectra of PIPKI γ ( 460 - 635 ) ( open circles ) , PIPKI γ ( 460 - 661 ) ( triangles ) , and epsin 1 ENTH domain ( squares ) polypeptides were measured in 25 mM potassium phosphate + 1 mM DTT . Measurements were made from 280 nm to 185 nm at 1 nm increments and the spectra were baseline corrected and represent the average of five ( PIPKI γ ) or three ( ENTH ) runs . Note the signature α - helical features of the globular ENTH domain compared with the unstructured PIPKI γ polypeptides . 61 Figure 2 . 9 : Schematic of the three PIPKI γ splice variants .

Identical residues colored pink and conservatively substituted residues yellow . The location of the talin - binding motif is indicated above , and the GST - fusion proteins spanning the junction between the PIPKI γ 635 and - 661 isoforms tested below . 62 Figure 2 . 10 : Differing partner binding properties of the three PIPKI γ splice variants . ( A ) Approximately 200 µ g of GST ( lanes a and b ) , GST - PIPKI γ ( 460 - 635 ) ( lanes c and d ) , GST - PIPKI γ ( 460 - 661 ) ( lanes e and f ) , or GST - PIPKI γ ( 460 - 687 ) ( lanes g and h ) immobilized on glutathione - Sepharose was incubated with rat brain cytosol as indicated . After centrifugation , aliquots of 1 . 5 % of each supernatant ( S ) and 10 % of each washed pellet ( P ) were resolved by SDS - PAGE and either stained with Coomassie blue or transferred to nitrocellulose . Portions of the blots were probed with anti - clathrin heavy chain ( HC ) mAb TD . 1 and anti - β 1 / β 2 subunit mAb 100 / 1 , or with anti - talin mAb 8d4 and only the relevant portions shown . ( B ) Approximately 200 µ g of GST ( lanes a and b ) , GST - PIPKI γ ( 460 - 635 ) ( lanes c and d ) , GST - PIPKI γ ( 460 - 661 ) ( lanes e and f ) , GST - PIPKI γ ( 636 - 661 ) ( lanes g and h ) , GST - PIPKI γ ( 630 - 661 ) ( lanes i and j ) , or GST - PIPKI γ ( 624 - 661 ) ( lanes k and l ) immobilized on glutathione - Sepharose was incubated with rat brain cytosol as indicated . After centrifugation , aliquots of 1 . 5 % of each supernatant ( S ) and 10 % of each washed pellet ( P ) were resolved by SDS - PAGE and either stained with Coomassie blue or transferred to nitrocellulose . Portions of the blots were probed with anti - clathrin heavy chain ( HC ) mAb TD . 1 and anti - β 1 / β 2 subunit mAb 100 / 1 , or anti - talin mAb 8d4 , and only the relevant portions shown . The position of talin ( open arrowhead ) and the AP - 2 β 2 and α C subunits ( black arrowhead ) on the stained gel is shown . 63 with the GST - PIPKI γ ( 460 - 635 ) alone ( Figure 2 . 10A ) . This indicates that residues proximal to the 26 amino - acid insert may contribute to the engagement of the β 2 appendage of the AP - 2 adaptor . Indeed , a pair of constructs that include the last six ( GST - PIPKI γ ( 630 - 661 ) ) or twelve ( GST - PIPKI γ ( 624 - 661 ) ) residues of PIPKI γ 635 have dramatically increased AP - 2 binding capability compared with the mouse PIPKI γ 661 C - terminus alone fused to GST ( GST - PIPKI γ 636 - 661 ) ) ( Figure 2 . 10B ) . There is little change in the interaction with talin for these fusion proteins however . These results confirm then that the extreme C - terminal region of the PIPKI γ 635 splice isoform contributes to binding to the AP - 2 β 2 appendage but , alone , is insufficient for associating with AP - 2 . 2 . 3 . 7 The β 2 sandwich subdomain contact surface A yeast two - hybrid interaction screen with the PIPKI γ 630 - 661 peptide fused to the DNA binding domain of Gal4p corroborates that this sequence engages the sandwich subdomain of the β 2 appendage . Transformed AH109 yeast grow on quadruple dropout selection plates only when expressing both the PIPKI γ ( 630 - 661 ) and β 2 appendage but not either protein alone ( Figure 2 . 11A ) . Site - directed mutagenesis of selected residues on the β 2 appendage shows a Y888V mutation , which disrupts the platform interaction site ( Owen et al . , 2000 ) , has no effect on PIPKI γ interaction . By contrast the Y815A substitution , as well as alteration of several other side chains that contribute to the sandwich site interaction surface ( Gln756 , Gln804 , Ala806 and Lys808 ; Figure 2 . 11B ) ( Edeling et al . , 2006a ; Schmid et al . , 2006 ) strongly impede the binding to the PIPKI γ C - terminal 630 - 661 polypeptide ( Figure 2 . 11A ) . 64 Figure 2 . 11 : AP - 2 - PIPKI γ interaction in a yeast two - hybrid assay . ( A ) Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain AH109 transformed with the indicated Gal4 pGBKT7 binding domain ( BD ) pGADT7 activation domain ( AD ) plasmid combinations were spotted onto SD minimal medium plates lacking either Leu and Trp , or Ade , His , Leu , and Trp and grown at 30°C . ( B ) Ribbon representation ( PDB accession : 2G30 ) of the AP - 2 β 2 appendage sandwich subdomain indicating the location of important side chains ( blue , nitrogen ; red , oxygen ) involved in accommodating the PIPKI γ 661 C - terminal interaction motif . Shown in stick representation ( gold ) is the location of co - crystallizing AAF peptide that demarcates a portion of the binding surface upon the β 2 appendage sandwich subdomain . 65 2 . 3 . 8 Pinpointing key anchor residues in PIPKI γ necessary for β 2 appendage engagement Having delineated the AP - 2 β 2 interaction motif in PIPKI γ 661 to a tract of ~ 20 residues , we next tested the importance of selected hydrophobic side chains within this region . This is because for all characterized adaptors and accessory factors that associate with the α and β 2 appendages , aromatic residue - containing motifs are critically important binding determinants , such as the DP [ FW ] motif in eps15 and epsin ( Maldonado - Baez and Wendland , 2006 ) , the WXX [ FW ] X [ DE ] n motif in SJ170 ( Jha et al . , 2004 ) , NECAP ( Ritter et al . , 2004 ) and stonin 2 ( Mishra et al . , 2004 ; Walther et al . , 2004 ) , and the [ DE ] n X 1 - 2 FXX [ FL ] XXXR motif in ARH and β - arrestin ( Edeling et al . , 2006a ; Schmid et al . , 2006 ) . There are five phylogenetically conserved aromatic residues in the mapped PIPKI γ AP - 2 binding region ( Figure 2 . 9 and 2 . 12A ) . Two , Trp642 and Tyr644 , are vicinal to Ser645 , which inhibits AP - 2 binding when phosphorylated ( Figure 2 . 5 ) ( Nakano - Kobayashi et al . , 2007 ) . Both a W642A mutation and a more conservative phenylalanine substitution ( W642F ) eliminate β 2 binding ( Figure 2 . 12B and 2 . 13A , lanes f and h ) in either binary GST pull - down assays ( Figure 2 . 12B ) or with rat brain cytosol ( Figure 2 . 13A ) . Likewise , a Y644A change eliminates β 2 - appendage binding ( Figure 2 . 12B and 2 . 13A , lane j ) but the conservative Y644F mutation reduces , but does not abolish , β 2 engagement ( Figure 2 . 12B and 2 . 13A , lane l ) . This finding is significant because alignment of the sequences that follow the C - terminal IYF of the I γ 635 isoform in either the I γ 661 or I γ 687 variants shows some obvious similarities ( Figure 2 . 12A ) . The longest I γ 687 insert has a Trp positioned analogously to Trp642 in I γ 661 and a Phe at the position equivalent to Tyr644 . In fact , five of the eleven N - terminal residues are identical between the two alternatively spliced proteins and two conservatively substituted ( Figure 2 . 12A ) . Nevertheless , the I γ 687 protein does not bind to AP - 2 66 Figure 2 . 12 : Delineation of key anchor residues that mediate PIPKI γ 661 binding to the β 2 appendage . ( A ) Primary sequence alignment of the two PIPKI γ 26 amino acid inserts and comparison with a tract from eps15 that also bind to the AP - 2 β 2 appendage sandwich subdomain . ( B ) Approximately 40 µ g of His 6 - tagged β 2 hinge + appendage immobilized on Ni - NTA - agarose was incubated with ~ 10 µ g GST ( lanes a and b ) , GST - PIPKI γ ( 460 - 661 ) wild type ( WT , lanes c and d ) , or GST - PIPKI γ ( 460 - 661 ) containing W642A ( lanes e and f ) , W642F ( lanes g and h ) , Y644A ( lanes i and j ) , or Y644F ( lanes k and l ) mutations in the presence of carrier BSA . After centrifugation , aliquots of ~ 4 % of each supernatant ( S ) and ~ 25 % of each washed pellet ( P ) were resolved by SDS - PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue . 67 Figure 2 . 13 : Delineation of key anchor residues that mediate PIPKI γ 661 binding to the β 2 appendage , continued . ( A ) Approximately 250 µ g GST ( lanes a and b ) , GST - PIPKI γ ( 460 - 661 ) wild type ( WT , lanes c and d ) , or GST - PIPKI γ ( 460 - 661 ) containing W642A ( lanes e and f ) , W642F ( lanes g and h ) , Y644A ( lanes i and j ) or Y644F ( lanes k and l ) mutations immobilized on glutathione - Sepharose was incubated with rat brain cytosol as indicated .

( B ) Approximately 100 µ g GST ( lanes a and b ) , GST - PIPKI γ ( 624 - 661 ) wild type ( WT , lanes c and d ) or GST - PIPKI γ ( 624 - 661 ) containing I633A ( lanes e and f ) , Y634A ( lanes g and h ) , F635A ( lanes i and j ) , W642A ( lanes k and l ) , Y644A ( lanes m and n ) or Y649A ( lanes o and p ) mutations immobilized on glutathione - Sepharose was incubated with rat brain cytosol as indicated . After centrifugation , aliquots of ~ 1 . 5 supernatant ( S ) and ~ 10 % of each pellet ( P ) were resolved by SDS - PAGE and either stained with Coomassie blue or transferred to nitrocellulose . Portions of the blot were probed with anti - β 1 / β 2 - subunit mAb 100 / 1 and anti - clathrin heavy chain ( HC ) mAb TD . 1 or anti - talin mAb 8d4 . 68 efficiently ( Figure 2 . 10A ) , presumably in part because of the natural Phe - for - Tyr substitution . The pair of aromatics at the end of the I γ 635 sequence are also important ; a double Tyr634 and Phe635 to Ala substitution ( YF → AA ) in the context of the GST - I γ ( 460 - 661 ) fusion protein diminishes AP - 2 binding to the level seen with just the 26 amino - acid extension of the I γ 661 isoform ( data not shown ) . Separate Y634A and F635A mutations in the GST - PIPKI γ ( 624 - 661 ) fusion backbone reveal that Phe635 is critical while Tyr634 is somewhat less so , as there is still some AP - 2 bound to the fusion protein with a Y364A mutation ( Figure 2 . 13B ) . By contrast , converting Ile633 to Ala does not diminish the binding of AP - 2 when compared with the wild - type protein . As seen with the GST - I γ ( 460 - 661 ) fusions , Trp642 and Tyr644 are vital residues for β subunit engagement . The Y649A switch , located 13 residues after the intersection between the 635 and 661 splice forms , shows that this amino acid also contributes weakly to AP - 2 binding . The lack of a bulky aromatic residue equivalent to Tyr649 in the I γ 687 longest - splice isoform , as well as other substitutions , may also contribute to the poor interaction with AP - 2 . This set of mutations has a different effect on talin binding . Only the W642A and Y644A mutants exhibit greatly diminished binding to cytosolic talin ( Figure 2 . 13B ) , which is in accord with the mapped talin binding region ( see Figure 2 . 9 ) ( Di Paolo et al . , 2002 ; Ling et al . , 2002 ; Ling et al . , 2003 ) and structural studies of the talin FERM F3 subdomain engaged with PIPKI γ peptide ( de Pereda et al . , 2005 ; Kong et al . , 2006 ) . Altogether , these data indicate that aromatic residues contribute to β 2 - sandwich subdomain binding possibly through inserting into complementary hydrophobic surfaces in the appendage . The results also confirm the important role of Tyr644 in AP - 2 binding ( Bairstow et al . , 2006 ) , but argue strongly against the kinase - AP - 2 interaction being YXXØ - mediated , because those interactions are critically dependent on the 69 proximal tyrosine that cannot be replaced functionally by phenylalanine ( Collawn et al . , 1990 ; Jadot et al . , 1992 ) . 2 . 3 . 9 Clathrin is displaced from the AP - 2 β 2 appendage by PIPKI γ 661 An additional endocytic coat protein that binds to the sandwich subdomain of the AP - 2 β 2 appendage is the clathrin heavy chain ( Owen et al . , 2000 ; Edeling et al . , 2006a ; Knuehl et al . , 2006 ; Keyel et al . , 2008 ) . Rather than utilizing a short unstructured interaction motif to contact the β 2 appendage , the clathrin heavy chain interaction surface is located within the distal leg ( Knuehl et al . , 2006 ) , comprised of repeating antiparallel α - helices in a solenoid - type fold ( ter Haar et al . , 1998 ; Ybe et al . , 1999 ) . Although clathrin is a functional trimer , we nevertheless examined whether PIPKI γ 661 and clathrin compete for a common binding surface on the β 2 appendage . Supplementing whole cytosol with a PIPKI γ 624 - 661 polypeptide interferes with clathrin binding to immobilized GST - β 2 appendage in a dose - dependent manner ( Figure 2 . 14A ) . The peptide competitor also abolishes endogenous PIPKI γ 661 and AP180 binding , but leaves epsin 1 still attached to the β 2 appendage , further arguing that it binds to the sandwich subdomain . By contrast , adding a I γ 624 - 661 peptide containing a W642A substitution has a weak , if any effect on clathrin , PIPKI γ 661 or AP180 binding ( Figure 2 . 14A ) . If clathrin engagement by the larger β 2 subunit hinge + appendage domains is followed under the same conditions , the triskelia bind much more avidly to the immobilized GST - β 2 fragment ( Figure 2 . 14B , compare lanes f and j ) . The I γ 624 - 661 peptide now competes with clathrin only weakly ( Figure 2 . 14B , compare lanes j and l ) . Yet the added excess peptide does effectively compete PIPKI γ and AP180 off the β 2 hinge + appendage , 70 Figure 2 . 14 : Mutually exclusive engagement of the β 2 appendage sandwich by either PIPKI γ 661 or clathrin . ( A ) Approximately 100 µ g GST ( lanes a and b ) or GST - β 2 appendage ( lanes c - l ) immobilized on glutathione - Sepharose was incubated with rat brain cytosol alone ( lanes a - d ) or cytosol supplemented with 46 µ M wild type ( lanes e and f ) or W642A ( lanes i and j ) PIPKI γ ( 624 - 661 ) peptide or 139 µ M wild type ( lanes g and h ) or W642A ( lanes k and l ) PIPKI γ ( 624 - 661 ) peptide . After centrifugation , aliquots of ~ 1 . 5 % of each supernatant ( S ) and ~ 10 % of each washed pellet ( P ) were resolved by SDS - PAGE and either stained with Coomassie blue or transferred to nitrocellulose . Portions of the blots were probed with anti - clathrin heavy chain ( HC ) mAb TD . 1 , anti - PIPKI γ mAb clone 12 , anti - AP180 mAb clone 34 or affinity - purified anti - epsin 1 antibodies . Notice that although epsin 1 binding to the β 2 appendage is affected by the addition of the PIPKI γ peptide , particularly at the highest concentration , the sandwich - binding partners are clearly much more sensitive to the competitor . ( B ) Approximately 100 µ g GST ( lanes a - d ) , GST - β 2 appendage ( lanes e - h ) or GST - β 2 hinge + appendage ( lanes i - l ) immobilized on glutathione - Sepharose was incubated with rat brain cytosol alone ( lanes a , b , e , f , i and j ) or rat brain cytosol supplemented with 113 µ M PIPKI γ ( 624 - 661 ) polypeptide ( lanes c , d , g , h , k and l ) . After centrifugation , aliquots of ~ 1 . 5 % of each supernatant ( S ) and ~ 10 % of each washed pellet ( P ) were resolved by SDS - PAGE and either stained with Coomassie blue or transferred to nitrocellulose . Portions of the blots were probed with anti - clathrin heavy chain ( HC ) mAb TD . 1 , anti - PIPKI γ mAb clone 12 , or anti - AP180 mAb clone 34 . 71 Figure 2 . 15 : Mutually exclusive engagement of the β 2 appendage sandwich by either PIPKI γ 661 or clathrin , continued .

After centrifugation , aliquots of ~ 1 . 5 % of each supernatant ( S ) and ~ 10 % of each washed pellet ( P ) were resolved by SDS - PAGE and either stained with Coomassie blue or transferred to nitrocellulose . Portions of the blots were probed with anti - clathrin heavy chain ( HC ) mAb TD . 1 , anti - PIPKI γ mAb clone 12 , or anti - AP180 mAb clone 34 . ( B ) Fractions ( 20 µ g ) from a preparation of rat brain clathrin - coated vesicles were resolved by SDS - PAGE and either stained with Coomassie blue or transferred to nitrocellulose . Portions of the blots were probed with anti - clathrin light chain ( LC ) mAb Cl57 . 3 , anti - µ 2 subunit serum , affinity - purified anti - HIP1 antibodies , or anti - PIPKI γ mAb clone 12 . Only the relevant portions are shown . Note the strong enrichment of clathrin , AP - 2 and HIP1 ( arrowheads ) but exclusion PIPKI γ ( open arrowhead ) in the coated - vesicle fraction . 72 however ( Figure 2 . 9B , compare lanes j and l ) . This selectively refractory behavior is because the extra β 2 hinge region contains additional clathrin binding determinants that contact the N - terminal β - propeller of the clathrin heavy chain ( Gallusser and Kirchhausen , 1993 ; Owen et al . , 2000 ; ter Haar et al . , 2000 ) . The additional points of contact increase the apparent affinity of clathrin for the β 2 chain versus PIPKI γ 661 or eps15 ( Cupers et al . , 1998 ; Edeling et al . , 2006a ) . Thus , the AP - 2 β 2 subunit binds more tightly to multivalent clathrin trimers than monovalent PIPKI γ 661 . Like the PIPKI γ 624 - 661 segment , the whole C - terminal I γ 460 - 661 polypeptide also interferes with clathrin binding in the presence of cytosol , while the W642A mutant does not ( Figure 2 . 15A ) . A corollary of these results is that clathrin engagement could displace prebound PIPKI γ 661 from AP - 2 as the lattice assembly process progresses toward the deeply invaginated state . Circumstantial evidence for this contention comes from the marked de - enrichment of PIPKI γ 661 in preparations of rat brain clathrin - coated vesicles ( Figure 2 . 15B ) ( Wenk et al . , 2001 ) . These results imply that the temporal residence of PIPKI γ 661 at the bud site may be determined by the extent of clathrin lattice polymerization . 2 . 4 DISCUSSION Phosphoinositides are biologically useful signaling molecules in part because they fail to transfer rapidly between different membrane compartments in the absence of vesicular transport . These phospholipids can rapidly move laterally within the plane of the membrane . Bound to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , the diffusion coefficient of the PLC δ 1 PH domain ( Brough et al . , 2005 ; Hammond 73 et al . , 2009 ) approximates that of lipid alone within the plasma membrane bilayer ( Yaradanakul and Hilgemann , 2007 ; Golebiewska et al . , 2008 ) ; this could impact the action of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at discrete membrane patches on the cell surface . In addition , the inositol - lipid head group can be rapidly remodeled upon delivery to a new organelle , or even while within a forming coated bud or membrane - bounded transport vesicle . This plasticity of the head group , coupled with vectorial membrane flow , allows for differentially phosphorylated PtdIns P s to play critical regulatory roles along the secretory and endosomal pathways . Here , we demonstrate that the PIPKI γ 661 isoform binds physically to the sandwich subdomain of the AP - 2 β 2 subunit appendage . This interaction allows for the 5 - kinase to be strategically positioned during clathrin - coat assembly and to augment PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 production focally . A precedent for this type of localized regulation already exists ; the talin FERM domain engages the longer - splice isoforms of PIPKI γ ( using a sequence that overlaps the β 2 - appendage interaction motif ) , and this association coordinates PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 production at focal adhesion sites ( Di Paolo et al . , 2002 ; Ling et al . , 2002 ) . In eukaryotes , alternative splicing can increase genomic complexity and diversity . The organization of the C - terminal splice sites allows the synthesis of three distinct PIPKI γ variants : one ( PIPKI γ 687 ) can bind selectively to talin via the C - terminal extension , one ( PIPKI γ 661 ) to both talin and AP - 2 , and one ( PIPKI γ 635 ) to neither protein . This flexibility could impart importantly different biological functions to each isoform ( Mao et al . , 2009 ) . An additional level of regulation can fine - tune this variation as phosphorylation of Ser645 impedes AP - 2 ( Figure 2 . 5 ; ( Nakano - Kobayashi et al . , 2007 ) ) and talin ( Lee et al . , 2005 ) binding , while Tyr644 ( Tyr649 in the human isoform ) phosphorylation enhances the association with talin ( Ling et al . , 2003 ; Lee et al . , 2005 ; Kong et al . , 2006 ) . Intriguingly , Tyr634 is also subject to phosphorylation in 74 response to growth factors ( Sun et al . , 2007b ) . In the brain , PIPKI γ 661 is the major isoform at the presynaptic plasma membrane ( Wenk et al . , 2001 ; Di Paolo et al . , 2004 ) suggesting that the endocytic function of the kinase is paramount in this tissue . We mapped the AP - 2 interaction motif in PIPKI γ to a more expansive sequence than those typically recognized by the α appendage ( DP [ FW ] , FXDXF and WXX [ FW ] X [ DE ] n ) or even the platform site on the β 2 appendage ( [ DE ] n X 1 - 2 FXX [ FL ] XXXR ) . The sequence differs too from the 721 SFGDGFADF region of murine eps15 that also binds to the β 2 sandwich subdomain ( Schmid et al . , 2006 ) . A co - crystal with the β 2 appendage shows the eps15 sequence tract forms a tight turn that depends critically on the central Gly for proper positioning of the three Phe side chains ( Schmid et al . , 2006 ) . Because of the lack of a Gly within β 2 binding region of PIPKI γ 661 , and the altered spacing of the aromatic residues ( Figure 2 . 12A ) , it seems unlikely that the kinase and eps15 engage the β 2 sandwich site in precisely the same manner . Yet , the strict selectivity of PIPKI γ 661 for the sandwich subdomain makes the binding to AP - 2 subject to interference by clathrin , which can occupy the same interaction site ( Edeling et al . , 2006a ; Keyel et al . , 2008 ) . More important is that in the context of the assembled polyhedral lattice , the clathrin heavy chains project a profusion of terminal domains down into the interior of the assemblage ( ter Haar et al . , 1998 ; Edeling et al . , 2006a ) . In our view , this high density of clathrin coupled with the capability of the β 2 chain of AP - 2 to engage the clathrin heavy chain through at least two binding sites , will strongly favor AP - 2 associations with clathrin in regions of extensively assembled coat . In fact , in biochemical assays eps15 , which also binds to the AP - 2 β 2 appendage sandwich ( Edeling et al . , 2006a ; Schmid et al . , 2006 ) but not to clathrin , is displaced from AP - 2 by polymerizing clathrin ( Cupers et al . , 1998 ) . Accordingly , eps15 is restricted to the outer edge of clathrin lattices on the cell surface ( Tebar et al . , 1996 ; Edeling et 75 al . , 2006a ) . We propose that this hierarchical binding phenomenon offers a mechanism for temporal and spatial control of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 formation as a function of the extent of polymerized clathrin lattice . Coincidence detection is a common theme in the coordinated placement of clathrin - coat components necessary to drive bud progression ( Di Paolo and De Camilli , 2006 ) . We therefore cannot rule out that PIPKI γ 661 utilizes this by establishing secondary associations with the µ 2 subunit of AP - 2 , either through the YXXØ - interaction surface ( Bairstow et al . , 2006 ) or by binding of the catalytic core region to a distinct portion of µ 2 ( Krauss et al . , 2006 ) . Conceivably , these additional contacts could be precisely regulated by phosphorylation , as exposure of the µ 2 subunit to accommodate YXXØ sorting signals requires phosphorylation of Thr156 ( Olusanya et al . , 2001 ) . Perhaps this allows PIPKI γ 661 binding to be variably regulated at different points in the coat assembly cycle . However , because PIPKI γ 661 is not enriched in clathrin - coated vesicles purified from rat brain ( Figure 2 . 15B ; ( Wenk et al . , 2001 ) , and immunoEM reveals PIPKI γ on synaptic plasma membrane adjacent to , but not within , clathrin - coated buds ( Wenk et al . , 2001 ) , we favor the β 2 appendage as the site most able to manage this spatial positioning of the 5 - kinase during clathrin - mediated endocytosis at the nerve terminal . Intriguingly , PIPKI γ 661 binds to the AP - 2 β 2 appendage as well as the β 1 subunit of the AP - 1 heterotetramer ( Nakano - Kobayashi et al . , 2007 ) . In this regard , it is interesting that AP - 1 is implicated in return of certain integral membrane proteins from the recycling endosome compartment and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is the necessary phosphoinositide ( Crottet et al . , 2002 ) . Similar regulation by the clathrin heavy chain and / or possibly eps15 could occur as eps15 is located on endosomes and the TGN ( Chi et al . , 2008 ) , and the key residues that constitute the interaction surface on the β 2 appendage sandwich subdomain are all conserved in the AP - 1 β 1 chain ( Keyel et al . , 2008 ) . 76 The structurally related AP - 2 α and β 2 appendages contact a rich constellation of binding partners , some of which are common to both but nevertheless engage structurally non - equivalent surfaces on each appendage ( Edeling et al . , 2006a ; Schmid et al . , 2006 ) . A major , currently unresolved question is why certain proteins have evolved specific combinations of dissimilar AP - 2 ( and clathrin ) interaction motifs as opposed to utilizing standardized , generic connection elements ? Also , given the relatively low affinity of these interactions in general , how does a timed succession of protein occupancies lead to progressive coat assembly without misdirected protein placement or catastrophic entanglement ? One explanation is that binding events that occur at different locations upon the appendages utilizing particular peptide motifs generate different functional consequences , enabling the two proximate domains to act in concert to coordinate coat assembly . The coordination of PtdIns P metabolism at coated buds seems to be emblematic of this type of regulation . The 5 - kinase activity of PIPKIs is stimulated several fold by PtdOH ( Jenkins et al . , 1994 ; Ishihara et al . , 1998 ) . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis ceases rapidly ( < 5 min ) upon administration of 1 - 2 % 1 - butanol to cultured cells , and new lattice assembly is prevented ( Boucrot et al . , 2006 ) , illustrating the likely involvement of PtdOH in coat assembly and progression . We have shown previously that , in vitro , PtdOH can promote limited translocation of AP - 2 to biological membranes in the absence of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis ( Arneson et al . , 1999 ) . In fact , a positive feedback loop operates as the product of PIPKI activity , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , is a required activator of phospholipase D ( PLD ) ( Figure 5 . 2 ) ( Arneson et al . , 1999 ; Morris , 2007 ) . Primary alcohols interfere with PLD - catalyzed hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine ( PtdCho ) because a phosphatidylalcohol and not PtdOH is produced ( Jenkins and Frohman , 2005 ) . An alternative pathway for the generation of PtdOH is through the phosphorylation of DAG by diacylglycerol kinase ( DGK ; Figure 5 . 2 ) ( Merida et al . , 2008 ) . 77 Intriguingly , the PH domain - containing type II DGK , DGK δ 2 , partly colocalizes with clathrin - coated structures and binds directly to AP - 2 , in this case to the platform subdomain of the α appendage ( Kawasaki et al . , 2007 ) . Although DGK δ 2 is widely expressed , mRNA transcripts for the enzyme are not particularly abundant in brain ( Sakane et al . , 2002 ) . Therefore , at the synapse , this enzyme may not be recruited to presynaptic coated buds concomitantly with PIPKI γ 661 . Perhaps in different cell types , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and PtdOH production at clathrin - coated regions is managed by different enzymes associating with distinct sites on the AP - 2 appendages . Like PIPKI γ , the phosphoinositide polyphosphatase synaptojanin 1 is subject to alternative splicing ( Ramjaun and McPherson , 1996 ) . Somewhat unexpectedly , the ubiquitously expressed large - splice isoform , SJ170 , is present within clathrin - coated structures at the cell surface throughout the assembly cycle ( Perera et al . , 2006 ) . SJ170 also associates physically with AP - 2 ( Haffner et al . , 2000 ; Jha et al . , 2004 ) and , similar to PIPKI γ 661 , we mapped the principal interaction motif to a WXX [ FW ] X [ DE ] n motif within the C - terminal extension of SJ170 ( Jha et al . , 2004 ) . This type of interaction motif selectively engages the sandwich subdomain of the AP - 2 α appendage ( Mishra et al . , 2004 ; Ritter et al . , 2004 ; Walther et al . , 2004 ) . Thus , PIPKI γ 661 , DGK δ 2 and SJ170 can all associate directly with AP - 2 , albeit though different contact sites on the appendages ( Figure 5 . 2 ) . By binding to different surfaces of the α or β 2 appendage , the various enzymes that modulate PtdIns P metabolism at the growing bud can be subject to different regulatory inputs . Therefore , the α and β 2 appendages appear to operate as organizational scaffolds , in part to optimize the regional lipid environment necessary for clathrin - coat formation . Indeed , this seems to be a general requirement for efficient receptor internalization because β - arrestin 2 , a CLASP that promotes the uptake of stimulated G protein - 78 coupled receptors ( Lefkowitz and Shenoy , 2005 ; Marchese et al . , 2008 ) , also associates directly with DGK ( Nelson et al . , 2007 ) . β - arrestin 2 also binds physically to PIPKI in a PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - sensitive fashion ( Nelson et al . , 2008 ) . The ability of other CLASPs to engage PIPKIs is in accord with much data showing that , under certain experimental circumstances , internalization of discrete transmembrane cargo molecules continues in an AP - 2 gene - silenced background ( Hinrichsen et al . , 2003 ; Motley et al . , 2003 ; Huang et al . , 2004 ; Barriere et al . , 2006 ; Keyel et al . , 2006 ; Maurer and Cooper , 2006 ; Eden et al . , 2007 ) . 79 2 . 5 ADDITIONAL DATA Figure 2 . 16 : Crystal structure of AP - 2 β 2 appendage in complex with the human PIPKI γ 668 C terminus .

In addition to binding a variety of adaptors and accessory factors , the β 2 subunit binds clathrin and is central to the polymerization of clathrin into a lattice . Though it is clear that clathrin polymerization causes displacement of some β 2 appendage binding partners , there has been some dispute as to the precise location of clathrin binding . One proposal is that clathrin binding to the C - terminal β 2 appendage platform subdomain displaces adaptors that are retained within assembling vesicles through association with clathrin . β - arrestins are adaptors that recognize G protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) and target them to clathrin - coated pits through association with the AP - 2 β 2 appendage platform and clathrin . A β - arrestin 1 mutant , which engages coated structures in the absence of any GPCR stimulation , is 82 shown to colocalize with β 2 - YFP and clathrin even in the absence of an operational clathrin - binding sequence . These findings argue against β - arrestin binding to a site upon the β 2 appendage platform that is later obstructed by polymerized clathrin . Also , the Type I γ phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase ( PIPKI γ ) binds to the AP - 2 β 2 appendage sandwich subdomain and the focal adhesion protein talin and expressed PIPKI γ is only found to colocalize with talin in non - neuronal cells . This could indicate that the β 2 appendage sandwich subdomains in assembled clathrin lattices are obstructed by clathrin . These results are in agreement with a model in which clathrin assembles by binding the AP - 2 β 2 appendage sandwich subdomain . 3 . 2 INTRODUCTION Clathrin - mediated endocytosis is a process through which many nutrient and signaling receptors , ion channels , and even pathogens , are internalized from the cell surface and delivered to endosomes . The process requires the fine coordination of cargo selection , membrane invagination , and actin dynamics ( Conner and Schmid , 2003 ; Robinson , 2004 ; Edeling et al . , 2006b ; Kaksonen et al . , 2006 ) . At the plasma membrane , these diverse processes are managed , in part , by the AP - 2 heterotetramer . The brick - like AP - 2 core is composed of a small σ 2 subunit , the cargo - selective µ 2 subunit , along with the N - terminal trunks of two large chains , the α - and β 2 subunits ( Collins et al . , 2002 ) . Projecting off both α - and β 2 - subunit trunks , via flexible hinges , are bilobal appendages that contain binding sites for clathrin and numerous other endocytic proteins ( Robinson , 2004 ; Edeling et al . , 2006b ; Schmid and McMahon , 2007 ) . 83 The four assembled subunits permit AP - 2 to coordinate various aspects of clathrin - coat formation . The plasma membrane - enriched lipid phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) is engaged by both the α - and µ 2 subunits ( Gaidarov and Keen , 1999 ; Höning et al . , 2005 ) . YXXØ - type sorting signals ( as found in the transferrin receptor ) are bound directly by the µ 2 subunit ( Ohno et al . , 1995 ) while [ DE ] XXXL [ LIM ] dileucine signals are recognized by a functional hemicomplex of the α and σ 2 subunit ( Janvier et al . , 2003 ; Coleman et al . , 2005 ; Chaudhuri et al . , 2007 ) . Various assembly protein and clathrin associations are established through the α - and β 2 appendages ( Wang et al . , 1995 ; McPherson and Ritter , 2005 ; Traub , 2005 ; Edeling et al . , 2006b ; Schmid and McMahon , 2007 ) . The α appendage has two interaction surfaces , one each upon the platform and sandwich subdomains . The platform site can bind to DP [ WF ] and FXDXF interaction motifs ( Brett et al . , 2002 ; Praefcke et al . , 2004 ) , while the sandwich site engages the WXX [ FW ] X n [ DE ] motif ( Mishra et al . , 2004 ; Praefcke et al . , 2004 ; Ritter et al . , 2004 ; Walther et al . , 2004 ) . These short interaction sequences are typically positioned within tracts of intrinsically unstructured polypeptide , and proteins bearing the former class of motifs are typically involved in cargo selection and lattice polymerization . Proteins bearing the latter set generally include regulatory proteins such as AAK1 , cyclin G - dependent kinase ( GAK ) and the phosphoinositide polyphosphatase synaptojanin 1 ( Jha et al . , 2004 ; Praefcke et al . , 2004 ; Walther et al . , 2004 ) . Some of the regulatory proteins , like synaptojanin 1 , also contain platform binding sites , potentially allowing them to compete previously bound clathrin - associated sorting proteins ( CLASPs ) off AP - 2 ( Mishra et al . , 2004 ; Praefcke et al . , 2004 ) . Thus , the α appendage regulates the temporal organization of the developing clathrin lattice through binding sites that permit the recruitment of first lattice assembly and cargo 84 selective factors , followed by regulatory proteins that control bud formation and likely promote release of proteins from AP - 2 once their role in endocytosis is complete . Similar to the α appendage , the structurally related β 2 appendage also contains two interaction surfaces , one analogous to the α appendage - platform site , and one positioned on the opposite side from the cognate a appendage - sandwich site ( Edeling et al . , 2006a ; Schmid et al . , 2006 ) . The contact sites on the β 2 appendage do not appear to control accessory proteins in precisely the same manner as the hierarchical α appendage - binding sites . Biochemical studies suggest the β 2 appendage - platform site is largely dedicated to CLASPs , such as the β - arrestins , which concentrate G protein - coupled receptors ( GPCRs ) ( Kim and Benovic , 2002 ; Laporte et al . , 2002 ; Milano et al . , 2002 ) , the autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia ( ARH ) protein , which decodes the FXNPXY - type sorting signal ( He et al . , 2002 ; Mishra et al . , 2002b ) , and epsin 1 , which recognizes poly / multiubiquitinated cargo ( Barriere et al . , 2006 ; Hawryluk et al . , 2006 ) . These discrete classes of cargo internalization signal do not bind directly to AP - 2 . The β 2 appendage - sandwich site , along with a type I clathrin box in the β 2 - hinge , allows AP - 2 to polymerize clathrin and regulate eps15 positioning within the assembling lattice ( Cupers et al . , 1998 ; Owen et al . , 2000 ; Edeling et al . , 2006a ) , though the β 2 appendage - platform site has been suggested to be the clathrin binding site on this appendage ( Owen et al . , 2000 ; Schmid et al . , 2006 ) . Thus , the β 2 - subunit contains functionally distinct binding sites that could simultaneously allow privileged access of certain CLASPs to the lattice along with clathrin recruitment . Overall , AP - 2 acts as a master adaptor , binding to the plasma membrane , sorting YXXØ - and [ DE ] XXXL [ LIM ] - bearing cargo , and coordinating clathrin vesicle formation while simultaneously providing access for alternative types of cargo by scaffolding CLASPs . Accordingly , targeted gene disruption or mutation of AP - 2 µ 2 - or α - subunit genes is 85 homozygous lethal in mice ( Mitsunari et al . , 2005 ) , Drosophila ( Gonzalez - Gaitan and Jackle , 1997 ) and C . elegans ( Shim and Lee , 2000 ) . Structurally , β - arrestins contain an N - terminal bi - lobed arrestin fold that simultaneously binds phosphorylated GPCRs and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , and an unstructured C - terminus containing a type I clathrin box and the β 2 appendage - binding sequence ( Krupnick et al . , 1997a ; Gaidarov et al . , 1999 ; Laporte et al . , 2000 ; Han et al . , 2001 ) . GPCR activation , phosphorylation , and β - arrestin binding is intimately tied to receptor endocytosis because the β 2 appendage binding sequence is bound back on the arrestin fold , stabilizing the inactive state , but is released by β - arrestin recognition of phosphorylated GPCR cytosolic loops ( Edeling et al . , 2006a ; Burtey et al . , 2007 ) . The consensus β 2 - binding sequence [ DE ] n X 1 - 2 FXX [ FL ] XXXR binds to the β 2 platform as well as the β - arrestin core through the anchoring Phe / Arg residues ( Edeling et al . , 2006a ) , though an upstream Iso / Val ( X 1 - 2 position ) stabilizes the core interaction and mutation to Ala releases the C - terminus and constitutively targets β - arrestin to preformed clathrin coats ( Burtey et al . , 2007 ) . In this study I made use of the constitutively active IV → AA β - arrestin 1 mutant to examine the importance of clathrin binding to maintain β - arrestin within internalizing clathrin - coated structures . I find that that IV → AA β - arrestin 1 is constitutively targeted to clathrin structures at the cell surface in the absence of GPCR stimulation and that its presence there is unaffected by mutation of the clathrin box motif . Furthermore , clathrin box mutants disappear from the cell surface concomitantly with AP - 2 . The wildtype and clathrin binding deficient IV → AA β - arrestin 1 also mediates downregulation of the angiotensin receptor and colocalizes with angiotensin ligand on endosomes . I also examined the subcellular localization of the AP - 2 β 2 appendage sandwich subdomain - binding protein PIPKI γ ( Chapter 2 ) . Neither full length 86 PIPKI γ or a truncation mutant harboring the β 2 appendage binding site colocalizes with AP - 2 in vivo though full length PIPKI γ colocalizes with its other binding partner talin . These data support a model where clathrin assembles around the AP - 2 β 2 appendage sandwich subdomain , blocking this site but leaving the β 2 platform subdomain open . 3 . 3 RESULTS 3 . 3 . 1 Clathrin binding surface on the β 2 subunit appendage In addition to engaging ARH and β - arrestins , the β 2 - subunit appendage also binds physically to clathrin ( Owen et al . , 2000 ; Lundmark and Carlsson , 2002 ; Edeling et al . , 2006a ; Knuehl et al . , 2006 ; Schmid et al . , 2006 ) . Yet the precise molecular basis for this association is currently controversial . There is general agreement that by binding bivalently to the clathrin heavy chain , some β 2 - subunit partners could be controlled spatiotemporally as the extent of polymerized clathrin lattice increases ( Edeling et al . , 2006a ; Knuehl et al . , 2006 ; Schmid et al . , 2006 ; Schmid and McMahon , 2007 ; Ungewickell and Hinrichsen , 2007 ) . We recently mapped the clathrin binding surface to a site , including Tyr815 , on the N - terminal sandwich subdomain ( Edeling et al . , 2006a ) , and our prior results indicate that clathrin binding to the β 2 - appendage sandwich can displace interaction partners like eps15 and AP180 , which bind to the same site . Because clathrin trimers stoichiometrically outnumber AP - 1 / 2 in preparations of biochemically purified clathrin - coated vesicles ( Blondeau et al . , 2004 ; Girard et al . , 2005 ) , the excess of clathrin heavy chain terminal domains , which project into the interior of the assembled coat ( Musacchio et al . , 1999 ; 87 Edeling et al . , 2006b ) , can bind avidly to AP - 2 through the β 2 subunit . Indeed , we ( Edeling et al . , 2006a ) and others ( Tebar et al . , 1996 ) localize eps15 to only the periphery of clathrin - coated structures . Similar conclusions have been drawn for the mode of engagement of the monomeric GGA adaptor proteins and clathrin , where the C - terminal GAE domain of the GGAs only contains a sandwich subdomain ( Knuehl et al . , 2006 ) . Since activation of GPCRs leads to the rapid translocation of an activated GPCR ⋅β - arrestin complex to preexisting clathrin - coated structures at the cell surface ( Laporte et al . , 2000 ; Santini et al . , 2002 ; Scott et al . , 2002 ) and because ARH ( He et al . , 2002 ; Mishra et al . , 2002b ) and β - arrestins ( Kim and Benovic , 2002 ; Laporte et al . , 2002 ) specifically engage the platform subdomain of the β 2 appendage , we proposed that the β 2 platform interaction surface represents a relatively privileged binding site ( Mishra et al . , 2005 ; Brett and Traub , 2006 ; Edeling et al . , 2006a ) . Challenging these findings and calling our conclusions “misleading” , McMahon and colleagues assert that it is the platform subdomain , and not the sandwich site , that is the location of the second point of contact between the clathrin heavy chain and the β 2 ( and β 1 ) hinge + appendage ( Schmid et al . , 2006 ; Schmid and McMahon , 2007 ) . In this model , clathrin interference dislodges CLASPs like β - arrestin and ARH from the β 2 appendage but , because both these proteins also have an adjacent but separate clathrin binding sequence , the proteins would remain associated with assembling clathrin coats despite occupancy of the β 2 platform with a distal leg segment of the heavy chain ( Schmid et al . , 2006 ; Schmid and McMahon , 2007 ) . This is a chief feature of the “changing hubs” model formulated to account for the vectorial nature of the clathrin coat assembly process ( Schmid and McMahon , 2007 ) . Clearly then , these opposing models have importantly different implications for the molecular basis of ARH - and β - arrestin - mediated cargo capture within forming clathrin coats . 88 Figure 3 . 1 : Clathrin - binding deficient β - arrestin 1 associates with AP - 2 . HeLa SS6 cells stably expressing β 2 - YFP were transiently transfected with wild type ( WT ) tdRFP - β - arrestin 1 ( A ) , tdRFP - β - arrestin 1 with the IV → AA activating mutation ( B ) , or tdRFP - β - arrestin 1 ( IV → AA ) + clathrin box mutation LIEL → AAEA ( C ) or + clathrin box deletion ∆ LIELD ( D ) . Approximately 18 hours post - transfection cells were imaged by TIR - FM to selectively observe the ventral surface . Representative images show tdRFP - β - arrestin 1 ( left column ) , β 2 - YFP ( middle column ) , and merged ( right column ) signals . Note that despite a considerable cytosolic pool , there is near complete co - localization of β 2 - YFP puncta with the tdRFP - β - arrestin 1 ( IV → AA ) alone or with either clathrin box disruption . Scale bar = 10 µ m . 89 To attempt to distinguish between the two models , we utilized a mutant form of β - arrestin 1 . Wild - type β - arrestins remain diffusely cytosolic in the absence of GPCR stimulation ( Laporte et al . , 2000 ; Santini et al . , 2002 ; Scott et al . , 2002 ) ( Figure 3 . 1A ) by maintaining a basal , inactive conformation . Several closely spaced residues within the C - terminal [ DE ] n X 1 - 2 FXX [ FL ] XXXR motif interact with the major folded N - terminal region of β - arrestin , rigidifying the protein and attenuating the CLASPs ability to engage the assembling clathrin machinery ( Kim and Benovic , 2002 ; Gurevich and Gurevich , 2004 ; Edeling et al . , 2006a ; Burtey et al . , 2007 ) . In β - arrestin 1 , immediately preceding the proximal Phe388 of the β 2 platform binding motif are Ile386 and Val387 . Double substitution of these residues to Ala ( IV → AA ) results in constitutive association of β - arrestin 1 with clathrin - coated structures in the absence of any GPCR activation ( Burtey et al . , 2007 ) . If β - arrestins only remain associated with surface coated structures by switching to clathrin when assembling clathrin binds the AP - 2 β 2 subunit appendage , then deletion or mutation of the β - arrestin 1 clathrin box sequence 376 LIELD should prevent the IV → AA mutant from colocalizing extensively with clathrin - coated structures at the plasma membrane . Using TIR - FM to inspect the ventral surface of HeLa SS6 cells stably expressing β 2 - YFP , we confirm that tdRFP - β - arrestin 1 is soluble while a portion of the IV → AA mutant concentrates at preexisting , β 2 - subunit positive clathrin - coated structures ( Figure 3 . 1A and B ) ( Burtey et al . , 2007 ) . In the IV → AA background , the colocalization of neither a LIEL → AAEA substitution nor a ∆ LIELD mutant with coated structures at the plasma membrane marked by β 2 - YFP is obviously different from the protein containing an intact clathrin box ( Figure 3 . 1C and D ) . While 0 . 6 ± 0 . 3 % of AP - 2 structures colocalize with tdRFP - β - arrestin 1 , 99 . 1 ± 0 . 6 % of AP - 90 Figure 3 . 2 : Clathrin - binding deficient β - arrestin 1 dynamically associates with AP - 2 . HeLa SS6 cells stably expressing β 2 - YFP were transiently transfected with tdRFP - β - arrestin 1 ( IV → AA ) ( A - C ) or tdRFP - β - arrestin 1 ( IV → AA + ∆ LIELD ) ( D - F ) . Approximately 18 hours post - transfection cells were imaged by TIR - FM at one frame every five seconds . ( A ) Representative frames from the tdRFP - β - arrestin 1 ( IV → AA ) expressing cells . β - arrestin 1 ( left frame ) and β 2 - YFP ( middle frame ) show extensive co - localization ( right frame ) . ( B ) A sequence of frames at 25 second intervals shows the simultaneous disappearance of tdRFP - β - arrestin 1 ( IV → AA ) ( middle row ) and β 2 - YFP ( bottom row ) from the evanescent field . The spot is the same as that boxed in ( A ) . ( C ) A line drawn along the axis of the box in ( A ) was used to create a kymograph . tdRFP - β - arrestin 1 IV → AA ( left column ) and β 2 - YFP ( middle column ) leave the evanescent field together ( right column ) . ( D ) tdRFP - β - arrestin 1 ( IV → AA + ∆ LIELD ) expressing cells likewise show significant overlap with β 2 - YFP as in ( A ) . ( E ) The boxed spot in ( D ) containing tdRFP - β - arrestin 1 ( IV → AA + ∆ LIELD ) ( middle row ) and β 2 - YFP ( bottom row ) disappears from the field ( solid arrowhead ) at 100 seconds as a second spot containing both proteins appears ( open arrowhead ) . ( F ) A line drawn along the axis of the box in ( D ) was used to create a kymograph . tdRFP - β - arrestin 1 ( IV → AA + ∆ LIELD ) ( left column ) and β 2 - YFP ( middle column ) disappear together while the appearance of arrestin in the second spot is slightly preceded by β 2 - YFP . All horizontal scale bars = 10 µ m ( A , D ) , while vertical time bars = 60 seconds ( C , F ) . 91 2 - positive spots contain tdRFP - β - arrestin ( IV → AA ) . For the tdRFP - β - arrestin ( IV → AA + LIEL → AAEA ) and tdRFP - β - arrestin ( IV → AA + ∆ LIELD ) mutants , 95 ± 2 % and 89 ± 3 % of AP - 2 structures contain β - arrestin , respectively . There are several distinct classes of clathrin - coated structures on the ventral surface of HeLa SS6 cells ( Keyel et al . , 2004 ) and the IV → AA β - arrestin 1 mutants localize to all of these . Analysis of the dynamics of de novo - forming puncta reveals that , like the tdRFP - β - arrestin 1 ( IV → AA ) ( Figure 3 . 2A - C ) , the IV → AA  ∆ LIELD mutant concentrates at , and then disappears with , β 2 - YFP - tagged AP - 2 structures ( Figure 3 . 2D - F ) . We do not observe earlier loss of the IV → AA  ∆ LIELD tdRFP - β - arrestin 1 mutant from these patches that would indicate failure to switch to a strictly clathrin - dependent mode of association . Very similar results are obtained using BS - C - 1 cells stably expressing GFP - tagged clathrin light chain ( data not shown ) , a cell line that exhibits de novo coat formation almost exclusively ( Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ) . It is important to note that in these experiments , the activation of the β - arrestin 1 ( IV → AA ) mutant occurs in the absence of any GPCR ligand addition , but HeLa SS6 cells also do express endogenous β - arrestins . While there is currently some doubt that non - visual arrestins oligomerize at physiological concentrations ( Hanson et al . , 2008a ) , overexpressed β - arrestins can form multimers ( Storez et al . , 2005 ; Milano et al . , 2006 ) . Oligomerization requires inositol hexakisphosphate binding and pertains to the soluble form of β - arrestin , as the contact sites for dimer and tetramer assembly are located on the concave surface that engages an activated receptor ( Milano et al . , 2006 ; Hanson et al . , 2008a ; Hanson et al . , 2008b ) . Solution oligomers therefore do not bind to GPCRs , and exposure of the C - terminal region , which couples β - arrestins to the clathrin machinery , destabilizes oligomers ( Hanson et al . , 2008a ) . We thus believe it unlikely that hetero - oligomerization with endogenous β - arrestins accounts for the 92 Figure 3 . 3 : Clathrin - binding deficient β - arrestin 1 associates with clathrin - coated structures in the absence of endogenous β - arrestins . Wild - type and β - arrestin 1 / 2 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts were lysed and resolved by SDS - PAGE ( A , left ) and transferred to nitrocellulose ( A , right ) . Portions of the blots were probed with an anti - β - arrestin polyclonal antibody , anti - clathrin HC mAb TD . 1 and anti - β 1 / β 2 subunit mAb 100 / 1 , or anti - tubulin mAb E7 . Protein size markers noted in kDa . Alternatively , β - arrestin 1 / 2 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts were transiently transfected with tdRFP - β - arrestin 1 ( red ) wild type ( B ) , the tdRFP - β - arrestin 1 ( IV → AA ) activating mutation ( C ) , IV → AA + clathrin box mutation LIEL → AAEA ( D ) , or IV → AA + clathrin box deletion ∆ LIELD ( E ) . At 18 hours post - transfection cells were incubated with 25 µ g / mL Tf488 ( green ) on 4 ° C on ice for one hour to label transferrin receptor in clathrin - coated structures , then rapidly imaged at 17 ° C by TIR - FM . Under these conditions , transferrin is found both at clathrin coated structures on the cell surface and already in peripheral endosomes . Magnified insets are denoted by white boxes ; the IV → AA and IV → AA + clathrin box disruption β - arrestin mutants ( middle inset ) both co - localize with Tf488 ( top inset ) , as denoted by arrowheads . Scale bar = 10 µ m . 93 Figure 3 . 4 : Down - regulation of the type 1 angiotensin II receptor by both clathrin - binding deficient β - arrestins . HEK293 cells stably expressing FLAG - tagged type I angiotensin II receptor were transiently transfected with tdRFP - β - arrestin 1 ( IV → AA ) ( A ) or tdRFP - β - arrestin 1 ( IV → AA + ∆ LIELD ) ( B ) . Cells were starved for one hour in starvation medium and then stimulated with 100 nM angiotensin II conjugated to Alexa488 ( AngII , green ) for 0 , 5 or 20 minutes . Cells were washed , fixed , and examined by confocal microscopy . Representative images of medial focal planes are shown . Before stimulation , β - arrestin is largely diffuse in the cytosol but also present at the plasma membrane ( arrows ) or at a juxtanuclear location ( asterisks ) . After five minutes of stimulation , β - arrestin clusters with angiotensin II at the plasma membrane ( closed arrowheads ) , and on endosomes ( open arrowheads ) . At 20 minutes after stimulation , nearly all β - arrestin and angiotensin II co - localize on larger endosomes . Scale bar = 10 µ m . 94 association of the IV → AA + clathrin box mutants with surface clathrin - coated structures . Supporting this view is that transfection of the tdRFP - β - arrestin 1 ( IV → AA ) clathrin - binding mutants into β - arrestin 1 / 2 nullizygous fibroblasts ( Kohout et al . , 2001 ) still results in constitutive accumulation of the tagged β - arrestin at membrane puncta that are also positive for surface transferrin ( Figure 3 . 3 ) . Finally , like the β - arrestin 1 ( IV → AA ) mutant , the compound ( IV → AA + ∆ LIELD ) mutant translocates rapidly to the surface of angiotensin II - stimulated HEK cells stably expressing the type I angiotensin II receptor ( Figure 3 . 4 ) . At 5 min , both the β - arrestin mutants colocalize with fluorescent angiotensin II at cell - surface patches and peripheral endosomes while , after 20 min , both angiotensin II and β - arrestin 1 ( IV → AA + ∆ LIELD ) are found in larger , juxtanuclear endosomes , typical of a class B GPCR ( Hamdan et al . , 2007 ) . These results show that deletion of the β - arrestin clathrin box does not have a major negative affect on GPCR downregulation and are fully consistent with a doubly - mutated IV → AA + LIEF → AAEA β - arrestin 2 mutant clustering activated thyrotropin - releasing hormone receptors at AP - 2 - positive clathrin - coated structures and orchestrating endocytic uptake roughly equivalent to wild - type β - arrestin 2 at 10 min ( Burtey et al . , 2007 ) . We conclude that β - arrestin switching to a clathrin - dependent mode of association is not an obligate step during the formation of clathrin - coated vesicles , and that the [ DE ] n X 1 - 2 FXX [ FL ] XXXR binding surface upon the platform subdomain of the β 2 appendage does represent a privileged interaction site , as it can be rapidly accessed by β - arrestin in the face of ongoing endocytic activity . 95 3 . 3 . 2 Accessibility of the β 2 subunit appendage sandwich subdomain Having shown that binding partners of the AP - 2 β 2 appendage platform subdomain have privileged access to the growing bud and are not displaced by polymerized clathrin , we sought to show the opposite : that an AP - 2 binding partner that solely binds the β 2 appendage sandwich domain is displaced as clathrin polymerizes . PIPKI γ is the predominate PtdIns ( 4 ) P 5 - kinase in the brain and generates PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 for compensatory CME at nerve terminals ( Wenk et al . , 2001 ; Di Paolo et al . , 2004 ) . While its role in CME in non - neuronal cells is unknown , the PIPKI γ 661 isoform binds to AP - 2 through the β 2 appendage sandwich subdomain ( Chapter 2 ( Thieman et al . , 2009 ) ) . Its residency at endocytic structures on the cell surface may then be regulated by clathrin . To examine this , HeLa SS6 cells were transfected with monomeric Cherry ( mCherry ) conjugated PIPKI γ 661 and examined by immunofluorescence for AP - 2 ( Figure 3 . 5 top ) . PIPKI γ 661 is localized to the plasma membrane as seen by the strong ring of fluorescence at the cell edge from the out of focus side membranes . PIPKI γ 661 is found in large and small puncta , however these puncta do not colocalize with AP - 2 ( Figure 3 . 5 top ) . However AP - 2 and PIPKI γ 661 puncta were often found adjacent to each other ( arrowheads ) . In contrast , another PIPKI γ 661 binding partner , the focal adhesion protein talin ( Di Paolo et al . , 2002 ; Ling et al . , 2002 ) , colocalizes robustly at large and small PIPKI γ 661 puncta ( Figure 3 . 5 bottom , arrows ) . The vicinity of AP - 2 structures to the PIPKI γ 661 puncta could indicate that these kinase assemblies are excluded from assembling endocytic structures or that PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 generated at these talin - positive structures is diffusing and promoting clathrin assembly nearby . Observation of mCherry - PIPKI γ 661 over time in β 2 - YFP HeLa SS6 cells failed to show enrichment of PIPKI γ 661 at the early phases of AP - 2 accumulation ( data not shown ) . Similar 96 Figure 3 . 5 : PIPKI γ 661 localizes adjacent to AP - 2 on the ventral surface of HeLa cells . HeLa SS6 cells were transiently transfected with mCherry - PIPKI γ 661 ( red ) and processed for immunofluorescence at 18 hours post - transfection with monoclonal antibodies against AP - 2 α subunit ( top ) or talin ( bottom ) ( green ) . The ventral plasma membrane of cells was imaged by confocal microscopy . mCherry - PIPKI γ 661 localizes to individual puncta and larger structures that are frequently adjacent to AP - 2 ( arrowheads ) . There is extensive colocalization of mCherry - PIPKI γ 661 with talin ( arrows ) . Scalebars = 10 µ m . 97 results were obtained when using clathrin light chain - GFP expressing BS - C - 1 cells ( Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ) , or clathrin light chain - GFP expressing CHO cells ( Yim et al . , 2005 ) , although BS - C - 1 and CHO cells did have PIPKI γ 661 puncta that may correspond to talin - positive structures ( data not shown ) . As an alternative approach , CCSs in BS - C - 1 and CHO cells were depleted and reassembled by incubating cells in 1 . 5 % 1 - butanol for a few minutes to inhibit PtdOH production and as a result stimulation of PIPKI followed by washout to reassemble adaptors and clathrin . Staged depletion of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 also failed to recruit PIPKI γ 661 to nascent CCSs in these cells . The inability to detect PIPKI γ 661 at AP - 2 structures even transiently may indicate a greater concentration of binding - competent talin , whose binding sequence in PIPKI γ 661 overlaps with the AP - 2 - binding sequence ( de Pereda et al . , 2005 ) , or phosphorylation of Ser645 , inhibitory for AP - 2 binding ( Nakano - Kobayashi et al . , 2007 ) , by endogenous kinases in these cell lines . A final possibility is that the PIPKI γ 661 ⋅ AP - 2 interaction is of very low affinity . To circumvent this , a double and triple repeat of the AP - 2 binding sequence from PIPKI γ 661 ( residues 630 - 661 ) was expressed in frame with mCherry in HeLa cells ( Figure 3 . 6 ) . A single copy of the AP - 2 binding tract ( ( 630 - 661 ) x1 , ( Thieman et al . , 2009 ) ) failed to colocalize with AP - 2 like the full length kinase , but also failed to accumulate in puncta that may have colocalized with talin ( Figure 3 . 5 and 3 . 6 ) . Expression of GFP - PIPKI γ ( 460 - 661 ) in primary hippocampal neurons did not result in targeting to synaptic boutons any more than a binding - incompetent peptide , despite being able to inhibit FM4 - 64 uptake ( Nakano - Kobayashi et al . , 2007 ) . Interestingly , expression of the double ( ( 630 - 661 ) x2 ) or triple ( ( 630 - 661 ) x3 ) binding sequence also resulted in diffuse localization of the mCherry - peptide , but caused an increase in the size of AP - 2 structures ( Figure 3 . 7A ) and a decrease in the density of AP - 2 structures ( Figure 3 . 7B ) . The triple binding sequence with a critical Trp mutated ( ( 630 - 661 ) x3 W642A ) had an 98 Figure 3 . 6 : Overexpression of the PIPKI γ 661 C terminus disrupts the steady - state AP - 2 structure morphology . HeLa SS6 cells were transiently transfected with a plasmid encoding mCherry alone ( empty ) or with PIPKI γ residues ( 630 - 661 ) as a single ( x1 ) , double ( x2 ) or triple ( x3 ) insertion in frame , or as a triple sequence containing the W642A substitution ( x3 W642A ) ( competitor column ) . At approximately 18 hours post - transfection cells were processed for immunofluorescence with a monoclonal antibody against AP - 2 α subunit ( middle column ) . The ventral plasma membrane of cells was imaged by confocal microscopy . Cells expressing ( 630 - 661 ) x2 or x3 display an apparent enlargement of AP - 2 puncta . Scale bars = 10 µ m . 99 Figure 3 . 7 : Quantitation of AP - 2 morphology changes from PIPKI γ 661 C terminus overexpression . ( A ) AP - 2 structures on the ventral surface of HeLa cells prepared as in Figure 3 . 6 were measured for their surface area . Based on the size distribution of the global population of structures three bins were created : 0 - 0 . 065 µ m 2 , 0 . 065 - 0 . 41 µ m 2 , and 0 . 41 - 4 µ m 2 . In each condition , the percentage of AP - 2 structures falling into each bin from 30 cells was averaged . The ( 630 - 661 ) x2 and x3 expression vectors cause an increase in the percentage of AP - 2 structures in the large group and decrease in the smallest group .

Error bars represent standard error . 100 intermediary phenotype with increased AP - 2 sructure size but relatively normal AP - 2 density . An explanation for these results may be that even when present in multiple copies , this AP - 2 interaction motif is of sufficiently low enough affinity that it has a high on - off rate . It could still interfere with clathrin binding to the β 2 appendage sandwich site on AP - 2 and in doing so cause an expansion of AP - 2 on the plasma membrane from decreased clathrin - mediated budding . 3 . 4 DISCUSSION ARH and the β - arrestins differ significantly from eps15 and several other CLASPs and accessory factors in that they both display only a single AP - 2 binding determinant with an absolute selectivity for the platform subdomain of the β 2 appendage ( Laporte et al . , 2000 ; He et al . , 2002 ; Mishra et al . , 2002b ) . Substantial data attest to the critical and selective importance of the β 2 appendage in the initial recruitment of GPCR ⋅β - arrestin complexes to preexisting sites of clathrin assembly . The clathrin box is located within a flexible , unstructured C - terminal loop ( Milano et al . , 2002 ) , even in the basal β - arrestin conformation . Yet β - arrestins are cytosolic in the absence of GPCR activation ( Hamdan et al . , 2007 ) so , although the clathrin box is potentially accessible to the clathrin terminal domain , if the distal [ DE ] n X 1 - 2 FXX [ FL ] XXXR sequence is conformationally restrained , β - arrestins fail to associate appreciably with clathrin - coated structures . Similarly , when fused to GFP , the C - terminal region of β - arrestin 2 populates AP - 2 - positive clathrin structures at the cell surface but this colocalization is completely lost if the [ DE ] n X 1 - 2 FXX [ FL ] XXXR sequence is disrupted , even with an intact adjacent clathrin box 101 ( Schmid et al . , 2006 ) . Also , the β - arrestin 1 IVF → AAA triple mutant is not colocalized with AP - 2 at steady state , despite the conformation relaxation affected by the IV to AA substitution ( Burtey et al . , 2007 ) . Mutagenic inactivation of the AP - 2 binding sequence in β - arrestin 2 still allows translocation of this CLASP to agonist - stimulated GPCRs on the cell surface , but clustering at AP - 2 - positive puncta is lost , again despite an intact clathrin box ( Laporte et al . , 2000 ) . Indeed , bioluminescence resonance energy transfer studies show that β - arrestin binding to liganded GPCRs temporally precedes an AP - 2 β 2 appendage interaction ( Hamdan et al . , 2007 ) , and that mutation of the interaction surface on the β 2 platform subdomain prevents energy transfer to AP - 2 ( Hamdan et al . , 2007 ) . By contrast , even with an inactivating mutation or complete deletion of the clathrin box , β - arrestin 1 still targets to clathrin - coated structures ( Figures 3 . 1 – 3 . 4 ) . Altogether , this argues strongly that the [ DE ] n X 1 - 2 FXX [ FL ] XXXR sequence is the principal determinant governing initial linkage of GPCRs with the endocytic machinery ( Laporte et al . , 2000 ) . The binding affinity of ARH ( and β - arrestin ) for the β 2 - appendage is greater than its affinity for any other binding partner . ARH binds to the β 2 - appendage with a K D of ~ 1 µ M ( Mishra et al . , 2005 ) , compared with 22 µ M for a type I clathrin box LLDLD binding to clathrin ( Miele et al . , 2004 ) , 10 - 100 µ M for the Shc PTB domain binding to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( Zhou et al . , 1995 ) and 2 - 5 µ M for various PTB domains binding to FXNPXY peptides ( Li et al . , 1998 ; Howell et al . , 1999 ; Stolt et al . , 2003 ; Stolt et al . , 2005 ) . In a sequential hub model for clathrin - coated vesicle assembly , it is proposed that AP - 2 - dependent interactions are diminished as clathrin buds progress toward late - stage events ( Schmid et al . , 2006 ; Schmid and McMahon , 2007 ) . In fact , it is conjectured that ARH and β - arrestins only remain associated with deeply invaginated buds by interacting directly with clathrin heavy chains ( Schmid et al . , 2006 ) . Given 102 the tenfold difference in binding affinity for the β 2 appendage and the clathrin terminal domain , which is also subject to direct competition by numerous other CLASPs and accessory proteins that have tandemly repeated clathrin boxes and are massed at the bud site ( Robinson , 2004 ; Sorkin , 2004 ; Maldonado - Baez and Wendland , 2006 ) , the biological advantage of moving to an apparently lower affinity association ( at the clathrin hub ) is not obvious . The changing hub model was formulated , in part , to account for the inherent directionality of the clathrin - coat assembly process ( Schmid et al . , 2006 ; Schmid and McMahon , 2007 ) . Although our view is that CLASPs like ARH and β - arrestin , which associate physically with AP - 2 through the β 2 appendage , do not necessarily switch to a clathrin - dependent interaction mode in a temporally - defined manner , our observations certainly do not generally invalidate the model , which invokes changing degrees of freedom as a function of ongoing lattice assembly events . Nor do our findings indicate that the clathrin box in β - arrestin is functionally insignificant ( Krupnick et al . , 1997b ; Laporte et al . , 2000 ; Kim and Benovic , 2002 ; Santini et al . , 2002 ; Garuti et al . , 2005 ) . Rather , our data agree with several independent investigations showing the β - arrestin ⋅ AP - 2 interaction typically initiates clustering of GPCRs into clathrin - coated structures and simply preclude ARH and β - arrestins from the set of potential endocytic factors subject to displacement by assembling clathrin triskelia . Intriguingly , because of the clear functional redundancy between the adaptor β 1 and β 2 subunits , and because only a single pool of cytosolic clathrin is used to construct all clathrin - coats within the cell , utilization of neither the [ DE ] n X 1 - 2 FXX [ FL ] XXXR motif nor the clathrin box will ensure translocation of β - arrestin or ARH to only those AP - 2 and clathrin - containing structures positioned at the cell surface . However , both the β - arrestins ( Gaidarov et al . , 1999 ; Milano et al . , 2002 ) and ARH ( Mishra et al . , 2002b ) bind to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , a lipid concentrated in the inner leaflet of the plasma 103 membrane . The phenomenon of coincidence detection , involving simultaneous contacts with transmembrane cargo receptors , lipids , AP - 2 and then clathrin , likely provides the necessary selectivity . The striking translocation of the cytosolic pool of β - arrestin 1 upon angiotensin II application ( Figure 3 . 4 ) is a graphic demonstration of this avidity - based phenomenon . PIPKI γ 661 specifically binds to the AP - 2 β 2 appendage sandwich subdomain ( Chapter 2 ( Thieman et al . , 2009 ) ) along with other CLASPs eps15 and AP180 and clathrin itself ( Edeling et al . , 2006a ) . Ultrastructural localization of eps15 within clathrin lattices shows it is selectively found at the edge where clathrin is absent or not fully polymerized ( Tebar et al . , 1996 ; Edeling et al . , 2006a ) . Therefore clathrin may regulate positioning of sandwich binding partners during assembly . Consistent with this , PIPKI γ 661 does not colocalize with AP - 2 by confocal microscopy . PIPKI γ 661 instead colocalizes with another one of its binding partners talin ( Figure 3 . 5 ) . Talin localizes to focal contacts and activates integrins for inside - out signaling to promote focal adhesion formation ( Moser et al . , 2009 ) . Talin also recruits PIPKI γ 661 to generate PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in a positive feedback loop that promotes recruitment of other focal adhesion proteins including talin ( Di Paolo et al . , 2002 ; Ling et al . , 2002 ) . This exclusive colocalization of PIPKI γ 661 within talin could indicate a higher affinity for the talin binding site . Indeed , the dissociation constant for the PIPKI γ 661 ⋅ talin interaction is ~ 270 nM ( de Pereda et al . , 2005 ) compared with 22 µ M for PIPKI γ 661 ⋅ AP - 2 β 2 ( Kahlfeldt et al . , 2010 ) . Alternatively , few unoccupied β 2 appendages may make detection of PIPKI γ 661 at the edge of clathrin lattices difficult to detect . However immunofluorescence for eps15 in HeLa cells clearly shows its colocalization with AP - 2 ( data not shown , see Chapter 4 ) . Still , AP - 2 structures were frequently found adjacent to PIPKI γ 661 puncta suggesting some connection ( Figure 3 . 5 ) . Furthermore , although the isolated β 2 interaction peptide of PIPKI γ 661 did not colocalize with AP - 2 or talin , 104 it undoubtedly caused morphological changes to endocytic structures when present in multiple copies ( Figure 3 . 6 ) . Therefore , the inability to detect fluorescent proteins at clathrin lattices may not indicate their complete absence at these sites in our microscopy setup . These enlarged AP - 2 structures may accumulate from reduced endocytic ability as a result of interference of clathrin binding to the β 2 sandwich site . Overall , the β 2 - appendage of AP - 2 represents one hub within an intricate web of protein – protein interactions that promotes selective cargo endocytosis by facilitating initial CLASP recruitment . 105 4 . 0 THE ENDOCYTIC EFC - DOMAIN PROTEINS FCHO1 AND FCHO2 ARE NON - ESSENTIAL MODULATORS OF CLATHRIN ASSEMBLY 4 . 1 ABSTRACT The precise mechanistic basis for clathrin coat initiation at discrete sites on the plasma membrane is uncertain although phosphatidylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ) plays a key role . We find the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding FCHO1 / 2 proteins appear as pioneer components at clathrin bud sites , often preceding clathrin deposition . Although HeLa cells produce mRNA transcripts encoding FCHO1 and FCHO2 , only FCHO2 is detectable in endocytic clathrin - coated structures at steady state . RNAi - mediated depletion of FCHO2 in HeLa cells reduces , but does not eliminate , the number of clathrin - coated structures at the cell surface and slows , but does not prevent , cargo internalization . The remaining clathrin - coated structures appear aggregated or expanded . Simultaneous silencing of both FCHO1 and FCHO2 with siRNAs results in an analogous phenotype . This extent of large clathrin plaque expansion and / or clustering is infrequent in the control or mock - RNAi - silenced HeLa cells but prominent in MCF - 7 cells . Expressed FCHO2 can reduce the size of endocytic structures in both cell lines . The regular size and distribution of surface AP - 2 - and clathrin - positive puncta is reconstituted in FCHO2 - depleted HeLa cells by synchronous expression of either FCHO1 or FCHO2 . Together , our data indicate that FCHO1 / 2 are early coat components with somewhat overlapping functions that play 106 a significant , albeit non - essential , role in clathrin coat operation . There appears to be several parallel routes to sustain functional clathrin - mediated endocytosis . 4 . 2 INTRODUCTION Intracellular compartmentalization is a defining feature of all eukaryotic cells . The evolution of different internal compartments allowed specialization of biosynthetic and catabolic reactions within compositionally distinct , physically discrete subcellular organelles . Yet most membrane - bounded compartments depend on continual contact with other intracellular compartments to ensure proper long - term functioning . Exchange between different organelles typically relies on small , short - lived , tubulovesicular transport carriers , which generally cluster appropriate transmembrane protein cargo molecules and regulatory fusion factors into incipient buds while concurrently preventing efficient conveyance of inappropriate membrane components from the donor compartment ( Bonifacino and Glick , 2004 ) . A necessary intermediate in the budding process involves the deformation of an often planar or spherical donor membrane into a perpendicularly oriented cylindrical projection ( Zimmerberg and Kozlov , 2005 ) . Due to the universal importance of this membrane restructuring process , several structurally distinct families of soluble proteins can translocate to a bud site to couple membrane bending with vesicular transport . For example , along the endocytic pathway , the BAR ( Bin1 / amphiphysin / Rvs ) domain proteins amphiphysin , endophilin ( Ringstad et al . , 1999 ) and sorting nexin 9 ( Soulet et al . , 2005 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) participate in clathrin - mediated endocytosis . The BAR - PH ( pleckstrin homology ) domain protein APPL1 ( Li et al . , 2007 ; Zhu et al . , 2007 ) is positioned on very early peripheral endosomes ( Erdmann et al . , 2007 ; Schenck et 107 al . , 2008 ; Zoncu et al . , 2009 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) , while other sorting nexins with a PX ( ph One class of membrane - binding , crescent - shaped endocytic proteins are the EFC ( extended ox ) - BAR domain organization are found on maturing sorting endosomes ( Cullen , 2008 ) . Two common features of many of these membrane - associated proteins is the presence of a rigid crescent - shaped surface that closely apposes the bilayer and a propensity to oligomerize into rings or spirals . These properties seem to promote the physical forces necessary to constrain the bilayer for local bud restructuring ( Zimmerberg and Kozlov , 2005 ; Frost et al . , 2009 ) . FCH ( Fes / CIP4 homology ) ) domain proteins ( Suetsugu et al . , 2010 ) , which have alternatively been dubbed F - BAR proteins because of the overall structural similarity of the helical bundle EFC and BAR domain fold ( Frost et al . , 2009 ) . In all known EFC proteins , the EFC domain is positioned near the N terminus forming antiparallel α - helical homodimers but six discrete subfamilies are classified depending upon the presence of other modular domains within the polypeptide chain ( Heath and Insall , 2008 ; Suetsugu et al . , 2010 ) . The EFC domain proteins FCHO1 and FCHO2 ( FCH only protein 1 and 2 ) ( Katoh , 2004 ; Henne et al . , 2007 ) are characterized by a C - terminal µ homology domain ( µ HD ) , distantly related in primary sequence but with an analogous fold to the cargo - selective µ 2 subunit of the heterotetrameric AP - 2 clathrin adaptor ( Reider et al . , 2009 ) . This combination of an EFC domain with a µ HD is unique and phylogenetically conserved . Since all other known proteins or protein complexes that contain a µ HD ( AP - 1 to AP - 4 , COPI and stonin 1 / 2 ) handle cargo selection during the formation of transport vesicles ( Ohno et al . , 1995 ; Owen and Evans , 1998 ; McMahon and Mills , 2004 ; Maritzen et al . , 2010 ) , FCHO1 / 2 are candidate sorting adaptors . Indeed , the Saccharomyces cerevisiae orthologue , Syp1p , acts as a sorting adaptor for the transmembrane protein Mid2p at cortical actin patches ( Reider et al . , 2009 ; Stimpson et al . , 2009 ) , which correspond to clathrin - 108 dependent sorting stations at the cell surface . Here , we characterize the mammalian FCHO1 and FCHO2 proteins as integral endocytic components . 4 . 3 RESULTS 4 . 3 . 1 FCHO1 and FCHO2 are endocytic components Human FCHO1 ( KIAA0290 ; located on chromosome 19 ) and FCHO2 ( on chromosome 5 ) display ~ 50 % overall amino acid identity and a similar domain organization ( Figure 4 . 1A ) ( Katoh , 2004 ) . These paralogous proteins have orthologues in chordates , arthropods and nematodes ( Katoh , 2004 ) , as well as in unicellular eukaryotes ( Reider et al . , 2009 ; Stimpson et al . , 2009 ) . In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , Syp1p has an analogous architecture to FCHO1 / 2 despite limited ( < 20 % ) overall primary sequence identity ( Figure 4 . 1A ) . Phylogenetic dendrograms ( TreeFam TF328986 ) ( Ruan et al . , 2008 ) show that SGIP1 is more closely related to FCHO2 than to FCHO1 , but this protein , while containing a modular C - terminal µ HD , lacks the folded N - terminal helical EFC domain ( Figure 4 . 1A ) ( Uezu et al . , 2007 ) . RT - PCR analysis with gene - specific primers reveals that both FCHO1 and FCHO2 transcripts can be detected in HeLa cells , although the specific FCHO1 amplicon is weak ( Figure 4 . 1B ) . The presence of the appropriate FCHO1 PCR product is consistent with full - length cDNA clones ( CR597235 , CR620485 and CR625849 ) isolated from HeLa cells , and also with the identification of FCHO1 - and FCHO2 - derived peptides in proteomic analysis of HeLa cell extracts ( www . humanproteinpedia . org ) ( Beausoleil et al . , 2006 ) . Similar PCR products are found in the neuroblastoma - derived SH - SY5Y cell line ( Biedler et al . , 1978 ) , along with an appropriate 109 Figure 4 . 1 : FCHO1 and FCHO2 are endocytic proteins . ( A ) The muniscin family of Homo sapiens FCHO1 , FCHO2 and SGIP1 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Syp1p are shown schematically . The EFC domain is displayed in blue and µ homology domain in orange . Approximate domain boundary residue numbers are shown . ( B ) RT - PCR reactions with primers specific for a variety of endocytic proteins resolved on agarose gels from HeLa cell ( top ) and SH - SY5Y cell ( bottom ) lysates . The DNA ladder sizes are indicated at the left . Representative single confocal sections of the ventral membrane of HeLa SS6 cells transfected with GFP - FCHO1 ( C , E ) , tdRFP - FCHO2 ( E ) or immunolabeled for endogenous FCHO2 ( D ) and AP - 2 α ( C - E ) are shown . ( F ) A representative medial confocal section of GFP - FCHO1 transfected HeLa SS6 cells immunolabeled for LC3 . The vertical order of all insets is the same as the labels . Scalebar , 10 µ m . 110 PCR amplicon indicating the presence of the SGIP1 message ( Figure 4 . 1B ) . Although SGIP1 is reported to be neuron specific ( Trevaskis et al . , 2005 ; Uezu et al . , 2007 ) , ESTs derived from some non - neuronal tissues are available , the SGIP1 message is evident in SWISS 3T3 cells ( Stimpson et al . , 2009 ) , and a tryptic peptide from SGIP1 expressed in HeLa cells is reported in the Human Proteinpedia database . At steady state , both transfected FCHO1 ( Reider et al . , 2009 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) and SGIP1 ( Uezu et al . , 2007 ; Stimpson et al . , 2009 ) colocalize extensively with clathrin - coated structures , unlike several other EFC domain proteins ( CIP4 / FBP17 / PACSIN ) implicated in endocytosis ( Modregger et al . , 2000 ; Kamioka et al . , 2004 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . Consistent with the PCR results , using three different polyclonal antibodies that do recognize transfected FCHO1 , we cannot detect endogenous FCHO1 in HeLa cells by either immunoblot or immunofluorescence microscopy ( data not shown ) . However , at low relative levels of expression , ectopic GFP - FCHO1 is found scattered over the ventral surface in both diffraction - limited spots and in larger , long - lived patches positive for the clathrin adaptor AP - 2 ( Figure 4 . 1C , E ) . By contrast , both endogenous ( Figure 4 . 1D ) and expressed FCHO2 ( Figure 4 . 1E ) colocalize very well with AP - 2 . Co - expressed GFP - FCHO1 and tdRFP - FCHO2 populate common AP - 2 - positive puncta at the cell surface ( Figure 4 . 1E ) . In confocal X - Z projections , transfected FCHO1 or FCHO2 is present at AP - 2 - positive spots on both the upper and lower membrane surfaces , although enrichment at the ventral side is more marked ( Figure 4 . 2A ) . At moderate levels of expression , FCHO1 saturates discrete AP - 2 - positive structures with the exception of those at the periphery and the excess FCHO1 uniformly labels the plasma membrane ( Figure 4 . 1C ; middle cell ) , likely due to the lipid binding properties of the EFC domain ( Henne et al . , 2007 ) . At the highest levels of overexpression FCHO1 accumulates in 111 Figure 4 . 2 : FCHO1 and FCHO2 are endocytic proteins , continued .

The arrow indicates a region of clathrin lattice discontinuitiy while the arrowheads label deeply invaginated buds . Scalebars , 10 µ m for ( A ) , 100nm for ( B ) . 112 larger cytoplasmic puncta , which are not LC3 positive ( Figure 4 . 1F ) , indicating these are not autophagosome - encapsulated protein aggregates . Some of the core clathrin coat components are not colocalized with these ectopic structures ( data not shown ) . While heavily overexpressed GFP - FCHO1 accumulates at large intracellular foci ( Figure 4 . 1F ) ( Nakajima et al . , 2005 ) , we do not observe specific juxtanuclear localization of the protein at the trans - Golgi network ( Sakaushi et al . , 2007 ) . FCHO1 aggregation appears to be mediated by the µ HD with possible contribution from the central unstructured segment as truncation mutants lacking these regions do not form intracellular puncta ( data not shown ) . And unlike GFP - SGIP1 - transfected COS - 7 cells ( Uezu et al . , 2007 ) , intracellular tubules emanating from either large or small GFP - FCHO1 - labelled membrane structures are rarely observed in fixed HeLa cells ( Sakaushi et al . , 2007 ) . Even at high relative levels of expression , FCHO2 does not display a similar tendency to form larger aggregates revealing distinct protein biochemistry between FCHO1 and FCHO2 . Endogenous HeLa cell FCHO2 is selectively detected at assembled regions of planar clathrin lattice and rounded de novo forming coated buds by immunogold labeling and deep - etch electron microscopy ( Figure 4 . 2B ) . FCHO2 labeling is discernable principally around the perimeter of these structures on the ventral plasma membrane and only rarely in the center . This spatial dichotomy is not an artifact of poor antibody penetration into the assembled lattice as other coat constituents can be detected throughout the coat by this method ( Edeling et al . , 2006a ; Keyel et al . , 2006 ) . In some larger clathrin assemblies , FCHO2 appears to be positioned at geometric discontinuities within the polymeric coat ( arrow ) . The anti - FCHO2 antibodies do not decorate the domed portion of deeply contoured pits ( arrowheads ) . Like other established clathrin coat constituents , clustered GFP - FCHO1 in low - expressing cells exchanges rapidly ( t 1 / 2 = 12 . 8 ± 0 . 9 sec , average ± standard error , n = 33 ) with 113 Figure 4 . 3 : Dynamic exchange of FCHO1 and FCHO2 at CCSs . HeLa SS6 cells transfected with GFP - FCHO1 ( A ) or GFP - FCHO2 ( B ) were imaged continuously at 2s / frame and were bleached with a 405nm laser for 2s at time 0 while simultaneously imaging with a 488nm laser ( C ) . ( D ) The fluorescence intensity of individual FCHO1 / 2 spots present throughout the experiment were measured and plotted relative to the pre - bleach intensity . Curve - fitting was used to determine the time of half - maximal recovery , t 1 / 2 ( E ) , and percent of maximal recovery ( F ) . Asterisk indicates p < 0 . 05 . Error bars represent standard error . Suc , cells cultured in 0 . 45M sucrose . Scalebar , 10 µ m . 114 the soluble population in FRAP experiments ( Figure 4 . 3A , C ) . Interestingly , while GFP - FCHO2 exchanges similarly , it has a significantly faster recovery rate ( t 1 / 2 = 8 . 1 ± 0 . 9 sec , n = 33 , p < 0 . 05 ) and greater maximal recovery ( 88 ± 2 % versus 82 ± 2 % , p < 0 . 05 ) ( Figure 4 . 3D - F ) , suggesting that FCHO2 undergoes more rapid exchange with the reserve cytosolic pool and has a larger mobile fraction than FCHO1 . In parallel control experiments with 0 . 45 M extracellular sucrose , which halts clathrin coat protomer exchange activity ( Wu et al . , 2003 ; Hoffmann et al . , 2010 ) , both FCHO1 and FCHO2 are essentially static . These findings reiterate that FCHO1 and FCHO2 are dynamically interchanging constituents of surface clathrin - coated structures . 4 . 3 . 2 Chronology of FCHO1 / 2 association with endocytic structures BS - C - 1 cells ( Hopps et al . , 1963 ) differ from HeLa and most other cultured cells in the conspicuous uniformity of clathrin - coated structures at the cell surface ( Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ; Loerke et al . , 2009 ; Saffarian et al . , 2009 ) . Still , transfected tdRFP - FCHO1 targets to clathrin - coated structures in BS - C - 1 cells ( Figure 4 . 4A ) , restating that this endocytic protein is not a selective constituent of long - lived clathrin structures as opposed to the de novo - forming buds typical of BS - C - 1 cells ( Saffarian et al . , 2009 ) . To better understand the role of FCHO1 and FCHO2 in clathrin - coated vesicle formation , the temporal properties of individual clathrin - coated structures in FCHO1 - expressing cells were examined by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy ( TIR - FM ) . In BS - C - 1 cells stably expressing clathrin light chain - GFP , tdRFP - FCHO1 is present in nearly all clathrin - positive surface structures ( 94 % , Figure 4 . 4A ) . FCHO1 ( Figure 4 . 4B , D ) or FCHO2 ( not shown ) is often found preclustered at discrete regions of the plasma membrane prior to clathrin recruitment to these nascent , diffraction - limited bud sites , consistent with previous results ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) . 115 Figure 4 . 4 : FCHO proteins are early components of de novo forming CCVs . BS - C - 1 cells stably expressing GFP - clathrin light chain were transfected with tdRFP - FCHO1 ( A - C ) , or tdRFP - eps15 ( E ) and imaged by TIR - FM . ( A ) A transfected cell shows extensive colocalization of FCHO1 and clathrin at steady state . ( B ) The temporal appearance of FCHO1 relative to clathrin at an individual spot is shown . ( C ) Multiple recruitment profiles for FCHO1 are observed over time as represented by the Y ( y - axis ) - T ( x - axis ) kymograph . These spots appeared during image acquisition in the circular regions indicated in ( A ) . ‘F’ indicates only FCHO1 is present , ‘B’ indicates both FCHO1 and clathrin are present and ‘C’ indicates only clathrin is present . ( D ) The order of appearance / disappearance of FCHO1 and clathrin were manually scored for 120 spots . The percentage of observances for particular profiles using the same nomenclature as in ( C ) are indicated by numbers on the pie chart . ( E ) The recruitment of the FCHO1 / 2 binding partner tdRFP - eps15 to a single clathrin - coated structure is shown . This was the most typical recruitment profile similar to ( B ) for FCHO1 . Numbers below image sequences indicate seconds . Scalebar in A , 10 µ m . Timebar in C , 1 minute . 116 Analogous time - resolved TIR - FM imaging of BS - C - 1 cells expressing tdRFP - eps15 , a physical binding partner of FCHO1 and FCHO2 ( Reider et al . , 2009 ; Henne et al . , 2010 ) , shows that eps15 is also a pioneer component at emergent bud sites , similarly preceding the arrival of clathrin ( Figure 4 . 4E ) . This is clearly analogous to the temporal behavior of Syp1p and Ede1p ( the yeast eps15 orthologue ) at endocytic cortical actin patches ( Boettner et al . , 2009 ; Stimpson et al . , 2009 ) . Analyzing global translocation of FCHO1 to assembling structures we find a majority ( 40 . 8 % , Figure 4 . 4D ) exhibit recruitment profiles in which FCHO1 appears prior to clathrin , both proteins then colocalize at the assemblage for some time , and then FCHO1 exits prior to clathrin disappearing from the evanescent field ( Figure 4 . 4B ) . While various temporal behaviors are observed in BS - C - 1 cells , 76 . 3 % of examined structures display early recruitment of FCHO1 and 54 . 9 % show FCHO1 loss prior to clathrin disappearance ( Figure 4 . 3D ) ( Henne et al . , 2010 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . At individual buds , FCHO1 can appear 24 ± 3 seconds ( average ± standard error , n = 86 ) before clathrin and disappear 22 ± 4 seconds ( n = 66 ) prior to clathrin in structures with this behavior . Transfected tdRFP - FCHO2 does not display as noticeable an early arrival profile , perhaps reflecting the faster exchange dynamics . To verify that the FCHO1 - containing clathrin - coated structures are indeed functional , tdRFP - FCHO1 transiently transfected BS - C - 1 clathrin light chain - GFP cells were pulsed with fluorescent transferrin while illuminating with TIR - FM ( Figure 4 . 5A ) . Initially , transferrin is dispersed over the cell surface but quickly binds to clustered transferrin receptors by ~ 20 seconds . In these image sequences , tdRFP - FCHO1 molecules are already massed at incipient import sites at 10 seconds , while clathrin begins to accumulate around 30 seconds , approximately the same time the transferrin concentrates at the site . The transferrin - positive 117 Figure 4 . 5 : FCHO1 - containing CCSs are functional and CCVs contain detectable levels of FCHO1 . ( A ) During acquisition of a BS - C - 1 GFP - clathrin light chain cell expressing tdRFP - FCHO1 , transferrin - Alexa647 ( Tf , blue ) was added to the media at time point 0 and the progression of an individual clathrin spot is shown . ( B ) Rat brain fractions ( ~ 20 µg ) were resolved by SDS - PAGE and stained with Coomassie ( left ) or transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with antibodies to clathrin and various adaptors ( middle and right ) . Molecular weight marker standards in kiloDaltons are shown . Some FCHO1 degradation products in the cytosol fraction ( lane b ) are indicated by a yellow bracket . Numbers below image sequences indicate seconds . 118 clathrin - coated vesicle buds at about 130 seconds while FCHO1 dissipates ~ 10 seconds earlier . These kinetics of cargo sequestration and vesicle budding clearly indicate that the tdRFP - FCHO1 - labelled structures are functional for cargo endocytosis . Our data thus confirm that FCHO1 ( and FCHO2 ) are early arriving pioneer molecules at regions of the plasma membrane destined to become clathrin - coated vesicles ( Henne et al . , 2010 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . Because some tdRFP - FCHO1 puncta leave the evanescent field concurrently with punctate clathrin - containing structures ( Figure 4 . 4C , D ) , we evaluated whether FCHO1 is found in purified clathrin - coated vesicles . The Allen Brain Atlas ( www . mouse . brain - map . org ) shows extensive FCHO1 RNA message expression in mouse brain by in situ hybridization with an antisense riboprobe , and many FCHO1 EST sequences have been obtained from human , mouse and rat brain tissue . In rat brain homogenate , an endogenous ~ 100 - kDa FCHO1 band is identified on immunoblots with two affinity - purified anti - FCHO1 antibodies ( Figure 4 . 5B ) . Less of the intact form is found in a high - speed cytosolic fraction , but the protein is present in purified clathrin - coated vesicles ( Figure 4 . 4B ) , albeit not strongly enriched as other endocytic components , like AP180 and Huntington Interacting Protein 1 ( HIP1 ) ( Mishra et al . , 2001 ; Blondeau et al . , 2004 ; Thieman et al . , 2009 ) , along with AP - 2 and clathrin . A striking feature of these immunoblots is the extent of degradation of endogenous FCHO1 in brain cytosolic extracts . Considerable proteolysis is also apparent for full - length FCHO1 transiently expressed in HeLa cells ( Figure 4 . 17 ) ; the protein may be subject to rapid proteolytic turnover . FCHO2 is expressed at very low levels in brain and is not found in coated vesicles comparably with FCHO1 ( not shown ) . This agrees with recent findings ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) and , along with the differential aggregation of FCHO1 upon forced expression ( Figure 4 . 1F ) , suggests some separable properties for these apparently redundant paralogues . 119 4 . 3 . 3 FCHO1 / 2 regulate endocytic structure morphology on the ventral cell surface Compatible with the low abundance of the FCHO1 transcript and inability to detect endogenous protein , transfecting a pool of FCHO1 - targetting siRNA oligonucleotides into HeLa cells has no overt effect on AP - 2 distribution ( Figure 4 . 7B ) , discrepant with recent RNAi results in BS - C - 1 cells ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) . That the siRNA duplexes indeed silence the appropriate mRNA is plainly seen by the dramatic loss of GFP - FCHO1 expression ( Figure 4 . 6A - B ) . RNAi - mediated suppression of FCHO2 does , by contrast , have a significant effect on coat morphology ( Figure 4 . 7C , E , G ) . Both ectopic GFP - FCHO2 and endogenous FCHO2 are depleted upon RNAi and the efficiency of protein knockdown is high ( Figure 4 . 6A , C ) . Similar results are obtained with two independent FCHO2 transcript - targeting siRNAs ( Figure 4 . 7C , E ) . Despite the dramatic change in endocytic structures on the ventral cell surface , AP - 2 positive structures on the dorsal cell surface are minimally affected by FCHO2 knockdown as seen by X - Z projections ( Figure 4 . 7H ) . In silenced HeLa cells , an obvious change in the number and positioning of large abutting clathrin plaques occurs at the expense of the diffraction - limited population . In these cells , the average number of AP - 2 structures per 100 µm 2 drops from 62 ± 3 in mock cells to 34 ± 2 ( p < 0 . 05 ) in FCHO2 knocked - down cells ( Figure 4 . 7I ) . Coats on the ventral surface become heterogeneous , more clustered and irregular compared with the mock RNAi - treated cells . On average , the AP - 2 patches in FCHO2 and FCHO1 + FCHO2 knockdown cells increase in size ( Figure 4 . 7J ) . The average fluorescence intensity of AP - 2 positive clathrin - coated structures > 0 . 2 µm 2 increases by 9 % when FCHO2 is extinguished ( Figure 4 . 7C and data not shown ) . Together , this indicates that more AP - 2 molecules are present at these structures . The incidence of > 0 . 6 120 Figure 4 . 6 : RNAi silencing of FCHO1 and FCHO2 .

Alternatively cells grown on coverslips were treated with siRNA by the same method except that they were cotransfected with tdRFP and GFP - FCHO1 ( B ) or GFP - FCHO2 ( C ) during the second round of RNAi .

( K ) AP - 2 structures in mock and FCHO2 siRNA - treated cells were binned into 3 groups : roughly diffraction - limited and small ( < 0 . 2 µ m 2 ) , medium ( 0 . 2 - 0 . 6 µ m 2 ) , and large ( > 0 . 6 µ m 2 ) and compared . The percentage of total AP - 2 structures falling into each of the three groups ( left ) or percent of the total surface area of AP - 2 labeling contributed by each bin ( right ) were compared for mock and FCHO2 siRNA - treated cells . Percentage numbers are given below the graph . Asterisk , p < 0 . 05 . Error bars represent standard error . Scalebars in A and H 10 µ m . Scalebar in A inset , 2 µ m . 122 µ m 2 AP - 2 patches increases sixfold ( Figure 4 . 7K left ) and , strikingly , these large structures now account for > 30 % of the assembled AP - 2 at the bottom of FCHO2 - silenced cells ( Figure 4 . 7K , right ) . The smallest AP - 2 structures , < 0 . 2 µm 2 , contribute only half as much of the total area in FCHO2 knockdown cells , a decrease not fully accounted for by the drop in this population ( Figure 4 . 7K , left ) , implying that these structures are smaller in size as well . Also , there is little difference between FCHO2 or FCHO1 + FCHO2 siRNA - treated cells , affirming a very small pool of functional FCHO1 protein in these cells . The expanses of AP - 2 we observe on the ventral membrane of cells following FCHO1 / 2 silencing may represent clustering of individual CCSs or dilation of individual clathrin lattices . To try to differentiate between the two we performed deep - etch electron microscopy of adherent HeLa cell ventral membranes . The electron micrographs clearly show that the extent of clathrin polymerization is greater in FCHO2 siRNA treated cells ( Figure 4 . 8 ) . The surface area of individual CCSs is greater in knockdown cells than in mock treated cells . What is more , FCHO2 structure ( Henne et al . , 2007 ) and in vitro membrane tubulation assays ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) suggest that FCHO2 is involved in membrane bending at CCSs , yet we still detect shallow and highly curved clathrin coats . Also , small de novo forming clathrin structures are seen in both conditions . In reciprocal experiments , overexpression of GFP - FCHO1 or GFP - FCHO2 also causes changes in the morphology of endocytic structures on the ventral membrane of HeLa SS6 cells by light microscopy ( Figure 4 . 9A - C ) . The average size of AP - 2 structures is reduced from 0 . 197 ± 0 . 007 µ m 2 in GFP expressing cells to 0 . 114 ± 0 . 006 µ m 2 in GFP - FCHO1 expressing cells and 0 . 103 ± 0 . 004 µ m 2 in GFP - FCHO2 expressing cells ( n = 45 cells ) ( Figure 4 . 9D ) . The concentration of AP - 2 structures also increases from 63 ± 2 structures per 100 µ m 2 in GFP 123 Figure 4 . 8 : FCHO2 silencing causes expansion of ventral CCSs .

HeLa SS6 cells were transfected with GFP ( A ) , GFP - FCHO1 ( B ) or GFP - FCHO2 ( C ) ( left panels ) and prepared for immunofluorescence for AP - 2 α ( middle panels ) . A decrease in the size of AP - 2 structures ( D ) and an increase in the concentration of AP - 2 structures ( E ) is quantified and can be seen as a result of FCHO expression ( inset ) . An apparent decrease in fluorescence intensity ( F ) is also seen . Error bars represent standard error . Asterisk , p < 0 . 05 .

MCF - 7 cells were transfected with GFP - FCHO1 ( A ) , GFP - FCHO2 ( B ) , GFP - FCHO1 ( 1 - 610 ) ( C ) or GFP - FCHO1 ( 1 - 275 ) ( D ) and prepared for immunofluorescence with antibodies against AP - 2 α . GFP - FCHO1 and GFP - FCHO2 colocalize with AP - 2 and reduce the size of puncta relative to adjacent untransfected cells . GFP - FCHO1 ( 1 - 610 ) causes a similar phenotype but does no colocalize with AP - 2 while GFP - FCHO1 ( 1 - 275 ) neither changes AP - 2 morphology or colocalizes with the structures . 126 transfected control cells to 81 ± 3 or 77 ± 2 structures per µ m 2 in GFP - FCHO1 or FCHO2 expressing cells respectively ( Figure 4 . 9E ) . The average intensity of structures also falls in FCHO overexpressing cells ( Figure 4 . 9F ) . A substantial variability in CCS morphology and dynamic behavior at the plasma membrane of various cultured cell lines exists : this includes the diffraction - limited ( < 200 nm diameter ) , de novo forming CCSs in BS - C - 1 cells ( Ehrlich et al . , 2004 ; Loerke et al . , 2009 ) , and a combination of de novo forming and large ( > 500 nm ) , long - lived , non - terminal budding CCS in HeLa ( Keyel et al . , 2006 ; Saffarian et al . , 2009 ) and NIH 3T3 cells ( Taylor et al . , 2011 ) among others . The breast carcinoma cell line MCF - 7 ( Soule et al . , 1973 ) displays numerous , AP - 2 - positive puncta , rings and lines on the ventral plasma membrane that are quite large ( Figure 4 . 10 , untransfected cells ) when cultured under our conditions . Consistent with the results in HeLa cells but much more marked , GFP - FCHO1 and GFP - FCHO2 expression in these cells resulted in AP - 2 structures that were smaller and more uniform in size ( Figure 4 . 10A , B ) . Overall , FCHO1 / 2 play an important role in determining the number and size of clathrin - coated structures . 4 . 3 . 4 Clathrin - coated structures are dynamic and functional in the absence of FCHO2 Assembled CCSs contain a range of adaptors and accessory factors in addition to AP - 2 and clathrin ( Traub , 2005 ) and being an early arriving protein , FCHO2 may influence the positioning of some of these components . Steady - state components of normal endocytic clathrin coats , like eps15 , epsin 1 and Dab2 ( Keyel et al . , 2006 ) , are still present at enlarged lattices in FCHO2 - silenced HeLa cells ( Figure 4 . 11 ) . This indicates that although eps15 and eps15R bind directly to the FCHO1 / 2 µ HD ( Reider et al . , 2009 ; Henne et al . , 2010 ) , this association is not required for 127 Figure 4 . 11 : Adaptor content of CCSs in FCHO2 silenced cells . HeLa SS6 cells treated with two rounds of mock or FCHO2 pool siRNA were fixed and labeled with antibodies to Dab2 ( A ) , epsin 1 ( B ) , or eps15 ( C ) and AP . 6 anti - AP2 α ( A , C ) or X22 anti - clathrin heavy chain ( B ) . Scalebar , 10 µ m . 128 placement of eps15 / R in surface coats ; instead the capability of eps15 / R to interact with numerous other endocytic proteins probably assures incorporation into polymerizing lattice devoid of FCHO2 . We are unable to replicate the published penetrant FCHO1 / 2 RNAi phenotype of complete loss of endocytic clathrin coats in BS - C - 1 cells ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) despite obviously efficient silencing of FCHO2 in the whole cell population ( Figure 4 . 16A , F ) . To determine if these enlarged AP - 2 patches in HeLa cells are possibly arrested intermediates , we first conducted FRAP experiments with FCHO2 knocked - down cells ( Figure 4 . 12A ) . In mock - treated cells , AP - 2 recovers in bleached zones with a t 1 / 2 = 37 ± 6 s ( n = 33 ) ( Figure 4 . 12B , C ) . This is slower than previously published ( Wu et al . , 2003 ; Hinrichsen et al . , 2006 ) and is probably due to the fact that this stable cell line expresses low levels of the β 2 - YFP subunit that incorporates into < 10 % of AP - 2 molecules at steady state . Depleting FCHO2 does not significantly affect the return rate ( t 1 / 2 = 42 ± 4 s , n = 33 ) or the extent of recovery ( 83 ± 5 % compared with 78 ± 5 % for mock ) ( Figure 4 . 12D ) . Therefore , the AP - 2 in clathrin - coated structures at the surface exchanges with the reserve cytosolic pool at similar rates in either the presence or absence of FCHO2 and can likely rely on the cohort of endocytic proteins at assembled lattices for its targeting . Next , we examined the lifetime of AP - 2 positive structures on the ventral surface of HeLa cells in the presence or absence of FCHO2 . HeLa cells differ fundamentally from BS - C - 1 cells in that they contain numerous long - lived clathrin - coated structures termed patches or plaques ( Maupin and Pollard , 1983 ; Wu et al . , 2003 ; Keyel et al . , 2008 ; Saffarian et al . , 2009 ) ( Figure 4 . 12E ) . Ablation of FCHO2 significantly reduces the number of AP - 2 spots observed over a 10 - min period by ~ 60 % ( Figure 4 . 12E - G ) ; this is largely a result of a drop in the total 129 Figure 4 . 12 : Enlarged endocytic structures in FCHO2 knockdown cells have dynamic properties similar to control cells . ( A ) HeLa SS6 cells stably expressing AP - 2 β 2 - YFP were mock treated or treated with two rounds of FCHO2 siRNA and imaged by confocal microscopy . At time point zero , a 5 µ m circular region was bleached for 2 seconds and imaged continuously . ( B ) The fluorescence intensity of 33 spots within bleach regions per condition were averaged and plotted relative to pre - bleach intensity . The recovery curves were fitted and used to calculate the time of half - maximal recovery , t 1 / 2 ( C ) , and percent of maximal recovery ( D ) . ( E - F ) HeLa SS6 β 2 - YFP cells were treated as in ( A ) and imaged by TIRF microscopy . A three - pixel wide line ( red line ) was used to create an X - T kymograph from a 10 minute experiment . Both stable assemblies and transient structures ( arrowheads ) are observed . ( G ) The total number of AP - 2 spots in a 400 µ m 2 region over a 10 minute period were averaged for mock and FCHO2 knockdown cells ( n = 12 cells ) . Asterisk , p < 0 . 05 . All error bars represent standard error . Scalebars in A and E , 10 µ m . Timebar in F , 3 minutes . 130 number of structures / µ m 2 ( see Figure 4 . 7 ) . However both stable and short - lived endocytic structures are seen in both conditions . In S . cerevisiae , an overt general endocytic defect is not apparent in a syp1 ∆ strain ( Reider et al . , 2009 ; Stimpson et al . , 2009 ) . Likewise , the essentially normal exchange dynamics , coat lifetimes and CLASP deposition in FCHO2 - ( and FCHO1 and FCHO2 ) - depleted cells all suggest that the large clathrin assemblies are likely operational . Indeed , transferrin receptor is found populating AP - 2 structures in FCHO2 knockdown cells ( Figure 4 . 13A ) . Still , a fundamental functional distinction between large clathrin plaques and diffraction - limited clathrin buds has been proposed ( Saffarian et al . , 2009 ) . The transferrin receptor , a prototypical cargo receptor , is internalized through recognition of a YXXØ - type sorting signal within its cytosolic domain ( Jing et al . , 1990 ) by the µ 2 subunit of AP - 2 ( Ohno et al . , 1998 ; Owen and Evans , 1998 ) . The low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) receptor , by contrast , displays an FXNPXY sorting signal ( Chen et al . , 1990 ) recognized by the PTB domain CLASPs Dab2 and ARH ( He et al . , 2002 ; Keyel et al . , 2006 ; Maurer and Cooper , 2006 ) . As the FCHO1 / 2 µ HD can bind to Dab2 ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) , internalization of these two cargo molecules may differ in cells in which FCHO2 is extinguished . Following a 10 - min pulse of fluorescently labeled transferrin at 37°C , FCHO2 siRNA - treated HeLa cells show a modest but significant decrease in endocytosis ( 82 ± 2 % the level of mock - treated cells , p < 0 . 05 , n = 146 cells ) ( Figure 4 . 13B , D ) . Providing FCHO2 knocked - down cells with fluorescently labeled LDL continuously for 20 min at 37°C produces a similar result , with cells internalizing 81 ± 2 % the level of mock - treated cells ( p < 0 . 05 , n = 144 cells ) ( Figure 4 . 13C , D ) . These data show that while FCHO2 silenced cells have a grossly altered AP - 2 and clathrin distribution , only a subtle effect is observed on bulk endocytosis . In addition , 131 Figure 4 . 13 : Ablation of FCHO2 causes a slight inhibition of endocytosis . ( A ) Mock and FCHO2 siRNA - treated HeLa SS6 cells were incubated on ice for one hour with fluorescent transferrin ( Tf , red ) and then prepared for immunofluorescence of AP - 2 ( green ) . Ligand - bound transferrin receptor colocalizes with AP - 2 in both conditions . In separate experiments , mock and FCHO2 siRNA - treated HeLa SS6 cells were incubated in the continuous presence of fluorescent Tf for 10 minutes ( B ) or the continuous presence of fluorescent low density lipoprotein particles ( LDL ) for 20 minutes ( C ) at 37 ° C and then processed for AP - 2 immunofluorescence . Representative confocal sections of the ventral cell membrane ( AP - 2 ) and maximum Z - projections of the entire cell volume ( ligand ) are shown . ( D ) Quantitation shows a ~ 20 % reduction of internalized Tf and LDL following FCHO2 kockdown . Asterisk , p < 0 . 05 . Error bars represent standard error . Scalebar , 10 µ m . 132 transmembrane cargo recognized by the core adaptor AP - 2 and cargo recognized by the CLASPs Dab2 and ARH are equally affected suggesting a general retardation in the kinetics of uptake . 4 . 3 . 5 Molecular dissection of FCHO1 / 2 in its regulation of clathrin - coated structures The FCHO2 knockdown phenotype in HeLa cells is obtained with two independent siRNA preparations , but to confirm that this is not due to off - target effects , we performed rescue experiments by expressing GFP - FCHO1 , tdRFP - FCHO2 , or various truncation / chimera constructs ( Figures 4 . 14A and 4 . 15 ) . Cotransfecting cells with siRNA and GFP produces the typical altered morphology of more sparsely distributed AP - 2 - positive structures that are larger with brighter apparent fluorescence . By contrast , cotransfection with full - length GFP - FCHO1 or tdRFP - FCHO2 restores the number and more regular size of AP - 2 structures ( Figures 4 . 14A and 4 . 15 ) . Despite a variation in the mouse FCHO2 nucleotides surrounding the siRNA target sequence relative to human FCHO2 , this murine transgene is still partially silenced ( Figure 4 . 15 ) . This may explain the lower rescue efficiency observed ( Figure 4 . 14C ) . These results validate that the morphological phenotype is specific to loss of FCHO2 , and that FCHO1 and FCHO2 are functionally redundant in this aspect of their operation . Tellingly , our failure to abrogate completely clathrin - mediated endocytosis upon FCHO1 + FCHO2 RNAi ( Figure 4 . 16 ) is not restricted to just HeLa cells . In the human fibrosarcoma cell line HT - 1080 ( Rasheed et al . , 1974 ) and the breast carcinoma MCF - 7 ( Soule et al . , 1973 ) fluorescent transferrin is transported from the cell surface to endosomes despite effective silencing of the FCHO2 mRNA and dramatic loss of the protein ( Figure 4 . 16B - F ) . FCHO1 + 2 - silenced HT - 1080 cells display a less prominent change in the arrangement of surface clathrin structures than knocked - down HeLa cells but the MCF - 7 cells show large clustered clathrin - and 133 Figure 4 . 14 : Rescue of the FCHO2 knockdown phenotype . ( A ) HeLa SS6 cells were treated with two rounds of mock or single FCHO2 siRNA and on the second round were cotransfected with various GFP or tdRFP plasmids . Cells were prepared for immunofluorescence of AP - 2 and representative confocal images of the ventral membrane of plasmid expressing cells are shown . ( B ) Random fields of FCHO2 siRNA - treated and GFP or tdRFP expressing cells were captured and the plasmid was scored for its ability to restore the wildtype distribution of AP - 2 as defined by spot concentration and size . Constructs tested include GFP ( n = 101 cells ) , GFP - FCHO1 ( full length human 1 - 889 , n = 68 cells ) , GFP - FCHO1 ( 1 - 610 ) ( n = 63 cells ) , GFP - FCHO1 ( 1 - 275 ) ( n = 63 cells ) , GFP - ENTH - µHD ( epsin1 ENTH + FCHO1 ( 276 - 889 ) , n = 81 cells ) , GFP - ENTH - F1linker ( epsin1 ENTH + FCHO1 ( 276 - 610 ) , n = 90 cells ) , GFP - ENTH ( n = 72 cells ) , GFP - µ HD ( FCHO1 ( 610 - 889 ) ( n = 65 cells ) , GFP - ENTH ( L6Q ) - µHD ( n = 103 cells ) , tdRFP ( n = 59 cells ) , tdRFP - FCHO2 ( full length mouse 1 - 809 , n = 96 cells ) , tdRFP - FCHO2 ( 1 - 525 ) ( n = 95 cells ) , tdRFP - FCHO2 ( 1 - 302 ) ( n = 64 cells ) . Error bars represent standard error . 134 Figure 4 . 15 : Biochemical confirmation of FCHO2 knockdown and rescue . Cells treated as in Figure 4 . 14 were lysed in sample buffer and resolved by SDS - PAGE . After transferring to nitrocellulose , portions of the blot were probed with antibodies against FCHO2 , GFP , or tubulin . Note the partial silencing of tdRFP - FCHO2 . Positions of molecular weight standards ( in kDa ) are shown on the left . 135 Figure 4 . 16 : Survey of FCHO1 / 2 knockdown in a variety of mammalian cell lines . BS - C - 1 cells stably expressing GFP - clathrin light chain ( CLC ) ( A ) , human fibrosarcoma HT - 1080 cells ( B ) and human breast adenocarcinoma MCF - 7 cells ( D ) were mock treated or treated with two rounds of FCHO1 and FCHO2 pool siRNA . HT - 1080 ( C ) and MCF - 7 cells ( E ) were incubated for 10 minutes at 37 ° C in the continuous presence of 25 µ g / mL Tf , washed , and all cells were fixed and prepared for immunofluorescence with antibodies against AP - 2 α ( A , B ) or clathrin heavy chain ( D ) . ( F ) BS - C - 1 GFP - CLC , HT - 1080 and MCF - 7 cells were treated as above with either FCHO1 and FCHO2 pool siRNA ( FCHO1 + 2p ) , FCHO1 pool and FCHO2 single siRNA ( FCHO1 + 2s ) , FCHO1 pool siRNA ( FCHO1 ) or FCHO2 pool siRNA ( FCHO2p ) , lysed in sample buffer and resolved by SDS - PAGE . After transferring to nitrocellulose , portions of the blot were probed with TD . 1 anti - clathrin heavy chain , GD / 1 anti - AP1 / 2 β 1 / β 2 subunits , anti - FCHO2 , and anti - β - tubulin antibodies . 136 Figure 4 . 17 : Endocytic protein composition of cell lines examined . Equal concentrations ( ~ 70 µ g ) of untreated HeLa SS6 , MCF - 7 and HT - 1080 lysates were resolved by SDS - PAGE , transferred to nitrocellulose and probed with antibodies against various clathrin coat components . The extra lane in the FCHO1 immunoblot is from HeLa cells transiently transfected with GFP - FCHO1 as a positive control . The bracket is to show where the endogenous FCHO1 band would be expected . 137 AP - 2 - positive patches in the absence of FCHO1 + 2 RNAi ( Figure 4 . 16D ) . Interestingly , this morphological alteration is not due to a lack of expression of FCHO2 protein although it resembles strongly the phenotype that ensues extinguishing these proteins in HeLa cells . A431 squamous carcinoma cells similarly contain large clustered , often ring - like clathrin assemblages on the ventral surface ( Hawryluk et al . , 2006 ) and express moderate FCHO2 mRNA transcript levels ( www . proteinatlas . org ) . Dual transfection of MCF - 7 cells with FCHO1 and FCHO2 silencing siRNAs does not dramatically alter the morphology of endocytic clathrin structures on the bottom surface of these cells . These results indicate that alone the FCHO1 and / or FCHO2 protein concentration is not the only regulator of clathrin - coated structure aggregation and patch size . I suspect that the relatively mild ( HT - 1080 ) or nonexistent ( MCF - 7 ) phenotype associated with FCHO1 + 2 knockdown compared with the phenotype in HeLa cells may reflect variations in FCHO1 / 2 binding partner expression in these cell lines . For instance , in MCF - 7 , intersectin and Dab2 are barely detectable and in HT - 1080 cells they are a fraction of the expression level in HeLa cells ( Figure 4 . 17 ) . In contrast , the levels of FCHO2 and its other binding partners eps15 / R are quite similar ( Figure 4 . 17 ) . The rescue assay allowed us to further probe the structural properties of FCHO1 / 2 necessary for steady - state endocytic site morphology . While the FCHO1 EFC domain ( residues 1 - 275 , Figure 4 . 1A ) alone is not capable of reversing the FCHO2 knockdown phenotype , unexpectedly the EFC and unstructured linker ( residues 1 - 610 ) do restore cells to a phenotype similar to the normal AP - 2 distribution , even though this truncated protein is generally not targeted stably to AP - 2 structures at steady state ( Figure 4 . 14 ) . The same is observed for the FCHO2 EFC domain ( 1 - 302 ) and FCHO2 EFC and unstructured linker ( 1 - 525 ) ( Figure 4 . 14B ) . This suggests that the µ HD ( residues 610 - 889 in FCHO1 or 527 - 810 in FCHO2 ) plays an 138 important role in retaining FCHO1 / 2 at AP - 2 - positive structures . These data also indicate that a region within the unstructured linker is important for proper maintenance of AP - 2 / clathrin bud site morphology . In fact , the ability of FCHO1 to reduce the size of large steady - state endocytic structures in MCF - 7 cells is also dependent on the unstructured linker but not the µ HD ( Figure 4 . 10A , C , D ) . This is further exemplified by reconstituting FCHO2 - silenced HeLa cells with a chimeric protein composed of the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - binding epsin 1 ENTH ( epsin N - terminal homology ) domain fused in frame to the unstructured linker and µ HD ( residues 276 - 889 ) of FCHO1 ( ENTH - µ HD ; Figure 4 . 12A , B ) . Truncating this construct prior to the µ HD still allows rescue of surface clathrin morphology to the same extent ( Figure 4 . 14B ) . Some evidence suggests that the epsin 1 ENTH domain promotes membrane deformation / tubulation by inserting an amphipathic α helix , ordered around the PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 head group , into the bilayer ( Ford et al . , 2002 ) . If plasma membrane curvature generated by the FCHO1 / 2 EFC domain is important for the steady - state distribution of AP - 2 , this property of the ENTH domain could explain the ability of this chimera to rescue . However mutation of Leu6 on the ENTH amphipathic α helix , a residue important for in vitro tubulation but not PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - rich membrane binding ( Ford et al . , 2002 ) , did not abrogate rescue of FCHO2 knockdown ( GFP - ENTH ( L6Q ) - µ HD , Figure 4 . 14B ) . A caveat of these data is that while rescue of morphology is assessed , function is not , such that these ENTH and truncation chimeras may not rescue protein exchange or wild type levels of endocytosis . 139 4 . 4 DISCUSSION FCHO1 / 2 are early - arriving elements of the endocytic clathrin coat machinery . The steady state positioning of these proteins is a manifestation of the inherent affinities for PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , eps15 / R , intersectin and Dab2 ( Reider et al . , 2009 ; Henne et al . , 2010 ) and , in the case of FCHO1 , the AP - 2 α appendage ( unpublished observation ) . Unlike other EFC domain proteins tentatively linked to clathrin - mediated endocytosis including Toca1 ( Bu et al . , 2010 ) , FBP17 ( Kamioka et al . , 2004 ) , CIP4 ( Feng et al . , 2010 ) and PACSINs ( Qualmann and Kelly , 2000 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) , the muniscins are undoubtedly components that govern the positioning and operation of coated structures . Here we demonstrate that FCHO1 and FCHO2 play a role in determing the number of CCSs in some cell types , regulate the size of flat clathrin lattices on the ventral plasma membrane , and have separable properties from each other that may differentiate their precise functions in vivo . FCHO1 / 2 are argued to be master levers of CME by remodeling the initial membrane patch and recruiting eps15 and intersectin prior to AP - 2 ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) . Generally , the expression levels of FCHO1 / 2 do impact the number of CCSs , at least in certain cell types . There was an apparent loss of structures upon FCHO2 knockdown and increase in structures on FCHO1 / 2 expression in HeLa cells . Also , FCHO1 / 2 expression in MCF - 7 cells appeared to increase the number of endocytic structures perhaps as a result of breaking up the large continuous network of AP - 2 staining . However , at most the loss of structures from FCHO2 knockdown was only ~ 50 % and certainly not a complete removal despite complete knockdown . Furthermore we and others ( Henne et al . , 2010 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) have shown that FCHO1 / 2 and interacting partner eps15 are clearly early components of de novo forming CCSs , often appearing before the onset of AP - 2 and clathrin , a behavior not known for any other components 140 of clathrin assemblies . This positioning is optimal for initiating assembly . While our data do support a clear role in coat initiation , they argue that muniscin - mediated regulation is more complex than a binary actuator of clathrin nucleation . We believe that FCHO1 / 2 are not absolutely required for initiation of CME for the following reasons : 1 . Depletion of FCHO2 does not alter the ability of AP - 2 to exchange with AP - 2 molecules in the cytosol ( Figure 4 . 12 ) . In the model proposed earlier ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) , AP - 2 is tethered by FCHO1 / 2 through eps15 / intersectin so that depletion of the FCHO1 / 2 would certainly hinder AP - 2s ability to target to the membrane . In assembled clathrin lattices , other factors present likely allow for exchange . 2 . Although the total number of AP - 2 structures forming at the surface is reduced in FCHO2 knockdown cells , there are still populations of short and long - lived endocytic structures indicating that FCHO1 / 2 do not selectively regulate a subset of endocytic structures ( Figure 4 . 12 ) . 3 . Endocytosis of transferrin and LDL particles is reduced in knockdown cells , consistent with point 2 , but this reduction is modest ( ~ 20 % ) ( Figure 4 . 13 and 4 . 16 ) . The remaining structures are competent for endocytosis . 4 . Invaginating clathrin assemblies are still observed in FCHO2 knockdown cells ( Figure 4 . 8 ) . Clathrin can still stabilize curvature induced by itself or other EFC or BAR domain proteins or possibly by epsin 1 . 5 . The adaptor content of CCSs is not drastically altered in the absence of FCHO2 ( Figure 4 . 11 ) . 6 . A multiparametric high - throughput siRNA screen of proteins to determine their involvement in endocytosis placed FCHO1 and 2 in groups for their role in endosome positioning , not modulation of Tf or EGF endocytosis ( Collinet et al . , 2010 ) . Endosomes were more peripheral for FCHO2 knockdown similar to what we saw ( Figure 4 . 13 ) , and could be a result of a small reduction in uptake . 7 . In yeast , the FCHO1 / 2 orthologue Syp1p is not required for endocytosis ( Stimpson et al . , 2009 ) . 141 An important question is whether or not early sculpting of the bud site by FCHO proteins prior to assembly of clathrin is a prerequisite for clathrin - coated vesicle formation as proposed ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) ? This obviously pertains more to de novo buds on the scale of 100 - 200 nm diameters than large flat clathrin lattices . In the HeLa SS6 cells we use , knockdown of clathrin results in patches of AP - 2 that are invariably flat ( Hinrichsen et al . , 2006 ) . Presumably FCHO2 is present but is not inducing curvature . In human skin fibroblasts , staged reassembly of clathrin - coated structures by hypotonic shock and recovery followed by deep - etch electron microscopy showed that early clathrin - coated structures are flat and only round up at later time points ( Larkin et al . , 1986 ) . Finally , rescue experiments with the ENTH - µ HD chimera , particularly the amphipathic helix mutant deficient for in vitro tubulation , was able to rescue CCS size and placement suggesting that EFC domain - generated membrane curvature was not necessary for steady state morphology of flat clathrin lattices present in these cells . Because it is reasonable to suggest that the ability of FCHO1 / 2 to promote membrane curvature is regulated by its concentration at bud sites and its oligomeric state , it seems that initially FCHO1 and FCHO2 function primarily in coat assembly rather than for membrane bending but could function in such a role at later stages during their peak concentrations . A second major finding from this study is that FCHO1 and FCHO2 regulate the size of clathrin assemblies on the ventral membrane of cultured cells . This likely arises from the fact that expressed FCHO1 and FCHO2 are more highly enriched at AP - 2 structures on the ventral membrane rather than the dorsal membrane ( Figure 4 . 2A ) and FCHO2 knockdown has a greater effect on the distribution and morphology of ventral CCSs ( Figure 4 . 7H ) . Reduction of FCHO1 / 2 protein levels increases CCS size in some of the cell types examined reciprocal to the effect on CCS number , while increasing FCHO1 / 2 expression reduces CCS size . Changes in clathrin 142 lattice size could happen by either promoting or limiting clathrin polymerization at lattice edges or through increased or decreased non - terminal budding which may occur at the edges of these structures ( Rappoport et al . , 2004 ; Traub , 2009 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . Consistent with a role in regulating lattice size , FCHO2 is found at the periphery of de novo and long - lived ventral CCSs ( Figure 4 . 2B ) . These observations have led us to propose two , not mutually exclusive models . In one model FCHO1 and FCHO2 act as scaffolds to properly arrange pioneer constituents to promote swift polymerization of de novo coated buds . As assembly continues , the peripheral ring of FCHO1 / 2 might allow ordered assembly of AP - 2 , other CLASPs and regulatory factors in the growing coat coupled to membrane deformation through its EFC domain . At pre - existing clathrin lattices , FCHO1 / 2 may promote CCV budding from the edges again coupling ordered assembly through eps15 / R and intersectin and membrane bending . In the absence of FCHO2 , de novo buds could still form , but may take longer , hence slowed uptake . Slowed or reduced budding from the edges of long - lived clathrin lattices could yield expanded CCSs if the balance between assembly and removal is skewed . Or moderately slowed uptake may represent the increased diffusion time of transmembrane cargo required to encounter the larger plaques as they are less abundant on the plasma membrane . Conversely , higher concentrations of FCHO1 / 2 could promote nucleation of more de novo structures or promote greater budding from lattices . FCHO2 is positioned at the edges of flat clathrin - lattices and de novo buds ( Figure 4 . 2B ) similar to eps15 ( Tebar et al . , 1996 ; Edeling et al . , 2006a ) . The interactions of FCHO2 with eps15 and intersectin through the µ HD and also the occupancy of the eps15 ( Edeling et al . , 2006a ) and intersectin ( Pechstein et al . , 2010a ) binding sites on the AP - 2 β 2 appendage sandwich subdomain by assembled clathrin may dictate the positioning of these proteins . At the 143 edges of the lattices where clathrin assembly is incomplete , eps15 and intersectin could promote AP - 2 and clathrin assembly perhaps in concert with FCHO2 induced membrane invagination . Removal of FCHO1 / 2 and eps15 from de novo structures just prior to budding ( Figure 4 . 4 and ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) , and the absence of detectable levels of FCHO2 on deeply invaginated buds ( Figure 4 . 2B ) ) could be accomplished by a combination of occupancy of all AP - 2 molecules by clathrin with no further AP - 2 deposition and membrane curvature of the bud that begins to exceed the intrinsic curvature of the FCHO EFC domain , thus weakening its interaction with the membrane . The fact that FCHO1 / 2 typically depart from the assemblage before the final budding event could explain how overexpression changes the dynamics of clathrin - coated structures . Increased FCHO1 or - 2 concentration by forced expression changes the equilibrium and spots become longer lived and more static in BS - C - 1 cells ( data not shown ) . This argues that exit of the majority of FCHO1 / 2 is required for rapid budding , perhaps because the oligomer must be disassembled . Yet a precise role of scaffolding assembly early and membrane curvature at a later time is hard to reconcile with the capability of the ENTH - µ HD ( wildtype and L6Q , membrane bending - deficient ) , particularly the truncated version of this chimera lacking the µ HD ( scaffolding deficient ) , to maintain normal coat morphology and distribution in FCHO2 - silenced HeLa cells . Also , invaginating coats are observed at the edges of flat lattices in FCHO2 knockdown cells ( Figure 4 . 8 ) . FCHO1 and FCHO2 could interact with an unidentified protein through the unstructured linker region allowing it to be recruited at lower levels in the absence of the µ HD . The identity of such a partner and how this partner contributes to reducing CCS size and increasing CCS number remain to be determined . 144 In the second model , FCHO1 / 2 , eps15 and intersectin may define the outer perimeter of emerging coated structures . In doing so they could prevent the coalescence and fusion of individual CCSs , maintaining a higher number of more uniform structures . To accomplish this , the putative binding partner of the FCHO1 / 2 unstructured linker ( as the µ HD - truncated mutant can substitute ) may act to directly or indirectly affect free clathrin triskelion leg availability , preventing or not favoring the anti - parallel engagement of free legs by adjacent lattices . This could be an important role for these proteins as flat clathrin lattices can persist on the plasma membrane for periods greater than 10 minutes ( Figure 4 . 12 ) ( Saffarian et al . , 2009 ) . In addition , CCSs may move laterally within the plasma membrane actively on microtubules in some contexts ( Rappoport et al . , 2003 ) or experience natural lateral translations during their lifetime at the surface ( Loerke et al . , 2009 ) . Perhaps through the µ HD and eps15 / intersectin , FCHO1 / 2 promote CCS nucleation and at later stages the proposed linker - binding partner regulates adjacent lattice tethering . Reduction of FCHO2 would allow clustering of CCSs and expansion of individual regions of clathrin coats , but in this model it is unclear how overexpression of FCHO1 / 2 would reduce CCS size . Also while this model explains how ENTH - µ HD can rescue the FCHO2 knockdown phenotype because less importance is placed on membrane bending , it cannot account for the µ HD truncation mutant’s targeting to CCSs . Altogether , while the second model cannot fully explain some of the observations from the rescue experiments , it is better supported by the data . Because FCHO1 / 2 is not restricted to diffraction - limited spots in HeLa cells ( Figures 4 . 1 and 4 . 2 ) ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) and overexpressed FCHO1 and FCHO2 populate the majority of clathrin - coated structures , we do not believe that de novo clathrin - coated buds differ from the long - lived , static plaques by selective incorporation of either muniscin . Nor do we believe de 145 novo spots carry the bulk of cargo or represent the major carrier in receptor - mediated endocytosis ( Saffarian et al . , 2009 ) as the enlarged CCS in FCHO2 - silenced cells are still operational . Reduction by ~ 50 % of the actin - binding endocytic proteins HIP1 and Hip1R in HeLa cells causes the formation of large clathrin assemblies similar to what we find in FCHO1 / 2 - silenced cells , yet Tf internalization is not affected ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2004 ) . This demonstrates that altered morphology does not necessarily translate into altered function . Instead , a plausible scenario is that at early assembly times , the precise ratio of FCHO1 / 2 ( and eps15 and intersectin ) to AP - 2 and clathrin may define whether a diffraction - limited spot or an extensive patch forms . We predict a lower ration of FCHO1 / 2 and its partners to AP - 2 , clathrin and epsin would bias the assemblage toward formation of a plaque - like structure . The FCHO1 / 2 RNAi phenotype in HeLa cells is clearly consistent with this idea . However the prevailing levels of FCHO2 and adaptors and steady state clathrin morphology in the cell lines examined are not consistent with this idea ( Figure 4 . 16 and 4 . 17 ) . For instance , MCF - 7 cells have the largest CCSs examined and have near undetectable levels of intersectin and Dab2 , but HT - 1080 cells have uniform and small CCSs but also have very low levels of these two proteins . Normal HeLa cells have a phenotype between these two cell lines yet have higher levels of all FCHO binding partners and in addition endogenous FCHO2 is present at high concentrations at large CCSs in these cells . Instead , FCHO binding partner levels may be more predictive of the sensitivity of a cell line to FCHO1 / 2 knockdown . FCHO1 / 2 control of CCS size is likely more complex . FCHO2 is a phosphoprotein ; treatment of HeLa cells with the protein phosphatase inhibitor Calyculin A ( Suganuma et al . , 1990 ) causes FCHO2 to migrate more slowly on gels ( unpublished observations ) . Phosphorylation status could either regulate partner binding to the µ HD or linker directly or 146 affect µ HD conformation / orientation ( Roberts - Galbraith et al . , 2010 ) . Another possibility is auto - inhibition . The EFC domain protein Pacsin 1 is auto - inhibited from membrane deformation by binding of its C - terminal SH3 domain back on the EFC domain and this inhibition is relieved by engagement of the SH3 domain by dynamin ( Rao et al . , 2010 ) . Binding of FCHO1 / 2 to one of its binding partners could relieve µ HD inhibition of EFC binding to the plasma membrane and ensuing curvature generation . It is unknown currently if the µ HD can bind to the FCHO EFC domain or linker region . The last important finding of this study is that FCHO1 and FCHO2 are somewhat redundant but also have some unique properties . Both FCHO1 and FCHO2 are capable of restoring CCS number and size in FCHO2 silenced HeLa cells and have similar effects when overexpressed . Therefore we believe they are both similarly potent in ability to promote nucleation of CCSs and regulate clathrin lattice size . Biochemically these proteins are quite different . FCHO1 is very sensitive to aggregation upon exogenous expression and native and expressed FCHO1 was slightly degraded ( Figures 4 . 1F , 4 . 5B . 4 . 17 ) . Considering its ability to aggregate , controlled proteolysis may prevent complications from this byproduct . FCHO1 also makes additional interactions that FCHO2 does not : with AP - 2 through the unstructured linker and CALM and HIV - 1 Rev binding protein ( Hrb ) through the µ HD ( unpublished observations ) . What is more , FCHO1 recovers more slowly in FRAP experiments perhaps as a result of slower exchange at CCSs from these additional contacts . The ability to bind CALM and Hrb may impart indirect sorting abilities on FCHO1 as there is evidence these proteins sort SNAREs ( Harel et al . , 2008 ; Pryor et al . , 2008 ) . Also , while FCHO2 is expressed in all cell lines tested , FCHO1 is not . Tissue specific expression of FCHO1 may be important for cargo sorting . The presence of FCHO1 in purified CCVs is consistent with 147 a role in cargo sorting and although live - cell experiments show the majority of FCHO1 exiting the evanescent field , trace fluorescence could often be seen until clathrin budding ( Figure 4 . 4 ) . Furthermore , a high - throughput screen for protein - protein interactions in the Transforming Growth Factor β pathway identified an interaction between FCHO1 and Activin receptor - like kinase 2 ( Alk2 ) ( Barrios - Rodiles et al . , 2005 ) . Alk2 is a Ser / Thr kinase transmembrane receptor involved in gastrulation ( Gu et al . , 1999 ) , so FCHO1 may act as a CLASP to regulate signaling pathways during development . Future studies will need to determine if FCHO1 and FCHO2 can sort cargo molecules directly similar to Syp1p in yeast ( Reider et al . , 2009 ) . In conclusion , FCHO1 and FCHO2 are partially redundant endocytic proteins . They are non - essential regulators of CCS nucleation and actively maintain the morphology of individual CCS . The precise mechanistic details of lattice size regulation remain to be determined as does the identity of the postulated linker - binding partner that is important for this activity . FCHO1 / 2 are also potential cargo - sorting proteins based on structural and evolutionary evidence and the uptake of various cargo in their absence will remain an intriguing avenue of study . 148 5 . 0 CONCLUSIONS 5 . 1 INTRODUCTION The field of clathrin - mediated endocytosis is an incredibly rich area of study because of the many participating researchers , the many normal and disease state processes it touches on and its relatively long history , going back to 1964 . Yet within the discipline of vesicular traffic , particular aspects of CME , such as the precise mechanism of vesicle nucleation , remain quite unclear when compared with other types of coated vesicles . A partial explanation for this is the apparent near - dizzying array of proteins implicated in endocytosis in mammals that have arisen during the course of evolution and have limited the reach of genetic studies in yeast . Still , multiple concepts of CCV nucleation , some now defunct , have been offered that have helped shape our understanding of this complex process . This thesis has helped further define the mechanisms by which clathrin - coated structures nucleate on the cell plasma membrane in preparation for endocytosis by clarifying one model and modifying another . Careful biochemical investigation of how the brain - enriched PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 generating enzyme PIPKI γ interfaces with the endocytic machinery has identified the binding site on the sandwich subdomain of AP - 2 β 2 appendage and given rise to a model in which PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 generation for vesicle nucleation can be temporally regulated . Also , in vivo studies in this thesis have confirmed previous biochemical studies of the AP - 2 β 2 appendage 149 platform and sandwich binding sites , showing different levels of accessibility to various binding partners during assembly . The AP - 2 β 2 appendage binds to clathrin and thus plays an important role in vesicle nucleation as well . Finally , experiments of siRNA - mediated knockdown of the recently identified endocytic proteins FCHO1 and FCHO2 have revealed their involvement in clathrin - coated structure nucleation ; they are not absolutely required but may contribute to efficiency and size regulation . My results strengthen the model of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - driven vesicle nucleation for CME but also highlight how multiple pathways might operate in parallel to initiate budding . 5 . 2 COORDINATION OF LOCALIZED LIPID METABOLISM BY AP - 2 5 . 2 . 1 Defining the AP - 2 β 2 subunit appendage sandwich subdomain binding site The work from Chapter 2 of this thesis along with subsequent studies have greatly helped our understanding of the endocytic accessory factor / adaptor binding sites on the AP - 2 β 2 appendage . Of the four appendage binding sites , one upon the platform and one upon the sandwich subdomain of both the α and β 2 appendages , the β 2 sandwich site is the most recently discovered and characterized ( Edeling et al . , 2006a ; Schmid et al . , 2006 ) . Yet it also plays a critical role in assembly through binding clathrin ( Edeling et al . , 2006a ) and a variety of other proteins , including PIPKI γ ( Chapter 2 ) ( Nakano - Kobayashi et al . , 2007 ) . Therefore defining this site will aid in a deeper understanding of assembly during CME and will enable the use of protein - protein interaction data in the future to build predictive , computational models of CCS assembly ( Gong et al . , 2008 ) . 150 Using previously identified residues on the AP - 2 β 2 appendage sandwich subdomain ( Edeling et al . , 2006a ; Schmid et al . , 2006 ) and mutagenesis along with binding assays for interaction with PIPKI γ 661 , I have confirmed that the sandwich site binding pocket is delimited by residues Gln804 , Tyr815 , Lys808 and Gln756 in a clockwise circle ( see Figure 2 . 11 and 2 . 16 ) . I also established that residues Phe635 , Trp642 and Tyr644 of the mouse PIPKI γ 661 isoform are necessary for binding , similar to other hydrophobic appendage binding motifs . Gratifyingly , my results were subsequently confirmed by the crystal structure of human PIPKI γ 668 C - terminal peptide 639 YF PTDERS W V Y SPLH 653 in complex with the β 2 appendage ( Kahlfeldt et al . , 2010 ) . Phe640 ( Phe635 in mouse ) and Trp647 ( Trp642 in mouse ) anchor the kinase by inserting into the binding pocket while a short α - helix in the intervening residues positions the side chains ( Figure 2 . 16 ) . Tyr644 stabilizes this interaction through an electrostatic interaction with β 2 Lys808 . Eps15 binds to the same site in a similar but different fashion . A co - crystal of the murine eps15 peptide 721 S F GDG F A DF STL 732 with the β 2 appendage sandwich domain reveals how Phe722 occupies the same pocket as Phe640 in PIPKI γ and Phe729 inserts into the space for Trp647 of PIPKI γ ( Schmid et al . , 2006 ) . However Phe726 occupies a shallow pocket unutilized by PIPKI γ and requires a tight turn accommodated by adjacent Gly725 . Also , PIPKI γ 668 makes additional contacts with its downstream residues 650 SPLH 653 as it wraps around the sandwich subdomain bringing its total interface to 774 Å compared with 395 Å for eps15 ( Kahlfeldt et al . , 2010 ) . These differences may explain the lower dissociation constant of the PIPKI γ 668 peptide ( 22 µ M ) ( Kahlfeldt et al . , 2010 ) in comparison with eps15 ( 46 µ M ) ( Schmid et al . , 2006 ) , however eps15 has a much higher apparent affinity for β 2 appendage in our pull - down assays ( Figure 2 . 17 ) . The entire length of this short eps15 peptide was crystallized ( Schmid et al . , 2006 ) 151 so perhaps additional downstream residues not included in the peptide wrap around the sandwich domain like they do in PIPKI γ or multivalent interactions exist . A third recent co - crystal of intersectin 1 with the β 2 appendage sandwich site reveals the complexity of this binding surface ( Pechstein et al . , 2010a ) . Human intersectin 1 847 PNN W AD F SSTWP 858 peptide inserts Trp850 into the pocket that accommodates eps15 Phe722 or PIPKI γ Phe640 and Phe853 into the site for eps15 Phe729 or PIPKI γ Trp647 . This configuration connects the two aromatic - accepting pockets with the least number of intermediate residues in contrast to the short α - helix of PIPKI γ or tight turn loop of eps15 . The unifying theme of these modes of binding are two variably spaced Phe or Trp residues that insert into the two pockets on β 2 and additional flanking contacts that stabilize the interaction . Alignment of eps15 and PIPKI γ 661 did not show any significant homology other than the spacing for the distal anchoring Phe and Phe / Trp residues ( Figure 2 . 12 ) . Scanning the C - termini of other AP - 2 β 2 appendage sandwich partners including AP180 , CALM and amphiphysin I / II did reveal some homology to eps15 , however ( Figure 5 . 1 ) . These proteins all had at least one sequence in which the first and second anchoring Phe residues of eps15 are conserved in spacing . Also the eps15 Asp724 is conserved in all proteins accept CALM . However these proteins do not have the required Gly in analogous position to eps15 Gly725 that is required to place the adjacent Phe in the middle of a tight turn and they lack the third anchoring Phe at eps15 position 729 ( Figure 5 . 1 ) . Perhaps these proteins are not required to make this tight turn and only utilize two anchoring aromatic residues . Reading the AP180 primary sequence in reverse places a Gly in this position but the position for the third anchoring Phe residue is replaced by Val or Ile . If these sequences really do make up the sandwich binding motif in these proteins , this may explain the higher sensitivity of their binding to mutations in the sandwich sidechains relative to eps15 152 Figure 5 . 1 : Alignment of β 2 appendage sandwich subdomain binding proteins . Primary sequences from mouse endocytic proteins were aligned in ClustalW . Key known ( eps15 , intersectin ) and prospective anchoring residues are boxed . The starting residue numbers and NCBI accession numbers are indicated . ( Edeling et al . , 2006a ) . Alternatively , these proteins could anchor two aromatic residues into the sandwich pocket in a manner similar to PIPKI γ without the need for glycines and a tight loop . Intersectin 1 does align nicely with eps15 but intersectin Trp850 binds to the pocket of β 2 that Phe722 of eps15 engages , not the shallow Phe726 pocket as explained above . The plasticity of the β 2 sandwich site in its ability to bind unstructured motifs of different lengths and conformations makes it rather unique among the appendage binding sites . This is especially true in light of the fact that it also binds the structured distal leg of clathrin ( Edeling et al . , 2006a ; Knuehl et al . , 2006 ) . Defining a consensus motif for the sandwich subdomain is difficult but may conform to one or more of the following : 1 . [ F / L ] XXGFXDF for eps15 and related sequences ( Schmid et al . , 2006 ) , 2 . FX n WXY for PIPKI γ and related sequences ( Chapter 2 ) , 3 . WXXF for intersectin 1 and related sequences ( Pechstein et al . , 2010a ) or 4 . FXDXF for other proteins ( Figure 5 . 1 ) , though this is also an α appendage platform binding sequence . Whether these slightly different modes of engaging the β 2 appendage sandwich site have 153 different effects on recruitment of these proteins or their sensitivity to clathrin assembly remain to be determined . 5 . 2 . 2 Kinase - mediated PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 production for neuronal and somatic cell CME An important question arising from this thesis dissertation is : does targeting of PIPKI γ 661 ( 668 in humans ) to AP - 2 for localized PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 generation and stimulation of CCS nucleation constitute a general mechanism for endocytosis in all cell types ? Genetic studies in mice suggest that PIPKI γ and its PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - hydrolyzing counterpart synaptojanin 1 are required for proper CCV generation at the synapse during compensatory endocytosis ( Cremona et al . , 1999 ; Wenk et al . , 2001 ; Di Paolo et al . , 2004 ) . Indeed , PIPKI γ mRNA and protein is highly expressed in the brain and one or the other can be detected in various other tissues ( Ishihara et al . , 1998 ; Wenk et al . , 2001 ; Giudici et al . , 2004 ; Schill and Anderson , 2009 ; Volpicelli - Daley et al . , 2010 ) . However specific detection of the PIPKI γ 661 isoform by RT - PCR or Western blot shows that it is restricted to the brain with more moderate expression levels in the heart , lung and perhaps the liver and pancreas but is absent from the gut ( Giudici et al . , 2004 ; Schill and Anderson , 2009 ) . An isolated expression pattern is hard to reconcile with a general role in nucleation during CME in somatic cells , nonetheless knockdown of PIPKI γ 668 in HeLa cells reduces Tf internalization ( Bairstow et al . , 2006 ) . Instead , PIPKI α and PIPKI β could compensate for CME in tissue where PIPKI γ is low . The mRNA and protein tissue distribution of these proteins is wider ( Ishihara et al . , 1996 ; Loijens and Anderson , 1996 ; Wenk et al . , 2001 ; Volpicelli - Daley et al . , 2010 ) . In support of this , forced expression of human PIPKI α and PIPKI β ( PIPKI β and PIPKI α , respectively in mouse 154 due to independent discoveries and naming ) , increases Tf internalization and CCP surface density in HeLa cells while PIPKI γ does not ( Padron et al . , 2003 ) . Likewise , only knockdown of PIPKI β reduced Tf internalization . Also , an enzymatically inactive truncated mouse PIPKI β ( mPIPKI β , or human PIPKI α , hPIPKI α ) rescues mutant colony - stimulating factor 1 receptor signaling by stabilizing it at the plasma membrane through dominant - negative inhibition of endocytosis ( Davis et al . , 1997 ) . In an extension of this , mPIPKI β expression increased EGFR internalization in NR6 cells ( a variant of Swiss 3T3 ) and trunctated mPIPKI β blocked EGFR internalization , plasma membrane localization of full - length mPIPKI β , and reduced clathrin labeling at the membrane ( Barbieri et al . , 2001 ) . Whether these effects are due to general changes in PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels in these cell lines , as hPIPKI β modulation in HeLa cells results in ( Padron et al . , 2003 ) , or if kinase targeting to CCSs is affected and the mechanism of how this might occur , remain to be determined and are important avenues of study . Another important factor is the nucleation of CCV from static and long - lived , yet endocytically active CCSs observed in some cultured cell lines ( Chapter 4 ) ( Merrifield et al . , 2005 ; Rappoport et al . , 2005 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) and isolated primary cells ( Bellve et al . , 2006 ) . If CCVs can nucleate from the edge of these flat clathrin lattices , the required levels of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 for their assembly may be relaxed . The nucleation potential may come from the adjacent adaptors and clathrin . In this scenario , the prevailing levels of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 on the plasma membrane may be sufficient and targeting of a lipid kinase to these structures unnecessary . If CME at the synapse and in non - neuronal cells differs in the mode of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 generation used for CCS nucleation , this may reflect the fundamental differences of this process at these two locations . Neuronal CME for compensatory endocytosis during neurotransmission is 155 a specialized form of endocytosis that must be rapid to maintain organism homeostasis . For instance , the time constant of CME in most synaptic terminals is on the scale of 10 - 20 seconds ( reviewed in ( Royle and Lagnado , 2010 ) ) but the productive population of CCSs of cultured somatic cells was measured with a time constant of 87 seconds ( Loerke et al . , 2009 ) and intravital imaging of CME in non - neuronal tissue reveals that it may be even slower ( Roberto Weigert , personal communication ) . Neuronal CCV formation also differs structurally as there are numerous brain - specific endocytic proteins including AP180 ( CALM homologue ) , auxilin ( GAK homologue ) and amphiphysin 1 ( Jung and Haucke , 2007 ) as well as neuron - specific alternatively spliced transcripts for AP - 2 α and clathrin light chain ( Jackson et al . , 1987 ; Ball et al . , 1995 ) . Lastly , the unique combination of cargo such as Syt and the neurotransmitter transporters VMAT2 , VAchT and VGLUT1 ( Jung and Haucke , 2007 ) and potentially high cargo concentration if diffusion is limited after SV fusion may also contribute to the speed of clathrin nucleation during CME in neurons . The mechanism of targeting PIPKI γ 661 to AP - 2 for rapid , localized PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 generation and equally rapid negative regulation of coupled clathrin assembly and kinase eviction may be an adaptation to ensure speed and directionality of CME in the brain . 5 . 2 . 3 The AP - 2 appendages as scaffolds for lipid metabolizing enzymes The evidence for a role of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in nucleating and stabilizing CCSs is now incontrovertible . Most of the central adaptors and accessory factors contain modular domains that bind to this lipid and experimentally perturbing PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels influence the number of CCSs at the plasma membrane of cells in culture . A third line of evidence is the expanding list of 156 phosphatidylinositol kinases and phosphatases that physically bind to the AP - 2 appendages and thus place them appropriately to modify the lipid environment of CCSs ( Figure 5 . 2 ) . The stage for nucleation is set by PI4K enzymes that generate PtdIns ( 4 ) P at the plasma membrane from PtdIns ( Vicinanza et al . , 2008 ) . In non - neuronal cells , PIPKI α and β likely contribute to global PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at the plasma membrane that can diffuse and participate in CME or they may bind through their kinase core domain to AP - 2 µ 2 ( Krauss et al . , 2006 ) for localized production . In this scenario , the AP - 2 core would probably need to undergo a transition from the ‘closed’ to ‘open’ state and extend the µ 2 C - terminus due to steric constraints for binding ( Kahlfeldt et al . , 2010 ) or to position the kinase domain adjacent to its substrate . Therefore if binding the µ 2 subunit is functionally relevant , an appreciable level of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 would need to be present initially to stabilize a few molecules of AP - 2 to engage the lipid kinase . In neuronal cells , many endocytic proteins are termed ‘dephosphins’ because they are phosphorylated under resting conditions by Cdk5 and this evidently prevents physical interaction with partner proteins or activity ( Cousin and Robinson , 2001 ) . PIPKI γ 661 is a dephosphin and is localized to the presynapse at resting conditions where phosphorylation of Ser645 ( mouse residue ) ( Nakano - Kobayashi et al . , 2007 ) prevents the C - terminal residues ( 630 - 661 ) from engaging the AP - 2 β 2 appendage sandwich subdomain ( Chapter 2 ) . The structural data suggest that an added phosphate group on Ser645 ( Ser650 in humans ) would prevent hydrogen bonding with the appendage backbone ( Kahlfeldt et al . , 2010 ) and weaken the interaction . Following an action potential and Ca 2 + influx , dephosphins are dephosphorylated by calcineurin ( Cousin and Robinson , 2001 ) . Allowing AP - 2 to bind PIPKI γ 661 stimulates the kinase activity ( Nakano - Kobayashi et al . , 2007 ) and is additionally driven by a positive feedback loop of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 stimulation of PLD ( Arneson et al . , 1999 ) . PLD hydrolyzes the phospholipid PtdCho to the 157 soluble headgroup choline and membrane - bound PtdOH and this lipid product stimulates PIPKI activity ( Jenkins et al . , 1994 ; Ishihara et al . , 1998 ) . The positive regulator PtdOH can also be produced by DGK δ when it engages the α appendage platform positioning it at CCSs ( Kawasaki et al . , 2007 ) . These appendage interactions promote PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 generation and stimulate local AP - 2 accumulation and clathrin assembly . Interestingly , PtdOH production promotes limited CCS assembly on lysosome membranes in vitro even in the absence of ATP ( and potential PtdOH - stimulated PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 production ) ( Arneson et al . , 1999 ) and PtdOH specifically influences EGFR and not TfR endocytosis ( Antonescu et al . , 2010 ) . PtdOH may perform an important unappreciated role in CCS nucleation , perhaps binding a subset of endocytic adaptors or influence membrane biochemistry or curvature . Future research should focus on how PtdOH regulates assembly and specific cargo internalization . How are positive regulators of nucleation regulated themselves ? In Drosophila , excessive PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 production from overexpression of the PIPKI Skittles inhibits CME of yolk protein endocytosis in a superficially similar fashion to Skittles hypomorphic alleles ( Compagnon et al . , 2009 ) . Therefore controlled levels of PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 are important , not just its production . The activity of PIPKI γ 661 appears to be regulated not by phosphorylation directly but through binding its partner proteins AP - 2 and talin , a process influenced by PIPKI γ 661 phosphorylation status ( Di Paolo et al . , 2002 ; Ling et al . , 2002 ; Ling et al . , 2003 ; Nakano - Kobayashi et al . , 2007 ) . By controlling PIPKI γ 661 binding to these proteins , its localization and activity could be controlled . The requirement for PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at this later assembly stage may decrease as many assembly proteins become concentrated and can assist in recruitment through cooperative actions . This thesis has shown that clathrin binding to the β 2 appendage sandwich site causes displacement of PIPKI γ 661 and therefore could regulate continued or excessive PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 158 production at CCS ( Figure 5 . 2 ) . In a lysosome clathrin coat recruitment assay , ongoing PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 production is not required to allow some clathrin assembly ( Arneson et al . , 1999 ) , supporting this assertion . Icannot exclude the possibility that PIPKI γ 661 could switch to the µ 2 subunit following clathrin assembly through the C - terminal YSPL motif ( Bairstow et al . , 2006 ) or kinase domain ( Krauss et al . , 2006 ) . The YSPL motif scheme seems unlikely as I showed that β 2· µ 2 hemicomplex binding was negligible , and the kinase would have to compete with YXX ∅ motif - containing cargo . The AP - 2 appendages also bind directly or indirectly to polyphosphoinositide phosphatases that regulate assembly progression and uncoating ( Figure 5 . 2 ) . The SH2 domain - containing inositol phosphatase 2 ( SHIP2 ) hydrolyzes the C - 5 phosphate of PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( preferred substrate ) and PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 at the plasma membrane ( Hejna et al . , 1995 ) and knockdown of SHIP2 causes shortening of CCS lifetimes ( Nakatsu et al . , 2010 ) . SHIP2 is targeted to CCSs by its interaction with intersectin ( Nakatsu et al . , 2010 ) and intersectin binds to the α and β 2 appendage sandwich subdomains ( Pechstein et al . , 2010a ) . Endocytic adaptors can bind PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 ( Rapoport et al . , 1997 ; Itoh et al . , 2001 ) and although under normal circumstances levels of this lipid are low in cells ( Wymann and Schneiter , 2008 ) , controlled hydrolysis of this binding surface for adaptors may extend CCS assembly by slightly weakening the assembly to allow appropriate incorporation of cargo and regulatory factors . This may be particularly important in non - neuronal cells where speed is not paramount but producing cargo - laden vesicles is . Interestingly , SHIP2 is recruited to CCSs early in assembly with clathrin but departs the coat before budding ( Nakatsu et al . , 2010 ) . Intersectin binds to the β 2 appendage sandwich subdomain like PIPKI γ 661 so that as clathrin assembles , perhaps intersectin’s and consequently SHIP2’s connections with the endocytic machinery are weakened and its presence 159 Figure 5 . 2 : Phosphoinositide metabolism at clathrin - coated buds . Schematic representation of key enzymes responsible for PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 synthesis and the mapped interactions with the AP - 2 adaptor appendages .

This could allow a brief period in which stabilized PtdIns ( 3 , 4 , 5 ) P 3 can exert its effect on assembly speed after cargo has been incorporated but prior to fully active phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis for uncoating . However the precise stoichiometries of these lipid species at the nerve terminal or CCSs makes these models only speculative . Synaptojanin is a phosphatidylinositol polyphosphatase that functions at the later stages of assembly to hydrolyze PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in preparation for removal of adaptors and clathrin . Synaptojanin is alternatively spliced ( Ramjaun and McPherson , 1996 ) as two ubiquitiously expressed isoforms : synaptojanin 145 ( SJ145 ) , a brain - enriched isoform containing an α appendage sandwich binding motif ( WXXF ) , and synaptojanin 170 ( SJ170 ) , containing α appendage platform ( DPF , FXDXF ) and an additional sandwich binding motif ( WXXF ) ( Jha et al . , 2004 ; Mishra et al . , 2004 ) . Synaptojanin also binds a cohort of other SH3 domain - containing endocytic proteins including endophilin , amphiphysin and intersectin ( Cestra et al . , 1999 ) . While SJ170 is present at CCS throughout the entire lifecycle , likely resulting from the additional AP - 2 contacts , SJ145 is recruited as a burst at budding and probably depends more heavily on binding to its late - stage binding partners endophilin and amphiphysin for its timed recruitment ( Perera et al . , 2006 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . A recent in vitro study suggests membranes of higher curvature stimulate synaptojanin - mediated PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 hydrolysis through increased targeting by the BAR domain binding partner endophilin and higher phosphatase activity for PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 in highly curved membranes ( Chang - Ileto et al . , 2011 ) . Combining these data for a molecular description , in non - neuronal cells where the SJ170 isoform predominates , extensive interactions of SJ170 with the AP - 2 α appendage place it at CCSs during the entire lifecycle . Low basal activity of SJ170 controls the rate of assembly by dynamically balancing PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 levels , similar to the proposed role of SHIP2 , but at deeply invaginated buds SJ170 activity is maximal 161 based on curvature and the presence of BAR domain binding partners . Perhaps SJ170 activity is stimulated through binding its partner proteins . Through binding only to the α appendage ( and not the β 2 sandwich ) and additional contacts with other endocytic proteins , synaptojanin ensures its presence at late stage buds to promote the loosening of adaptor - membrane interactions in preparation for uncoating . A third phosphoinositide 5 - phosphatase , OCRL1 , is recruited to CCSs at a late stage just after scission ( Erdmann et al . , 2007 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . OCRL1 binds to the clathrin terminal domain and also to the AP - 2 α appendage via a single platform binding FXDXF motif ( Figure 5 . 2 ) ( Ungewickell et al . , 2004 ) . These interactions may contribute to OCRL1’s initial recruitment but are soon lost as the vesicle uncoats and it might be maintained on the vesicle by interacting with the early endosome protein APPL1 ( Erdmann et al . , 2007 ) . While the role of OCRL1 is not well understood it could ensure an early endosome lipid composition of high PtdIns ( 3 ) P and low PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . The extensive connections of AP - 2 with lipid modifying enzymes , particularly three phosphoinositol phosphatases , highlight that phosphoinositide species are carefully monitored and fine - tuned at sites of CME ( Sun et al . , 2007a ) . 5 . 3 THE AP - 2 β 2 APPENDAGE AS A TEMPORALLY REGULATED ASSEMBLY PLATFORM It has long been known that assembly of clathrin around the AP - 2 β 2 subunit causes interference with bound β 2 appendage binding partners ( Cupers et al . , 1998 ; Owen et al . , 2000 ) . This was the basis of the ‘changing hubs’ model in which early in assembly the AP - 2 appendages constitute 162 the primary hub , coordinating numerous interactions with accessory factors . As clathrin assembles , the clathrin terminal domains begin to outnumber the molecules of AP - 2 and become the primary hub , causing a migration of endocytic proteins . This migration is facilitated by a displacement of a subset ( β 2 appendage platform binding partners ) of proteins from the β 2 appendage by competition from clathrin ( Schmid et al . , 2006 ; Schmid and McMahon , 2007 ) . In particular , because β - arrestin 1 binding to AP - 2 β 2 and clathrin was shown to be mutually exclusive in pull down assays and increased binding of clathrin ( not present in excess ) to the AP - 2 β 2 appendage and hinge slightly reduced bound β - arrestin 1 in similar assays , it was concluded that β - arrestin 1 was maintained within CCVs through its interaction with clathrin after changing hubs ( Schmid et al . , 2006 ) . This intriguing , albeit not well supported , model is one possible explanation for how forming CCSs can organize their many connections and form in an ordered , vectorial progression . In Chapters 2 and 3 of this thesis I have presented data in support of an alternate model : clathrin assembly causes displacement of AP - 2 β 2 appendage sandwich subdomain partners while platform binding proteins including , β - arrestin 1 , are unaffected . For some proteins such as amphiphysin I / II and AP180 , their residency within forming CCVs could be maintained by their additional binding to AP - 2 α appendage or to the clathrin terminal domain ( Edeling et al . , 2006a ) . Another , eps15 , is lost from mature areas of assembly where clathrin is completely polymerized and is found only at the lattice edges where unoccupied AP - 2 molecules reside ( Tebar et al . , 1996 ; Edeling et al . , 2006a ) . Paradoxically , eps15 also binds to the α appendage through numerous DPF motifs in its C - terminus ( Benmerah et al . , 1996 ) yet is displaced from purified AP - 2 when assembled into clathrin cages in vitro ( Cupers et al . , 1998 ) . Partners of the α appendage are not subject to this regulation ; epsin 1 ( a β 2 platform and α platform binder ) and 163 Dab2 ( α platform binder ) are not removed from CCSs assembled on liposomes ( Mishra et al . , 2002a ) . PIPKI γ 661 does not bind clathrin or the α appendage directly and would be expected to depart the lattice or relocate to the edge like eps15 where it could generate PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to stabilize assembly . A corollary to this is that while the α appendage does not bind clathrin and does not appear to be significantly affected by clathrin binding to the β 2 appendage , one or more displacement mechanisms may operate on this appendage during the CCS lifecycle . AAK1 , the kinase that phosphorylates AP - 2 µ 2 and promotes the open conformation , is displaced from the α appendage by the Rab5 GEF hRME - 6 in a process that prepares the vesicle for uncoating by destabilizing AP - 2 and begins the transition to an early endosome environment ( Semerdjieva et al . , 2008 ) . To contrast this , I find that cargo - independent , activated β - arrestin 1 remains associated with CCSs throughout their lifetime whether it can bind to clathrin or not . These β - arrestin mutant proteins can also mediate the downregulation of the angiotensin receptor . If β - arrestin was lost from AP - 2 as clathrin assembles and it could not bind clathrin , it should be lost from the forming vesicle because the sorting CLASP does not contact the core coat components . Furthermore in Chapter 2 , the platform protein epsin 1 was not affected by sandwich targeting competitive peptides that affect clathrin binding to the β 2 appendage in pull down experiments . Therefore the β 2 platform proteins β - arrestins , ARH and epsin 1 constitute a privileged set of β 2 appendage proteins that are not subject to interference by clathrin . This makes intuitive sense : why would the clathrin machinery want to temporarily displace proteins that incorporate cargo into the budding vesicle , forcing them to engage clathrin ? At deeply invaginated buds , lateral diffusion of the adaptor - cargo pair could be slight but at small , shallow assemblies there is no guarantee that the adaptor - cargo complex will be recaptured . The ‘changing hubs’ model also 164 invokes the idea of using small irreversible steps , such as replacing lower affinity interactions with higher affinity interactions , to drive the reaction in one direction . However , for β - arrestin 1 a switch from binding the β 2 appendage platform to binding the clathrin terminal domain involves switching from a higher affinity ( ~ 2 µ M ( Edeling et al . , 2006a ; Schmid et al . , 2006 ) ) to a lower affinity ( 22 µ M ( Miele et al . , 2004 ) ) interaction . With the exception of PIPKI γ 661 , partners of the AP - 2 β 2 appendage sandwich site such as AP180 , CALM , eps15 and amphiphysin I / II ( Edeling et al . , 2006a ) are structural in nature ( although CALM and AP180 may sort cargo as well ( Harel et al . , 2008 ) ) . Causing dislocation of such proteins is much more likely to have an effect on the general architecture and dynamics of the forming CCV . An attractive idea is that reducing the contacts of tentative nucleation proteins eps15 and intersectin 1 ( Chapter 4 ) ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) with AP - 2 through clathrin polymerization may be a way to segregate the nucleation phase from the assembly phase and this could turn out to be a necessary transition in the vectorial formation of CCVs . In support of this , mass spectrometry analysis of isolated CCVs failed to detect eps15 or intersectin in CCVs from brain ( Blondeau et al . , 2004 ) or HeLa cells ( Borner et al . , 2006 ) and hepatic CCVs were de - enriched in eps15 based on the low number of identified peptides ( Girard et al . , 2005 ) . 5 . 4 CLATHRIN - COATED STRUCTURE NUCLEATION THROUGH FCHO PROTEINS The concept of a dedicated protein ( s ) at the plasma membrane to direct recruitment of AP - 2 and clathrin for nucleating CCSs is not a new idea . Early models favored the cytosolic tails of cargo molecules ( Pearse and Crowther , 1987 ) , Syt ( Zhang et al . , 1994 ) or Arf6 GTPase ( Paleotti et al . , 165 2005 ) as the ‘docking complex’ . While these intregral membrane or myristoylated protein nucleators have fallen out of favor more recently , the soluble EFC domain proteins FCHO1 and FCHO2 have emerged as playing an important role in nucleating CCSs ( this thesis and ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) ) . A provocative model has been put forth in which FCHO1 and FCHO2 are pioneer components of CCSs that bind to eps15 , eps15R , intersectin 1 and intersectin 2 and use these intermediate proteins to recruit AP - 2 to regions of assembly ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) . AP - 2 then binds and recruits its other partners including clathrin . Work presented in this thesis both support and reject pieces of this new model . FCHO1 and - 2 and their partner eps15 are undoubtedly early components of CCSs in cells where de novo forming buds predominate . FCHO1 / 2 also participate in CCS nucleation in some cell types because modulating their cellular levels similarly affects the number of CCSs . Yet never did I observe a complete loss of CCSs in the absence of FCHO1 and / or FCHO2 in any cell type examined . It follows that unlike PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , the presence of FCHO1 / 2 and its accessory factors for recruitment of AP - 2 to sites of endocytosis is not a prerequisite for CME . Therefore backup mechanisms must operate to ensure that CCSs form and perhaps multiple parallel pathways help ensure ongoing operation of the critical process of endocytosis . FCHO1 and FCHO2 possess properties that distinguish them from many of the other clathrin - associated proteins involved in endocytosis . Most of the CME proteins bind directly to AP - 2 and / or clathrin ( and some to PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and cargo molecules ) ( Traub , 2005 , 2011 ) . Notable exceptions are dynamin and actin that bind to each other and their own cohort of adaptors and these adaptors link them to AP - 2 and / or clathrin . This positioning likely separates their functions spatially and temporally from the assembly machinery . While FCHO1 can bind to 166 AP - 2 ( unpublished observations ) , FCHO1 / 2 also primarily bind indirectly to AP - 2 ( but not clathrin ) through adaptors such as eps15 / R and intersectin 1 / 2 ( Reider et al . , 2009 ; Henne et al . , 2010 ) . Also , FCHO1 in particular is beginning to resemble AP - 2 in that it contains an unstructured region connecting a folded globular domain , the µ HD , that coordinates multiple interactions with eps15 , eps15R , intersectin 1 , intersectin 2 , Dab2 ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) , CALM and Hrb ( unpublished observations ) . This module may be important for maintaining CCS number and size in specific tissues or cell lines . Additionally , this module may account for the internalization of AP - 2 - independent cargo in AP - 2 RNAi HeLa cells ( Barriere et al . , 2006 ; Keyel et al . , 2006 ; Maurer and Cooper , 2006 ) . Experiments in this thesis have highlighted an interesting connection between the CCS nucleation - associated proteins FCHO1 / 2 and the size of flat clathrin lattices or plaques observed on the ventral membrane of some adherent cells in culture . A handful of studies have shed light on how these AP - 2 and clathrin assemblies may expand laterally . Overexpression of the long isoform of Dab2 ( mouse p96 or rat p86 ) induces enlarged CCSs in NIH 3T3 cells ( Morris and Cooper , 2001 ) and COS7 and HeLa cells ( Chetrit et al . , 2009 ) . In BS - C - 1 cells , expression of a chimeric receptor containing the LDLR cytosolic domain along with Dab2 is necessary to induce so - called giant CCSs that cover a majority of the ventral plasma membrane ( Mettlen et al . , 2010 ) . The large structures were restricted to the ventral membrane unless a membrane - targeted myristoylated Dab2 was expressed alone suggesting the Dab2 cargo ( LDLR chimeric receptor and / or others ) promoted large clathrin assemblies specifically on the ventral membrane . Intriguingly , Dab2 recognizes NPXY motifs within β - integrins and promotes their endocytosis for focal adhesion disassembly ( Eto et al . , 2008 ; Chao and Kunz , 2009 ; Ezratty et al . , 2009 ; Teckchandani et al . , 2009 ) . Primary osteoclasts ( Akisaka et al . , 2003 ) and HeLa cells 167 ( Maupin and Pollard , 1983 ) contain extensive flat clathrin assemblies at regions of the ventral membrane closely apposed to the substrate ( 12 nm ) and frequently adjacent to focal contacts ( 10 nm substrate - membrane spacing ) ( Maupin and Pollard , 1983 ) suggesting these structures are involved in adhesion or regulate adhesive properties . In support of this , myotubes grown in culture contain substrate - bound integrins that cluster in focal adhesions and CCSs , and the CCSs can be competed from the integrins by NPXY motif - containing peptides encoding the integrin cytoplasmic domain ( De Deyne et al . , 1998 ) . High concentrations of integrins could recruit Dab2 and , as a consequence , AP - 2 and clathrin . Perhaps then cargo plays an important role in large , flat CCSs generation . Because FCHO1 / 2 bind Dab2 through their µ HD , FCHO1 / 2 may regulate large CCSs in cells with specific integrin expression patterns or underlying substrate compositions . The absence of FCHO1 / 2 could promote unregulated Dab2 - mediated assembly . Circumstantial evidence could implicate actin assembly in modulating the size of large CCs on the ventral surface of adherent cells . Hip1R , a CCV component , simultaneously can bind PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 , clathrin light chain and filamentous actin ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 1999 ) . Knockdown of Hip1R in HeLa cells causes stable association of CCSs with actin and enlargement of these CCSs ( Engqvist - Goldstein et al . , 2004 ) . This results from derepression of the actin nucleation promoting factor ( NPF ) cortactin ( Le Clainche et al . , 2007 ) , a Hip1R binding partner . Cortactin can then activate Arp2 / 3 that promotes branched actin formation . Intriguingly , yeast Syp1p binds to Las17p , the yeast homologue of mammalian WASP , through the linker region between the EFC domain and µ HD and negatively regulates its activity ( Boettner et al . , 2009 ) . Las17p / WASP act as actin NPFs for Arp2 / 3 , similar to cortactin . Therefore if the Syp1p - Las17p interaction is conserved in a vertebrate FCHO - WASP interaction , FCHO1 / 2 knockdown could result in unregulated branched actin formation . How this could 168 result in large CCSs , such as in the absence of Hip1R , is unclear . Perhaps actin polymerization at flat clathrin lattices , as opposed to invaginating buds with an inward trajectory , could push these assemblies into each other or somehow promote clathrin polymerization at the edges . Such an interaction could explain my results where the µ HD - truncated FCHO1 / 2 can rescue CCS morphology in FCHO2 knockdown cells . Though our lab has been unable to detect an FCHO - WASP interaction by GST pulldown assays , this may be a weak interaction that warrants further investigation . What exactly are FCHO1 / 2 doing at bud sites prior to the arrival of AP - 2 and how are they clustered in the absence of AP - 2 ? Certainly FCHO1 / 2 bind PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 to target to the plasma membrane ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) so that by any proposed mechanism , CCS nucleation requires PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 . Through a combination of FCHO1 / 2 oligomerization ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) and crosslinking by homodimerization of eps15 ( Tebar et al . , 1997 ) and heterodimerization of eps15 - intersectin ( Koh et al . , 2007 ) , clustered patches can form on the membrane . How such nascent assemblies would be prevented from uncontrolled or non - productive deposition remains to be determined . Is the role of these FCHO assemblies to optimize the membrane environment through clustering PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and locally increasing its concentration ? Perhaps FCHO1 / 2 also bind a type I PIPK to generate this lipid . It was proposed that FCHO1 / 2 initiate sculpting of the bud site ( Henne et al . , 2010 ) , but the presence of operational flat clathrin lattices in normal HeLa cells appears to lessen this claim . FCHO1 / 2 may increase the efficiency of recruiting AP - 2 to the plasma membrane , but it is hard to imagine an absolute requirement for this step when CCS can be reconstituted on cellular membranes in vitro through the addition of purified CCV proteins of which FCHO proteins are de - enriched or of sub - stoichiometric levels ( Mahaffey et al . , 1989 ) . 169 In light of the data presented in this thesis , are there multiple pathways that contribute simultaneously to CCS nucleation ? A goal in recent years has been to catalog the timing of individual endocytic proteins at CCSs in order to understand the encoded , sequential assembly instructions built into the machinery ( Liu et al . , 2009 ; Taylor et al . , 2011 ) . This approach will likely yield useful information , however another way to think of CCS nucleation and assembly is as analogous to the energy landscape model of protein folding ( Onuchic and Wolynes , 2004 ) . An unfolded protein can assume many different conformations of high entropy , but as it folds it moves down the sides of its folding funnel to its native conformation of lowest free energy and lowest entropy . There are multiple pathways ( or sides of the funnel ) to reach the same final protein fold . CCSs may form in a similar fashion in which different components could have the ability to contribute at different times . Different cell types also may use slightly different endocytic components and adaptors , yet as adaptors and clathrin triskelion begin to assemble they limit the possible number of subsequent conformations of the forming coated - pit and drive the process forward vectorially . Different tissues may depend to a varying extent on FCHO - mediated or purely PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 - driven CCS nucleation , though PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 will underlie all CCV generation events . Very little work has focused on the EFC domain proteins FCHO1 and FCHO2 until recently . Future studies will surely tease apart their precise function in nucleation and assembly . Of importance would be knockout studies in mice to see if FCHO1 / 2 are critical to life such has been done for other endocytic proteins ( Wenk et al . , 2001 ; Ferguson et al . , 2007 ; Chen et al . , 2009 ) . If FCHO1 is important during development by regulating endocytosis of Alk2 , this will likely further our understanding of the process . If FCHO knockout is lethal , embryonic fibroblasts could still be obtained and further studies of CCS nucleation and endocytosis could be 170 performed in the complete absence of FCHO1 / 2 . This would be a tractable system for further rescue experiments . Synaptosome - derived membrane recruitment assays ( Chapter 2 ) provide another powerful system to examine FCHO1 / 2 involvement in nucleation . FCHO proteins could be immunodepleted from brain cytosol or exogenous mutant FCHO proteins could be added , particularly FCHO1 / 2 lacking the µ HD . This system will allow examination of assembly prior to the establishment of steady state morphology in siRNA - treated cells . 5 . 5 CLOSING COMMENTS In this dissertation , I have helped clarify the sequence of events that give rise to clathrin - coated structures on the plasma membrane . The nucleation phase of clathrin - mediated endocytosis remains one of the least well understood and yet one of the most critical . In its simplest form it involves the lipid PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 and the coordinated interaction and recruitment of endocytic adaptors and clathrin to the plasma membrane . In the brain , where a rapid , specialized form of clathrin - mediated endocytosis occurs , PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 is generated by PIPKI γ . I have presented a precise molecular description of the requirements for interaction between the C - terminus of PIPKI γ and the clathrin adaptor AP - 2 β 2 subunit appendage for focal PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 production . This interaction is likely critical for rapid PtdIns ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 generation , adaptor recruitment and subsequent clathrin assembly for compensatory endocytosis during neurotransmission . In addition , the binding of PIPKI γ to the sandwich subdomain of the β 2 appendage subjects PIPKI γ to displacement from clathrin binding to the same site , effectively limiting activity and preparing the vesicle for uncoating after scission . I also have shown that clathrin binding leaves the other β 2 appendage binding site , the platform , unoccupied for the continued engagement of adaptors 171 such as β - arrestin or ARH . Finally , I have shown that the recently implicated endocytic proteins FCHO1 and FCHO2 are not absolutely required for the nucleation of clathrin - coated structures in cell culture . Instead these proteins are important for maintenance of the steady state distribution of clathrin - coated structure number and size . While other coated vesicle pathways such as COPI ( Beck et al . , 2009 ) and COPII ( Miller and Barlowe , 2010 ) are nucleated by GTPases , clathrin - mediated endocytosis may not rely on a proteinaceous nucleating factor which may afford the process more flexibility and tissue - specific specializations . 172 6 . 0 MATERIALS AND METHODS 6 . 1 CHAPTER 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 6 . 1 . 1 DNA constructs The recombinant proteins consisting of glutathione S - transferase ( GST ) fused to PIPKI γ ( mouse residues 460 - 635 , 460 - 661 , 636 - 661 , 630 - 661 , and 624 - 661 ) were generated by polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) using a mouse PIPKI γ 661 cDNA as a template followed by digestion and ligation into EcoRI / XhoI - cleaved pGEX - 4T - 1 .

PCR of endocytic protein transcripts was performed with Taq polymerase ( Genscript , Piscataway , NJ ) and the following primers : FCHO1 sense 5’ - CTG GCG CTG TGC CAC CTG GAA CT - 3’ , FCHO1 antisense 5’ - GTA CTC TCC CTC CGC AGC CGC TC - 3’ , FCHO2 sense 5’ - CCC CAG CAA TAT CTA GAC ACA GTC C - 3’ , FCHO2 antisense 5’ - TAC AGA AAG AGG AGT TGT GGG CC - 3’ , SGIP1 sense 5’ - GAA GTG GCA AGA CCC AGG CGT TCC - 3’ , SGIP1 antisense 5’ - GGA GGT GTT CCA GTG GGA AAA GGC C - 3’ , Beta - actin sense 5’ - GAG AGG CAT CCT CAC CCT GAA GTA C - 3’ , Beta - actin antisense 5’ - GCA CAG CCT GGA TAG CAA CGT ACA T - 3’ , Clathrin heavy chain sense 5’ - GGA AGG AGA GTC TCA GCC AGT GAA A - 3’ , Clathrin heavy chain antisense 5’ - TAT GTA ACT TCC CTC CAG CTT GGC C - 3’ , eps15 sense 5’ - TTG TTG CAG CAA GCG ATT CAG CCA - 3’ , eps15 antisense 5’ - AGG GCA GGG TCT TGT TGG AGT TCC - 3’ , eps15R sense 5’ - AGC CTC AAC AGC ACA GGG AGC CTG - 3’ , eps15R antisense 5’ - AAG GTT CTG GGT GAG GCC CGA GTG - 3’ . The PCR cycle used was 94 ° C for 3 min , 94 ° C for 30 s , 53 ° C ( FCHO2 and clathrin ) or 55 ° C ( remainder ) for 30 s , 72 ° C for one min , repeated for 30 cycles , final extension at 72 ° C for seven mins . 188 6 . 3 . 6 Microscopy Confocal fluorescence images were collected on an Olympus Fluoview 1000 microscope ( Center Valley , PA ) as described previously ( Keyel et al . , 2006 ) , however red fluorophores Alexa Fluor 568 and DiI were excited with a 558 nm laser line of a solid state diode laser . For fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments , cells were maintained on the microscope in DMEM supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum and 25 mM HEPES , pH 7 . 2 at 37°C on MatTek dishes ( MatTek Corp . , Ashland , MA ) . Cells were imaged continuously at 2s / frame with a 488 nm line argon laser and 5 µ m diameter circular subregions were bleached simultaneously with a 405 nm diode laser at maximum intensity for 2 seconds . Alternatively , cells were incubated for ~ 20 minutes in 0 . 45M sucrose containing media prior to imaging . For TIRF microscopy , cells were imaged on a Nikon Eclipse Ti inverted microscope ( Melville , NY ) with a 60x 1 . 49 NA oil immersion objective . GFP was excited with a 488 nm line sapphire solid state diode laser ( Coherent Inc . , Santa Clara , CA ) while the DsRed variant tandem Tomato was excited with a 561 nm solid state diode laser ( CrystaLaser , Reno , NV ) . For three color TIR - FM , transferrin - Alexa647 ( Molecular Probes , Carlsbad , CA ) was excited with a 638 nm line solid state diode laser ( Spectra Physics , Santa Clara , CA ) . All laser lines were selectively blocked within the laser bench and illumination ( both intensity and blanking ) was controlled by acousto - optical tunable filters . The excitation angle of incidence was controlled by a motorized TIRF illuminator and adjusted for each excitation wavelength between exposures . In all applications , a Z488 / 561 / 638rpc beamsplitter ( Chroma Technology Corp . , Bellows Falls , VT ) was used . Images were collected using a CoolSNAP HQ2 CCD camera ( Photometrics , Tucson , AZ ) . Data sets were acquired using Nikon Elements software . Typically images were collected at 0 . 3 - 0 . 5 Hz . 189 6 . 3 . 7 Image Processing To quantify the behavior of FCHO1 relative to clathrin and spot lifetimes , random clathrin - positive spots were chosen from the middle frame of data sets ( typically around 5 mins ) and manually scored for FCHO1 content and order of appearance . To quantify FRAP data , the integrated intensity of individual FCHO1 / 2 spots or AP - 2 beta spots within the bleach region were measured over time and normalize to an adjacent region lacking spots in Metamorph software ( Molecular Devices , Dowington , PA ) . Bleaching and recovery are reported relative to the average of three frames prior to bleaching . The recovery curves from 30 spots were fitted ( Graphpad Prism Software ) and the recovery and t 1 / 2 values were averaged . Particle tracking to determine lifetimes of AP - 2 in FCHO2 knockdown cells was performed in Imaris Software ( Bitplane , St . Paul , MN ) . Data sets were smoothed with a Gaussian filter followed by the use of the Spots module . The spots were estimated at a diameter of 0 . 5 µm and tracked with a Brownian motion algorithm . A maximum of 0 . 25 µm lateral movement of spots between frames was permitted and gap filling was used for up to 4 consecutive frames . Only tracks greater than or equal to 2 frames with a mean lateral speed less than 0 . 1 µm / second were scored . A total of 12 cells were analyzed from each condition . To quantitate AP - 2 structure properties , single confocal sections of the ventral cell surface were thresholded in Metamorph and regions were created around each thresholded object . Object size , fluorescence intensity and number were exported to Excel . To quantitate ligand internalization , confocal Z - stacks with 0 . 6 µm step - size through the entire volume of the cell monolayer were used to create a maximum Z projection . Images were background corrected and the integrated fluorescence intensity from a 14x14 µm region were recorded and averaged . 190 6 . 3 . 8 Electron Microscopy Adherent plasma membrane from cells treated with FCHO2 siRNA as described above were prepared for rapid - freeze , deep - etch electron microscopy as described previously ( Heuser , 2000 ) . Briefly , cells grown on oriented pieces of glass coverslip were disrupted by sonication , fixed in paraformaldehyde , and labeled with anti - FCHO2 rAb and then 15 - nm gold - conjugated anti - rabbit antibody before flash freezing in liquid helium ( Keyel et al . , 2006 ) . 6 . 3 . 9 Statistics In all figures , graphs represent average and error bars represent standard error . P values were determined by Student’s t - test or analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) and Tukey’s post - hoc test for multiple groups in SPSS ( IBM , Chicago , IL ) . 191 BIBLIOGRAPHY Abe , N . , Inoue , T . , Galvez , T . , Klein , L . , and Meyer , T .
