Phillies ∗ Department of Physics , Worcester Polytechnic Institute , Worcester , MA 01609 The experimental literature on the motion of mesoscopic probe particles through polymer solutions is systematically reviewed . The primary focus is the study of diﬀusive motion of small probe particles . Comparison is made with measurements of solution viscosities . A coherent description was obtained , namely that the probe diﬀusion coeﬃcient generally depends on polymer concentration as D p = D p 0 exp ( − αc ν ) . One ﬁnds that α depends on polymer molecular weights as α ∼ M 0 . 8 , and ν appears to have large - M and small - M values with a crossover linking them . The probe diﬀusion coeﬃcient does not simply track the solution viscosity ; instead , D p η typically increases markedly with increasing polymer concentration and molecular weight . In some systems , e . g . , hydroxypropylcellulose : water , the observed probe spectra are bi - or tri - modal . Extended analysis of the full probe phenomenology implies that hydroxypropylcellulose solutions are characterized by a single , concentration - independent , length scale that is approximately the size of a polymer coil . In a very few systems , one sees re - entrant or low - concentration - plateau behaviors of uncertain interpretation ; from their rarity , these behaviors are reasonably interpreted as corresponding to speciﬁc chemical eﬀects . True microrheological studies examining the motion of mesoscopic particles under the inﬂuence of a known external force are also examined . Viscosity from true microrheological measurements is in many cases substantially smaller than the viscosity measured with a macroscopic instrument . I . INTRODUCTION This review treats probe diﬀusion and related methods of investigating polymer dynamics . In a probe diﬀusion experiment , a dilute dispersion of mesoscopic probe par - ticles is mixed into a polymer solution . The motions or relative motions of the probe particles are then measured . In most experiments discussed here , probe motions arise from diﬀusion ; the small literature on driven motions of mesoscopic probes through polymer solutions is also re - viewed here . In some systems , probe motions involve multiple relaxations whose time dependences can be in - dependently determined . In others , a single relaxation determined a probe diﬀusion coeﬃcient D p . D p is sen - sitive to the probe radius R , polymer molecular weight M and concentration c , solution viscosity η , solvent vis - cosity η s , and other variables . The dependence of D p on these and other variables is used to infer how polymers move in solution . The remainder of this Section presents a historical background . Section II remarks brieﬂy on the theory un - derlying major experimental methods for studying probe diﬀusion . Section III presents the experimental phe - nomenology . Section IV discusses the systematics of that phenomenology . The literature on probe diﬀusion studies of polymer solutions tends to be divided into three parts , namely ( i ) optical probe diﬀusion studies , largely with quasi - elastic light scattering spectroscopy ( QELSS ) , ﬂuores - cence recovery after photobleaching ( FRAP ) , and Forced Rayleigh Scattering ( FRS ) , of the thermal motion of di - lute probe particles , ( ii ) microrheology studies in which an inferred mean - square particle displacement and a gen - eralized Stokes - Einstein relation are used to compute dy - namic moduli of the solution , and ( iii ) particle - tracking studies in which the detailed motions of individual par - ticles are recorded . Historically , Brown used particle tracking to study the motion now called Brownian . Optical probe diﬀu - sion as a method for studying polymer solutions dates back to Turner and Hallett 1 , who in 1976 examined polystyrene spheres diﬀusing through dextran solutions . The microrheology approach to interpreting probe dif - fusion stems from early work on Diﬀusing Wave Spec - troscopy ( DWS ) , e . g . , the 1993 chapter by Weitz and Pines 2 . Particle tracking methods were early applied to observing the motion of labelled tags in cell membranes as reviewed , e . g . , by Saxton and Jacobson 3 . The ex - perimental literatures in these three areas are less than entirely communicating . A . Other Reviews The optical probe diﬀusion literature has not recently been reviewed systematically . In 1985 , Phillies , et al . 4 re - examined extant optical probe studies of solutions of bovine serum albumin , polyethylene oxide , and poly - acrylic acid , primarily from their own laboratory . A uniform stretched - exponential concentration dependence exp ( − αc ν ) of D p was found . A dependence α ∼ M 0 . 8 ± 0 . 1 was noted over a range of matrix species . α for probes in BSA solutions complies with this dependence if BSA is assigned an eﬀective M corresponding to its radius . Phillies and Streletzky 5 presented in 2001 a short re - view ( 38 references ) of the literature on optical probe diﬀusion . They treat primarily systems studied with QELSS . In some cases D p follows the Stokes - Einstein equation evaluated using the solution viscosity . In other cases , diﬀusion is appreciably faster than would be ex - pected from the solution viscosity . In a few cases one ﬁnds re - entrant behavior in which the Stokes - Einstein 2 equation fails but only over a narrow band of concentra - tions . Finally ( taking probes in hydroxypropyl - cellulose as an examplar ) , in some cases the spectral mode struc - ture is too complicated to be characterized with a single diﬀusion coeﬃcient . Phillies and Streletzky’s review does not contact the microrheology literature . A series of reviews treat microrheology : Diﬀusing Wave Spectroscopy was reviewed ( 49 refer - ences ) by Harden and Viasnoﬀ 6 . The primary emphases are on two - cell light scattering measurements , in which light scattered by the sample of interest is rescattered by a second scattering cell before being collected , and on CCD methods , which allow one to collect simultaneously the light scattered into a substantial number of coherence areas . Solomon and Lu 7 review ( 54 references ) microrheology studies of probe diﬀusion in complex ﬂuids , in particular uses of the general Stokes - Einstein equation and its range of validity , correlations in the motion of pairs of large particles , data analysis methods , and possible paths for extending their methods to smaller probe particles . The reference list has very limited contact with the optical probe diﬀusion literature . MacKintosh and Schmidt 8 discuss ( 60 references ) stud - ies on the diﬀusion of microscopic probe particles through polymer solutions by means of particle tracking and dif - fusing wave spectroscopy , as performed under the cog - nomen microrheology , as well as studies of viscoelasticity using atomic force microscopy and the driven motion of mesoscopic particles . The excellent list of references lacks contact with the QELSS / FRAP - based optical probe dif - fusion literature . Mukhopadhay and Granick 9 review ( 41 references ) ex - perimental methods of driving and measuring the dis - placement of mesoscopic particles , such as DWS and op - tical tweezer techniques . They obtain the complex mod - ulus of the ﬂuid is via a generalized Stokes - Einstein equa - tion . The discussion and references do not contact the optical probe diﬀusion literature . Among reviews of particle tracking methods , note : Saxton and Jacobson 3 treat ( 105 references ) experi - mental methods for tracking single particles as they move in cell membranes . Motion of membrane proteins and other probes is complex , because the motion may be dif - fusive , obstructed , include nondiﬀusive convective mo - tion , or involve trapping . Correlations between single particle tracking and FRAP are considered , including the FRAP - determined nominal fraction of immobile parti - cles . Tseng , et al . 10 review ( 52 references ) particle tracking methods as applied to solutions of F - actin and other cy - toskeletal proteins . While mention is made of measuring mean - square displacements of diﬀusing particles , this is in the context of a technique that actually does measure particle positions and displacements . A review ( 56 references ) of microscopy techniques by Habdas and Weeks 11 emphasizes video microscopy , imag - ing crystals , glasses , and phase transitions , and measure - ment of particle interactions with laser tweezer methods . The focus is the application of these techniques to col - loidal particles in solution . II . THEORY UNDERLYING EXPERIMENTAL METHODS Many methods have been applied to study the mo - tion of mesoscopic probe particles through polymer so - lutions , including QELSS , FRS , FRAP , DWS , particle tracking , and interferometry . Optical probe methods re - fer to a special case of scattering from a general three - component probe : matrix polymer : solvent system . In the special case , one of the components , the probe , is dilute yet nonetheless dominates the scattering process , even though the other solute component , the matrix , may be far more concentrated than the probe . Most of these methods , in particular QELSS , FRS , and FRAP , have also been used to study motion of dilute labelled polymer chains in polymer solutions , leading to measurements of polymer self - and tracer - diﬀusion coeﬃcients . Light scattering spectroscopy is sensitive to the dy - namic structure factor S ( q , τ ) of the scattering parti - cles . The theoretical basis for applying QELSS , FRS , and FRAP to three - component solutions appears in our prior review 12 and need not be repeated here in detail . For dilute probe particles diﬀusing in a non - scattering matrix , S ( q , τ ) reduces to S ( q , τ ) = h N X i = 1 exp ( i q · ∆ r i ( τ ) ) i . ( 1 ) Here i labels the N probe particles whose locations at time t are the r i ( t ) . S ( q , τ ) is determined by the particle displacements ∆ r i ( τ ) = r i ( t + τ ) − r i ( t ) during τ . The scattering vector q , with q = 4 πn λ sin ( θ / 2 ) , ( 2 ) determines the distance a particle must diﬀuse to have a signiﬁcant eﬀect on S ( q , τ ) . Here n is the solution index of refraction , λ is the illuminating wavelength in vacuo , and θ is the scattering angle . In observing a polymer coil with QELSS , complications arise if the polymer coil ra - dius R g is comparable with q , because coil internal modes enter the spectrum if qR g is not ≪ 1 . However , the rigid probes considered here have no signiﬁcant internal modes , so light scattering spectroscopy measures rigid - probe center - of - mass motion regardless of qR g . For dilute monodisperse rigid probes in a simple New - tonian solvent , probe motion is described to good approx - imation by the Langevin equation . In this case , the dy - namic structure factor reduces to a simple exponential 13 S ( q , τ ) = exp ( − 2 D p q 2 τ ) ( 3 ) in which D p is the probe diﬀusion coeﬃcient . In one dimension , D p is related to particle displacement by h ( ∆ x ( τ ) ) 2 i = 2 D p τ . ( 4 ) 3 The Stokes - Einstein equation relates D p for spheres of radius R to other parameters , namely D p = k B T 6 πηR . ( 5 ) Here k B is Boltzmann’s constant , T is the absolute tem - perature , and η is the experimentally - measured macro - scopic solution viscosity . When D and R or η are known , this equation may be inverted to yield a microviscosity η µ or an apparent hydrodynamic radius r H , respectively , viz . r H = k B T 6 πηD p ( 6 ) and η µ = k B T 6 πRD p . ( 7 ) For probes in polymer solutions , η µ may diﬀer markedly from the macroscopically measured viscosity η , typically with η µ / η ≪ 1 . The r H may be much less than the experimentally - determined physical radius R . We denote η µ ≈ η and r H ≈ R as Stokes - Einsteinian behavior . The contrary case ( η µ 6 = η and r H 6 = R ) we describe as non - Stokes - Einsteinian behavior . In more complex systems , the dynamic structure fac - tor is non - exponential . S ( q , τ ) remains monotonic , with Laplace transform S ( q , τ ) = Z ∞ 0 d Γ A ( Γ ) exp ( − Γ t ) . ( 8 ) Here A ( Γ ) ≥ 0 is the relaxation distribution function . In some cases , A ( Γ ) is qualitatively well - described by a sum of relatively separated peaks , commonly termed ’modes’ . This terminology does not imply that there is necessarily a 1 - to - 1 correspondence between individual modes and individual physical relaxation processes , though such a correspondence often exists . An arbitrary physical A ( Γ ) can be generated by scat - tering light from an appropriately - chosen mixture of di - lute Brownian probes in a simple ﬂuid . For each Brown - ian species , the mean - square displacement increases lin - early in time . Correspondingly , every physical S ( q , τ ) corresponds to a system in which the mean - square par - ticle displacement increases linearly in time . However , a non - exponential S ( q , τ ) can also arise from systems in which h ∆ x ( τ ) ) 2 i has more complex behavior . It is im - possible to distinguish these possibilities by examining spectra taken at a single scattering angle or from spectra uniformly averaged over a range of q . Thus , it is impos - sible to determine h ( ∆ x ( τ ) ) 2 i from one light scattering spectrum of an unknown system . Recently , a misinterpretation of the historical litera - ture on light scattering spectra has emerged . The start - ing point is the excellent book of Berne and Pecora 13 , in particular their treatment of light scattering spectra of Brownian particles that follow the Langevin equation . Berne and Pecora’s treatment is without error , but the restrictions on the range of validity of their results are not uniformly recognized . The Langevin equation is a model for an isolated par - ticle ﬂoating in a simple solvent . The particle is as - sumed to be subject to two forces , namely a drag force F D ( t ) = − f v ( t ) and a ’random’ force F ( t ) . Here f is the drag coeﬃcient and v ( t ) is the time - dependent par - ticle velocity . The random force is uncorrelated with the drag force . Also , the random forces at any distinct pair of times are uncorrelated , i . e . , hF ( t ) · F ( t + τ ) i = 0 for τ 6 = 0 . The particle’s motion follows from Newton’s Sec - ond Law . The model only speciﬁes statistical properties of F ( t ) , so only statistical properties of particle displace - ments can be obtained from the Langevin model . Under these conditions , Doob 14 showed in 1942 that : ( i ) P ( ∆ r , τ ) is a Gaussian in ∆ r , with mean - square dis - placement in one dimension satisfying h ∆ x 2 ( t ) i = 2 Dt ; ( ii ) the spectrum reduces to S ( q , τ ) = exp ( − q 2 h ∆ x 2 ( t ) i ) ( 9 ) and ( iii ) as an absolutely rigorous mathematical conse - quence , S ( q , τ ) is a single exponential , namely S ( q , τ ) = exp ( − 2 D p q 2 t ) . These results describe , e . g . , the light scattering spectrum of dilute polystyrene spheres in pure water , which was an early target for experimental stud - ies . Spectra of probe particles in viscoelastic ﬂuids com - monly are not simple exponentials . In the litera - ture misinterpretation , eq . 9 is incorrectly claimed – under the cognomen ’gaussian assumption’ or ’gaussian approximation’ – to be uniformly applicable to light scat - tering spectra , in particular to spectra that do not show a single - exponential decay . Is this realistic ? In a viscoelas - tic liquid , the elastic moduli are frequency - dependent . Correspondingly , the stress ﬂuctuations in the liquid cre - ate random forces with non - zero correlation times , i . e . , hF ( t ) ·F ( t + τ ) i 6 = 0 for a range of τ 6 = 0 . Correspondingly , the displacement distribution function is not a Gaussian , and h ( ∆ x ( τ ) ) 2 i shows non - diﬀusive behavior ( ≁ t 1 ) that is not characterized by a diﬀusion coeﬃcient . A contra - positive statement of Doob’s theorem shows that non - exponential spectra correspond necessarily to particles whose motion is not described by eq . 9 . An explicit calculation that correctly expresses S ( q , τ ) in terms of all moments h ∆ x 2 n ( t ) i , n ≥ 1 , has been made 15 . S ( q , τ ) reﬂects all moments h ∆ x 2 n i of P ( ∆ r , τ ) . Except under special conditions not satisﬁed by probe particles in complex ﬂuids , the higher moments n > 1 make non - trivial contributions to S ( q , τ ) . S ( q , τ ) and QELSS single - and multiple - scattering spectra are in gen - eral not determined by h ∆ x 2 i . Equivalently , there are pairs of systems having the same S ( q , τ ) , but very diﬀer - ent time dependences for h ( ∆ x ) 2 i . Articles based on the gaussian approximation are considered in Section III . F . S ( q , τ ) is the spatial Fourier transform of the probabil - ity distribution P ( ∆ r , τ ) for ﬁnding a probe displacement 4 ∆ r during τ . While a single measurement of S ( q , τ ) can - not be used to compute P ( ∆ r , τ ) , determination of the complete functional dependence of S ( q , τ ) on q could in principle be used to determine P ( ∆ r , τ ) . To the authors knowledge , this has only been done in the trivial case of simple Brownian motion . Particle tracking methods yield directly P ( ∆ r , τ ) , and can be used to compute com - plex many - time displacement cross - correlations , such as P ( ∆ r ( t , t + τ ) , ∆ r ( t + τ , t + τ + θ ) ) , where ∆ r ( t , t + τ ) is the probe displacement between t and t + τ . These cross - correlations , which have not yet been intensively exploited , are substantially inaccessible to conventional light scattering spectroscopy . III . PHENOMENOLOGY This section describes experiments on the diﬀusion of rigid probes through polymer solutions and related sys - tems , and related measurements using other techniques , including particle tracking measurements and true mi - croscopic rheological measurements . The major subsec - tions of Section III are ( A ) probe diﬀusion in polymer solutions , ( A . 1 ) probe diﬀusion in hydroxypropylcellu - lose ( HPC ) solutions , ( B ) rotational diﬀusion of probes , ( C ) particle tracking methods , ( D ) true microrheological measurements , ( E ) probes in polyacrylamide gels , protein gels , and in vivo and in other structured systems , and ( F ) probe spectra interpreted with the gaussian displacement assumption . For simplicity , within each section descrip - tions of the primary literature are sorted alphabetically , except that studies on HPC : water are ordered chronolog - ically . Measurements on probes in solutions of rigid - rod polymers and in colloidal systems will be discussed else - where . In generating the results of this Section , experimental ﬁndings were taken from tabulated numbers in the origi - nal papers , or were recovered from the original papers by scanning original ﬁgures and digitizing the images . Fit - ting curves were generated by non - linear least - squares analysis based on the simplex method , leading to param - eters in Tables I - V and the smooth curves in the Figures . Figures were generated de novo from digitized numbers and our ﬁtting curves . Most smooth curves represent ﬁts to stretched exponentials in concentration , namely D p = D p 0 exp ( − αc ν ) . ( 10 ) Here ν is a scaling exponent , α is a scaling prefactor , and D p 0 reﬂect probe behavior at very low polymer concen - tration . A . Probe Diﬀusion in Polymer Solutions This section treats experiments that measured probe translational diﬀusion . Bremmell , et al . 16 used QELSS to examine the diﬀu - sion of positively - charged 34 nm and negatively - charged 10 - 7 10 - 6 10 - 5 10 - 4 10 - 3 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 c ( wt % ) 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 D p ( 10 - 8 c m 2 / s ) a 10 - 6 10 - 5 10 - 4 10 - 3 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 c ( wt % ) 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 D p ( 10 - 8 c m 2 / s ) b FIG . 1 : Fast and slow modes in spectra of ( a ) 100 nm sul - fate latex spheres in polyacrylamide solution , and ( b ) 33 nm hematite particles in sodium polyacrylate solutions , pH 10 , 0 . 1M NaNO 3 , both as functions of polymer concentration , after Bremmell , et al . 16 100 nm diameter polystyrene latex ( PSL ) spheres and 33 nm diameter hematite particles . Matrix solutions in - cluded water : glycerol , aqueous 3 Mda polyacrylamide ( PAAM ) , and aqueous high - molecular weight sodium polyacrylate ( NaPAA ) . Spectra were ﬁt to a sum of ex - ponentials . PSL spheres in water : glycerol showed single - exponential relaxations whose D scaled linearly with T / η as the temperature and glycerol concentration were var - ied . Polyacrylamide solutions show marked shear thin - ning . 5 10 - 3 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 c ( g / L ) 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 D p / D p0 FIG . 2 : Fast ( open points ) and slow ( ﬁlled points ) diﬀusion coeﬃcients of 100 nm polystyrene sulfate spheres in solutions of polyacrylic acid - co - acrylamide in the presence of 0 . 001 ( (cid:13) ) or 1 . 0 ( ♦ ) M NaNO 3 , from data of Bremmell and Dunstan 17 . As seen in Figure 1 , in polyacrylamide solutions : Ex - cept at very low polymer concentrations , PSL sphere spectra are bimodal , usefully characterized by fast and slow diﬀusion coeﬃcients D f and D s . With increasing polyacrylamide concentration , D s of the 200 nm spheres falls 30 - fold while η increases by only 20 - fold . D s does not depend strongly on q . D f shows re - entrance : it ﬁrst increases with increasing polymer c and then decreases to below its zero - c value . At elevated c , D f increases pro - foundly , and more rapidly than linearly , with increasing q 2 . With 68 nm spheres , D f at smaller c increases with increasing polymer c , though less than the increase with 200 nm spheres , while D s falls with increasing c . With hematite particles in sodium polyacrylate solutions , with concentrations increasing up to 1 wt % , D f and D s both increase , D f by ten - fold and D s by at least three - fold . Bremmell , et al . 16 refer to speculation that elasticity ( so - lution viscoelasticity ) is related to the observed hyperdif - fusivity . Bremmel and Dunstan 17 examined the diﬀusion of 100 nm radius PSL spheres in 3 MDa poly ( acrylic acid - co - acrylamide ) at a range of ionic strengths and poly - mer concentrations . Inverse Laplace transformation of QELSS spectra found a bimodal distribution of relax - ation rates . Figure 2 shows representative results from the smallest and largest ionic strengths examined . In 1 M NaNO 3 , D f and D s both increase with increasing c . In 0 . 001M NaNO 3 , D f shows re - entrant behavior , while D s simply decreases with increasing c . D f and D s both show a complex ionic - strength - dependent dependence on 0 10 20 30 c ( g / L ) 0 0 . 4 0 . 8 D p / D p0 FIG . 3 : D p of 160 nm silica spheres through solutions ( top to bottom ) of 101 , 163 , 268 , and 445 kDa PMMA , as obtained with QELSS by Brown and Rymden 19 , and ﬁts to stretched exponentials in c . q 2 . Brown and Rymden 18 used QELSS to examine the diﬀusion of PSL spheres through carboxymethylcellulose ( CMC ) solutions . The primary interest was to treat ad - sorption by this polymer to the latex spheres . Brown and Rymden conclude that CMC goes down on the surface in a relatively ﬂat conformation . CMC is a weak polyelec - trolyte . The extend of its binding to polystyrene latex is complexly inﬂuenced by factors including salt concentra - tion , pH , and probe size and surface chemistry . Brown and Rymden 19 used QELSS to determine the diﬀusion of 160 nm radius silica spheres and polystyrene random - coil - polymer fractions through poly - methylmethacrylate ( PMMA ) in CHCl 3 , as seen in Fig . 3 . They also measured the solution viscosity . PMMA molecular weights for the sphere diﬀusion study were 101 , 163 , 268 , and 445 kDa . QELSS spectra were uniformly quite close to single exponentials . For silica spheres , D p / D po was to good approximation a universal function of c [ η ] . The product D p η for spheres was independent from c , even though D p changes by three orders of mag - nitude over this concentration interval . For chain probes , D s η increases by a few to 70 % with increasing c , the in - crease in D s η increasing with increasing matrix molecu - lar weight . Brown and Rymden found that concentration dependence of the single particle diﬀusion coeﬃcient , for either chain or sphere probes , is to good accuracy given by a stretched exponential in polymer concentration . Bu and Russo 20 used FRAP to measure the diﬀusion of 55 nm PSL spheres , ﬂuorescein , and eight ﬂuores - cently labeled dextrans ( molecular weights 3 . 9 kDa to 6 2 MDa ) through HPC solutions . Nominal matrix molec - ular weights were 60 , 300 , and 1000 kDa . Detailed results were presented for the 300 kDa matrix as seen in Figure 4 . Probe particles diﬀused more rapidly than expected from the macroscopic solution viscosity , with η µ / η increasing toward 1 as the probe radius is increased . Comparison was made by Bu and Russo with the Langevin - Rondelez equation 21 , which describes this data well . D p ( c ) for each probe ﬁts well to a simple exponential , except for the largest probe for which more data appears needed . 0 10 20 30 40 c ( g / L ) 10 - 3 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 D p ( 10 - 7 c m 2 s - 1 ) FIG . 4 : D p of ﬂuorescein ( 0 . 5 nm ) , 1 . 3 , 1 . 7 , 2 . 8 , 4 . 5 , 5 . 8 , 8 . 8 , 13 . 3 , and 17 . 9 nm hydrodynamic radius dextrans , and 55 nm polystyrene spheres in aqueous 300 kDa HPC , as obtained with FRAP by Bu and Russo 20 , and ﬁts to exponentials in c . Busch , et al . 22 used FRAP to study diﬀusion of green ﬂuorescent protein ( GFP ) through glycerol , ﬁcoll , and 160 bp calf thymus DNA solutions . QELSS was used to measure the scattering spectrum of the DNA itself ; macroscopic viscosities were obtained using capillary vis - cometers . Representative measurements on DNA solu - tions appear as Figure 5 . In water : glycerol , the probes followed the Stokes - Einstein equation , as seen in Figure 6 . In ﬁcoll solutions the probes diﬀused moderately more rapidly than expected from the solution viscosity . In DNA solutions , at elevated c , D p of the GFP was much larger than expected from the solution viscosity . Cao , et al . 23 used QELSS to measure D p of 32 and 54 nm radius polystyrene spheres , phospholipid / cholesterol vesicles , and multilamellar vesicles diﬀusing in aqueous non - crosslinked 65 and 1000 kDa polyacrylamides . D p arose from a relaxation rate that was accurately linear in q 2 ; its concentration dependence was a stretched expo - nential in c . As seen in Figure 7 , comparison of D p with the solution ﬂuidity η − 1 ﬁnds that both polyacrylamides were more eﬀective at increasing the solution viscosity 0 20 40 60 80 100 c ( g / L ) 0 20 40 60 h ( c P ) 0 6 12 18 D p ( 10 - 7 c m 2 / s ) FIG . 5 : Viscosity of DNA solutions and D p of green ﬂuores - cent protein in those solutions , based on data of Busch , et al . 22 , and ﬁts to stretched exponentials in c . 0 50 100 150 200 250 c ( g / L ) 0 20 40 60 D p h ( F i ck - c P ) FIG . 6 : D p η of green ﬂuorescent protein 22 in solutions of glycerol ( (cid:13) ) , ﬁcoll 70 ( △ ) , and DNA ( ♦ ) , showing near - Stokes - Einstein behavior in glycerol and ﬁcoll 70 solutions , and large deviations from Stokes - Einstein behavior in DNA solutions . than at retarding probe diﬀusion of polystyrene latex spheres , and were more eﬀective at retarding the mo - tion of spheres than at retarding unilamellar vesicles of the same radius . The diﬀerence between the vesicle and sphere diﬀusive mobilities was interpreted as arising from the ﬂexibility of the vesicles .

The probes were labelled dextrans ( 20 , 40 , 70 , and 500 kDa ) , ovalbu - min , and 6th and 8th generation starburst dendrimers . PEO fractions had molecular weights 40 , 200 , and 600 kDa ; the guar had molecular weight 2MDa . D p of various probe : matrix combinations and η of one polymer solution were obtained . Figure 8 shows D p of 20 and 70 kDa dex - trans through 2 MDa guar solutions , the larger dextran being more eﬀectively retarded by the guar . Figures 9a and 9b compare the diﬀusion of ( a ) 20 kDa dextran and 0 . 1 1 10 c ( wt % ) 0 . 1 1 10 D p ( 10 - 7 c m 2 / s ) FIG . 8 : D p of 20 and 70 kDa dextrans in 2MDa aqueous guar solutions as functions of guar concentration , and simple - exponential ﬁts . The larger probe is more eﬀectively retarded by the solution , after Cheng , et al . 24 . ovalbumin in 40 kDa PEO , and ( b ) 70 kDa dextran and dendrimer G8 in 200 kDa PEO . For various probes , D p falls by factors of 5 to 30 over the observed concentration range . PEO is roughly equally eﬀective at retarding the diﬀusion of the 20 kDa dextran and ovalbumin , but is more eﬀective at retarding the diﬀusion of G8 dendrimer than at retarding the motion of 70 kDa dextran , even though G8 dendrimer and 70 kDa dextran have the same D p 0 . De Smedt , et al . 25 used FRAP to examine diﬀusion of ﬂuorescein - labelled dextrans and polystyrene latex spheres through hyaluronic acid solutions . Dextrans had molecular weights 71 , 148 , and 487 kDa . The hyaluronic acid had M n and M w of 390 and 680 kDa . The dex - tran diﬀusion coeﬃcients depend on matrix polymer c as stretched exponentials in c , as seen in Figure 10 . Hyaluronic acid solutions are somewhat more eﬀective at retarding the larger dextran probes . Viscosities for these solutions were reported by De Smedt , et al . 26 . The concentration dependence of η is stronger than the con - centration dependence of D p of the polystyrene spheres , which is in turn stronger than the concentration depen - dence of D p of the dextrans . Spheres and dextrans both diﬀuse more rapidly expected from the solution viscosity and the Stokes - Einstein equation . De Smedt , et al . 27 used confocal laser scanning mi - croscopy ( CSLM ) and FRAP to study the diﬀusion of ﬂuorescein - labelled dextran molecules ( 19 ≤ M w ≤ 487 kDa ) through dextran - methacrylate , comparing D p of probes in solutions with probes in swollen and relaxed cross - linked gels .

All probes diﬀuse more rapidly than expected from the solution viscosity . The larger probes are slightly more eﬀectively retarded by the solution . The concentration dependence of D p approaches the concen - tration dependence of η more closely as the molecular weight of the probes is increased .

Swelling a gel increased D p , but only at lower levels of gel crosslinking . Delﬁno , et al . 28 used QELSS to study probes in aque - ous solutions of carboxymethylcellulose , nominal molec - ular weight 700 kDa , at concentrations 0 . 2 - 11 . 7 g / L . 9 0 4 8 12 c ( g / L ) 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 D p / D p0 a 0 4 8 12 c ( g / L ) 10 - 4 10 - 3 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 D p / D p0 b FIG . 12 : Fast ( (cid:13) ) and slow ( ♦ ) mode D p / D p 0 for ( a ) 14 , ( b ) 47 and ( c ) 102 nm polystyrene sphere probes in aqueous 700 kDa carboxymethylcellulose , after Delﬁno , et al . 28 The probe particles were 14 , 47 , and 102 nm radius PSL spheres . Ubbelohde viscometers and a concentric - cylinder Couette viscometer were used to determine rhe - ological properties of the solutions . From the intrinsic viscosity [ η ] , the overlap concentration was c ∗ = 1 / [ η ] = 0 . 73 g / L , while from the linear slope of η SP , R g ≈ 50 nm was found . Probe spectra were ﬁt to an exponential or a sum of two pure exponentials , a fast mode and a slow mode . For the 14 and 47 nm probes , spectra were unimodal at smaller c and bimodal at larger c . With 14 nm probes , the fast mode dominated at all concentra - tions . For the 47 nm probes , the fast mode dominated 0 2 4 6 8 10 c ( g / L ) 10 - 3 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 D p / D p0 c the spectrum at small c and the slow mode dominated at large c , while for the 102 nm probes , the slow mode always dominated . As seen in Figure 12 , except for the slow mode of the largest spheres , which show a weakly stretched - exponential concentration dependence , D p of either mode falls approximately exponentially with in - creasing polymer c . Increasing c is more eﬀective at re - tarding the relaxation of the slow mode than at retarding the relaxation of the fast mode . Increasing c is more ef - fective at retarding the motion of the larger 47 and 102 nm spheres than at retarding the motion of the small 14nm spheres . Dunstan and Stokes 29 employ QELSS to measure diﬀu - sion of PSL spheres through glycerol and polyacrylamide solutions . In glycerol - water , D p tracked the solution vis - cosity . In polyacrylamide solutions , spectra were ﬁt to a sum of two exponentials . For 100 nm radius sulfate - modiﬁed spheres : D s of the slow exponential fell with increasing polymer c . D f of the fast exponential showed re - entrant behavior , with a maximum in D f at an inter - mediate polymer concentration considerably larger than the overlap concentration , followed at still larger concen - trations by a decline until D f was less than a third of its zero - concentration value . η µ from the slow exponential is greater than η from macroscopic measurements , while η µ from the fast relaxation is less than η . D s is substan - tially independent from q , while D f of probes in more concentrated polyacrylamide solutions increases strongly with increasing q . More limited measurements on 34 nm radius amidine - modiﬁed spheres appear to yield the same pattern of concentration dependences for D s and D f . Furukawa , et al . 30 used FRAP to measure the diﬀu - sion of 19 nm radius polystyrene spheres , 40 and 150 kDa dextran , and ﬂuorescein dye through dextran matrix so - lutions having 40 ≤ M w ≤ 2000 kDa and concentrations up to 300 or 600 g / L .

Figure 13 . In 40 kDa dextran solutions , probes other than ﬂuorescein diﬀuse at very nearly the rate expected from the solution viscosity . In solutions of 150 kDa dextran , all probes diﬀuse more rapidly than expected from the solution vis - cosity , but ( cf . Figure 14a ) , with increasing probe size η µ tends toward the macroscopic η . Gold , et al . 31 studied the diﬀusion of highly cross - linked polystyrene latex spheres through solutions of 0 200 400 600 c ( g / L ) 1 10 100 h m / h 0 a 0 100 200 300 c ( g / L ) 1 10 100 h m / h 0 b FIG . 14 : η / η 0 for viscosity from macroscopic measurements ( ◦ ) and η µ / η 0 from probe diﬀusion using 20 nm radius polystyrene latex sphere ( N ) , 150 kDa dextran ( (cid:4) ) , 40 kDa dextran ( (cid:3) ) , and ﬂuorescein ( • ) probes in ( a ) 40 and ( b ) 150 kDa dextrans , after Furukawa , et al . 30 , and ﬁts to stretched exponentials in c . 350 kDa polymethylmethacrylate in the good solvents tetrahydrofuran ( THF ) and N , N - dimethylformamide ( DMF ) , and the theta solvent ( at 25 o C ) dioxane : water . Spectra were analyzed with Laplace inversion . For probes in good solvents , cumulant analysis was also applied . In good solvents , a unimodal decay distribution was ob - served . Under Laplace inversion , spectra of probes in dioxane - water often showed a bimodal distribution of de - cay rates . With dioxane : water as the solvent : The slow 11 mode increased as the sample aged . The amplitude of the slow mode varied from small up to equal to the amplitude of the fast mode . The slow mode was more prominent at low angles . Further analysis was based primarily on the relaxation rate of the fast mode . Diﬀusion coeﬃcients were inferred from slopes of Γ against q 2 , with typical standard errors in the slope of 1 − 10 % leading to results of Figure 15 . For probes in THF and DMF , diﬀusion is more rapid than expected from the solution viscosities and the Stokes - Einstein equation , the Stokes - Einstein equa - tion failing by 50 % or a factor of 2 at elevated polymer concentration . For probes in dioxane : water , probe mo - tion was slower than anticipated from the Stokes - Einstein equation , an eﬀect attributed by Gold , et al . to polymer adsorption by the probe spheres . Gorti and Ware 32 made an extensive study of probe diﬀusion in polyelectrolyte solutions , using FRAP as the primary method , as seen in ﬁgure 16 . Probe par - ticles included ﬂuorescein , 19 nm radius polystyrene spheres , and bovine serum albumin . The matrix poly - mers were 70 and 500 kDa polystyrene sulphonates . So - lution viscosities were obtained using Ubbelohde vis - cometers . The dependence of D p on polymer concen - tration , molecular weight , degree of neutralization , solu - tion ionic strength , and probe size was observed . Poly - mer solutions were more eﬀective at retarding the diﬀu - sion of larger probes . At ﬁxed polymer concentration , probe diﬀusion was slowed by increasing the polymer molecular weight . Measurements covered both the nom - inal dilute and the nominal semidilute regimes . At low ionic strength , polystyrene sulphonate solutions experi - ence an ordinary - extraordinary transition in their QELSS spectra 33 . For the 1 and 5 mM salt solutions , the tran - sitions occur at 2 and 11 g / L PSS . Probe diﬀusion mea - surements taken above and below the transition appear to lie on the same line ; the ordinary - extraordinary transi - tion does not aﬀect the probe diﬀusion coeﬃcient . Also , D p does not track the solution ﬂuidity η − 1 . Solution ionic strength has a modest eﬀect on D p , an increase in I tending to reduce D p , as seen in Figure 17 . An early application of probe diﬀusion was presented by Jamieson , et al . 34 , who in the course of reporting on 2 . 2 MDa xanthan in water , giving measurements of ﬂow birefringence , light scattering spectra , and shear viscos - ity , also report limited measurements of D p of 100 nm polystyrene spheres as polymer c is increased . D p fell more than thirty - fold over the allowed range of concen - trations , though only for a few data points was D p sig - niﬁcantly less than D o . At the highest concentrations studied , η / η 0 attained values as large as 10 4 . The micro - viscosity η µ inferred from D p was thus as much as two orders of magnitude less than η . Johanssson , et al . 35 examined the diﬀusion of low - molecular - weight ( 0 . 3 - 4 kDa ) poly - ethylene glycol frac - tions in κ - carrageenan crosslinked gels and in solutions of 500 kDa sodium polystyrene sulphonate . The probes were radioactively labelled ; boundary spreading was used to determine D p of dilute probes .

Johansson , et al . also found that the eﬀect of a ﬁxed concentration of polystyrene sulphonate on probe diﬀu - sion decreases with increasing ionic strength . They pro - posed that this diﬀerence arises because relatively rigid polymers are more able to aﬀect probe motion than are ﬂexible polymers .

The block copolymer was a 74 kDa Kraton G - 1650 polystyrene - hydrogenated polybutadiene - polystyrene that forms 4 . 8 MDa 23 nm radius micelles . The matrix polymers were 110 and 200 kDa polystyrenes having M w / M n = 1 . 4 . The mi - celle diﬀusion coeﬃcient D p and the viscosity η were reported . At intermediate polystyrene concentrations , D p was larger than expected from η and D o , but at the largest c examined D p η returned to its low - concentration value . The largest - c re - entrant behavior was only ob - served at a single point , so it is impossible to say whether D p η / D p 0 η 0 ≈ 1 represents the general largest - matrix - concentration behavior , or whether at concentrations larger than those studied D p is smaller than expected from η . In a series of three papers , Lin and Phillies 37 , 38 , 39 de - termine diﬀusion of polystyrene spheres through aque - ous solutions of non - neutralized poly - acrylic acid ( PAA ) . Lin and Phillies 37 report on the diﬀusion of nominal 38 nm carboxylate - modiﬁed spheres in solutions of 300 kDa PAA at polymer concentrations 0 . 37 ≤ c ≤ 171 g / L . They measured D p as a function of temperature at 11 polymer concentrations and η of PAA solutions at various polymer concentrations . At each polymer concentration D p tracked T / η with reasonable accuracy . These prelimi - nary measurements were extended in a further study . Lin and Phillies 38 compared the diﬀusion of probe spheres ( radii 20 . 4 - 1500 nm ) in 300 kDa PAA , for solution con - centrations 0 . 0113 - 145 g / L . As seen in Figure 19 , in each solution D p / D po fell markedly , for large spheres by as much as three orders of magnitude , with increasing poly - 0 5 10 15 20 c ( g / L ) 0 . 01 0 . 1 1 D p / D p0 FIG . 17 : D p of 19 nm radius PSL in 500 kDa aqueous polystyrene sulfonate solutions at various ionic strengths : 0 . 001 ( (cid:13) ) , 0 . 005 ( (cid:3) ) , 0 . 01 ( △ ) , 0 . 02 ( + ) , and 0 . 05 ( ♦ ) M phosphate ion , and ﬁts of D p to stretched exponentials in c , after Gorti and Ware 32 . 0 20 40 60 80 c ( g / L ) 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 D p ( 10 - 8 c m 2 / s ) FIG . 18 : D p of 23 nm radius Kraton G - 1650 micelles in so - lutions of 110 ( (cid:13) ) and 200 ( (cid:3) ) kDa polystyrenes in dioxane , after data of Konak , et al . 36 . mer concentration . For each sphere size , D p ( c ) has a stretched - exponential concentration dependence . The apparent hydrodynamic radius r H ( Figure 19 ) of the smaller spheres grew modestly with increasing poly - mer concentration , r H of the largest spheres fell , and r H of intermediate spheres is nearly independent from c . 13 10 - 4 10 - 3 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 D p / D p0 0 . 01 0 . 1 1 10 100 c ( g / L ) 0 50 100 150 c ( g / L ) 10 100 1000 r h ( n m ) FIG . 19 : D p / D p 0 and r h of 20 ( (cid:13) ) , 80 ( (cid:3) ) , 620 ( ♦ ) and 1500 ( △ ) nm radius spheres in aqueous 300 kDa non - neutralized polyacrylic acid , after Lin and Phillies 38 . D p / D p 0 → 1 at small c ; data and ﬁts were shifted vertically for clarity . Lin and Phillies interpreted their results as arising from polymer adsorption ( to form a layer 10 - 20 nm thick ) on the spheres , coupled with a failure of the Stokes - Einstein equation ( spheres diﬀuse faster than expected from the solution viscosity ) , especially for the larger spheres . Finally , Lin and Phillies 39 examined the diﬀusion of 20 . 4 , 80 , 620 , and 1500 nm radius carboxylate - modiﬁed polystyrene spheres in solutions of 50 kDa and 1 MDa polyacrylic acid . They also measured the macroscopic so - lution viscosity η .

In 50 kDa ( Figure 20a ) and 1 MDa PAA ( Figure 20b ) , D p ( c ) for each probe size fol - lows a stretched exponential in c . In 50 kDa PAA solu - tions , D p and η are related by the Stokes - Einstein equa - tion . D p in 1 MDa HPC solutions does not show Stokes - Einsteinian behavior . D p η / D po η o increases by four or - ders of magnitude with increasing c , as seen in Figure 21 . 14 Extended searches of the spectrum on the time scale on which the spectrum would have decayed , if the Stokes - Einstein equation were correct , found no sign of a spec - tral relaxation ; the spectrum had already decayed to the baseline . Lin and Phillies proposed that that the discrep - ancy between D p and the macroscopic η arises from shear thinning in the probe diﬀusion process , namely the micro - viscosity found on the time and distance scales probed by the polystyrene spheres is far less than the macroscopic viscosity η . In 50 kDa HPC , the second cumulant of S ( q , t ) was substantially independent of c . In 1 MDa PAA , the spec - tral second cumulant was nearly constant for c < c + , but at c > 1 . 2 g / L ( for the 620 nm spheres ) or c > 2 . 5 g / l ( for the smaller spheres ) the second cumulant increased substantially . This very early work was done with a 64 - channel linear correlator ; it was apparent that at large c the lineshape was changing dramatically , but revela - tion of the details had to wait for more modern instru - mentation . The near - simultaneous changes at c + in the functional form of η ( c ) and in the qualitative probe line - shape represent the ﬁrst observations of the solutionlike – meltlike viscosity transition and a spectral correlate . 0 4 8 12 16 20 c ( g / L ) r h ( n m ) 0 . 001 0 . 01 0 . 1 1 10 100 1000 FIG . 21 : Hydrodynamic radius of 20 ( (cid:13) ) , 80 ( (cid:3) ) , and 620 ( ♦ ) nm radius spheres in aqueous 1 MDa polyacrylic acid , after Lin and Phillies 39 . Lin 40 used QELSS to study diﬀusion of 155 and 170 nm nominal radius titania spheres as probe particles in a melt of 7500 Da polyethylene oxide , at temperatures from 85 to 160 C . Over this temperature range , D p changes by nearly two orders of magnitude . Comparison was made with the shear - dependent viscosity obtained using a cone - and - plate viscometer . The observed microviscosities were substantially less than the measured viscosity . An ex - trapolation procedure based on the apparent activation energy inferred from the temperature dependence of η was used to estimate an eﬀective shear rate for probe dif - fusion ≥ 10 4 s − 1 , corresponding via ˙ γ ∼ D / L 2 to probe diﬀusion over atomic distances . Diﬀusion over an atomic distance is rationally fundamental if one supposes that the basic unit step for probe diﬀusion in this system cor - responds to the displacement of a single layer of polymer chains lying along the probe surfaces . Mangenot , et al . 41 used FCS to measure diﬀusion of nucleosome core particles ( NCP ) in water and DNA so - lutions . Manipulation of the solution ionic strength was shown to change the size of the core particles . The parti - cles’ surface structure can be manipulated via trypsiniza - tion , which removes the histone tails that are ordinarily wrapped about the particles . The diﬀusion of trypsinized NCP is reduced by increasing DNA concentration but is almost independent of salt concentration . In contrast , the histone tails of nontrypsinized particles unfold at ele - vated ionic strength , changing the particles’ interactions with DNA in solution , so D p of nontrypsinized particles in DNA solutions is sensitive to both salt and DNA con - centrations . Nehme , et al . 42 used QELSS and ultracentrifugation to study the motion of 49 and 80 nm radius probe par - ticles in poly - L - lysine ( 52 ≤ M w ≤ 353 kDa ) solutions , leading to Figure 22 . In most of these experiments , the probe particles were somewhat or substantially larger than the nominal polymer solution mesh size ξ . For the smaller probes and the less concentrated larger poly - mers , at small c the probe R was comparable to ξ . From the ultracentrifuge experiments , the polymer solutions are approximately equally eﬀective at retarding the sed - imentation of smaller and larger probes . For the larger probes , D p / D o and s o / s have nearly the same concen - tration dependences ; the polymers retard sedimentation and probe diﬀusion to approximately the same extent . For the smaller probes , the polymers may be more eﬀec - tive at retarding probe diﬀusion than at retarding probe sedimentation , though only for a few concentrations is the eﬀect large . Nehme , et al . , interpreted this behavior as a time scale eﬀect : When probe motion is adequately rapid , the poly - mer is less able to move out of the way of the probes . The sedimentation coeﬃcients came close to being a univer - sal function of the overlap concentration c ∗ . Polymer adsorption in this system is substantial ; the thickness of the adsorbed polymer layer on each probe was estimated as 20 nm .

Figure 23b shows D p and ﬁts to stretched exponentials in c . At larger scattering angles , a second , much faster relaxation interpreted as polymer scattering was found .

Phillies 44 reports on the diﬀusion of bovine serum albu - min through solutions of 100 kDa and 300 kDa polyethy - lene oxides . D p depended measurably on the probe con - centration . At elevated polymer c and low protein con - centration , D p was as much as a third faster than ex - pected from the c - dependent solution ﬂuidity η − 1 . With increasing protein concentration , D p fell toward values expected from the macroscopic η − 1 . This study pushed the technical limits of then - current light - scattering in - strumentation . Phillies , et al . 45 observed probe diﬀusion in aqueous dextran . Dextran concentrations covered 0 ≤ c ≤ 250 g / L , using 9 diﬀerent dextran samples . Probes were polystyrene spheres with radii 21 and 230 nm ; solution viscosities were obtained using thermostatted capillary viscometers . Multiple tests conﬁrmed that probe scat - tering completely dominated matrix polymer scattering . Representative measurements of D p and η for two poly - mer molecular weights appear in Fig . 25 , together with ﬁts to stretched exponentials in c . Except for the smaller spheres in solutions of the very largest dextran , Stokes - Einsteinian behavior was uniformly observed , D p and η − 1 having very nearly the same concentration depen - dences exp ( − αc ν ) .

In Ref . 46 , Phillies , et al . examined probes ( 19 ≤ R ≤ 380 nm ) diﬀusing through aqueous non - neutralized and neutralized low - molecular - weight ( 5 ≤ M ≤ 470 kDa ) poly - acrylic acid . The parameter space is quite large , with possible eﬀects of concentration , molecular weight , and degree of neutralization , to to mention solution ionic strength . Phillies , et al . 46 were only able to sample the behaviors encountered in these systems . In 2 / 3 neutralized 5 kDa PAA , D / D 0 fell exponentially with increasing polymer concentration , but was indepen - dent of salt concentration ( 0 ≤ I ≤ 0 . 1 M NaCl ) and very nearly independent of probe radius . Probes in 150 kDa PAA showed a more complex dependence on these parameters : For polymer concentrations 0 . 1 - 20 g / L , D p was relatively independent from I for at higher salt con - centrations ( I ≥ 0 . 01 M ) , but fell by a third to two - thirds as I was reduced from 0 . 01 M toward zero added salt , the decline being larger at elevated polymer con - centration . Probes in largely - neutralized 150 kDa have stretched - exponential dependences on polymer c to good accuracy , for concentrations out to 10 g / L and D / D o as small as 0 . 25 , except that at very low ( c ≤ 0 . 2 g / L ) polymer concentration D p is larger than expected from a ﬁt of a stretched exponential exp ( − αc ν ) to the higher - concentration measurements . Careful analysis revealed that at very low concentrations D p = D p 0 ( 1 − ac 1 / 2 ) and similarly for η . Also , the non - Stokes - Einsteinian behav - iors found by Lin and Phillies 37 , 38 , 39 in non - neutralized PAA are also seen in partially - neutralized PAAs . 17 0 1 2 3 4 5 c ( g / L ) 0 0 . 4 0 . 8 1 . 2 D p ( 10 - 7 c m 2 / s ) FIG . 26 : D p of 20 nm radius probes in 596 kDa PAA , 60 % neutralized , at ionic strengths 0 ( • ) , 0 . 01 ( (cid:13) ) , 0 . 02 ( (cid:3) ) , and 0 . 1 ( + ) M , after Phillies , et al . 47 , and ﬁts to stretched exponentials ( lines ) . In a separate study , Phillies , et al . 47 examined the dif - fusion of 21 , 52 , 322 , and 655 nm radius carboxylate - modiﬁed polystyrene spheres through 596 kDa M w partially - neutralized poly - acrylic acid , using light scat - tering to determine D p . The dependences of D p and the solution viscosity on c , solution ionic strength I ( 0 ≤ I ≤ 0 . 1 M ) , and fractional neutralization A of the polymer ( 0 . 6 ≤ A ≤ 1 ) were determined . D p has a stretched - exponential dependence on c ( Figure 26 ) and a stretched - exponential dependence exp ( − aI β ) on I for β < 0 . Probes generally diﬀuse faster than predicted by the Stokes - Einstein equation , the prediction of the Stokes - Einstein equation being approached more nearly with lower polymer neutralization , larger solvent ionic strength , and larger probes . The dependence of the ap - parent hydrodynamic radius of the probes on solution pH ( and , implicitly , polymer neutralization ) is much more pronounced for the smaller 21 and 52 nm spheres than for the larger 322 and 655 nm spheres . If one believed that the diﬀusion of probe particles , whose sizes exceed all of the length scales of the polymer solution , were gov - erned by the macroscopic viscosity , then for this large - M polymer the longest length scale is at least 52 nm and perhaps larger than 322 nm . Phillies , et al . 48 examined polystyrene spheres , radii 7 , 34 , and 95 nm , diﬀusing through aqueous polystyrene sulfonate . The purpose of the experiments was to de - termine the initial slope α of D p against polymer c for various polymer M . Polymers had 7 molecular weights with 1 . 5 ≤ M w ≤ 1188 kDa . To minimize low - salt poly - electrolyte anomalies , the solvent included 0 . 2 M NaCl . 0 0 . 04 0 . 08 0 . 12 I ( M ) 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 D p ( 10 - 7 c m 2 / s ) FIG . 27 : D p of 20 nm probes in 1 g / L 596 kDa PAA , at neutralizations 60 % ( ◦ ) , 85 % ( × ) , and 100 % ( • ) , as functions of ionic strength I , and ﬁts to stretched exponentials in I , after Phillies , et al . 47 . Carboxylate - modiﬁed polystyrene spheres are charge - stabilized . To prevent aggregation on the time scale of the experiments , the solvent included 1 mM NaOh and 0 . 1 or 0 . 32 g / L sodium dodecyl sulfate . Figure 28 shows representative data , namely D p for each sphere size in 178 and 1188 kDa polystyrene sulfonate , and ﬁts to sim - ple exponentials in c . These results are interpreted below . Phillies , et al . 50 , 51 , 52 report studies of the temperature dependence of probe diﬀusion through various polymer solutions . These studies constitute a response to a cri - tique , made to the author at several conferences , of us - ing the stretched - exponential concentration dependence . Critics complained that data had not been ”reduced rel - ative to the glass temperature” . To examine this issue , Phillies , et al . 50 , 51 , 52 measured η and D p for probes in various solutions at a series of temperatures . The sys - tems studied included ( i ) 20 . 4 nm radius carboxylate - modiﬁed polystyrene sphere probes in 2 / 3 neutralized low - molecular - weight 5 and 150 kDa poly - acrylic acid with and without added 0 . 1 M NaCl 50 , ( ii ) the same probes in 2 / 3 neutralized intermediate - molecular - weight 596 kDa poly - acrylic acid 51 with or without added 0 . 1 M NaCL or added surfactant , and ( iii ) 34 nm nominal radius polystyrene spheres in solutions of dextrans hav - ing 11 . 8 ≤ M w ≤ 542 kDa 52 . Polymer concentrations reached 100 , 45 , or 20 g / L , respectively , for the three poly - acrylic acids and 300 g / L for the dextrans . For probes 50 in solutions of low - molecular weight poly - acrylic acid , the temperature dependence of of D p seen in Figure 29 is entirely explained by the temperature de - pendence of the solvent viscosity η s and Walden’s rule 18 0 4 8 12 16 20 c ( g / L ) 0 . 1 1 D p ( 10 - 7 c m 2 / s ) FIG . 28 : D p of 7 ( △ ) , 34 ( ♦ ) , and 95 ( (cid:13) ) nm radius polystyrene spheres in solutions of 178 ( open points ) and 1188 ( ﬁlled points ) kDa polystyrene sulfonate , and ﬁts to simple exponentials in c , after Phillies , et al . 48 . D p ∼ T / η s . Furthermore , at each polymer concentra - tion η / η s is very nearly independent from T . This result includes data for 2 - 65 o C and fourteen polymer concen - trations at two polymer molecular weights . There was no residual temperature dependence of D p to be explained by glass temperature issues . The notion that D p is sen - sitive to T − T g other than through η s is rejected by this data . On the other hand , if hydrodynamic interactions between the polymer chains and the probes were primar - ily responsible for controlling D p , it would be reasonable for D p ( T ) to depend linearly on the solvent viscosity , as is observed . Note that the chain monomer mobility is also reasonable expected to scale linearly with η s , so the observations of Reference 50 are equally consistent with reptation - type dynamic models . In ref . 51 , Phillies , et al . examined probe diﬀusion through solutions of intermediate - molecular - weight poly - acrylic acid , comparing the temperature dependence of η and D p with Walden’s rule and with the Vogel - Fulcher - Tamman equation . For the solution viscosity , this equa - tion is η = η 0 exp ( − B T − T g ) . ( 11 ) Here η 0 , B , and T g are material - dependent parameters ; B is sometimes replaced with ¯ BT g . Walden’s rule was fol - lowed accurately by all of these data . The VFT equation uniformly describes the temperature dependence of the measurements accurately . Fits of measurements covering all c studied to eq . 11 , using the same T g but diﬀerent B at diﬀerent c , gave excellent results as seen in Figure 30 . 0 200 400 600 800 T / h ( K / cP ) 0 1 2 3 D p ( 10 - 7 c m 2 / s ) FIG . 29 : D p of 20 nm radius probes as a function of T / η in 2 / 3 neutralized 5kDa polyacrylic acid at polymer concentrations 0 ( ◦ ) , 5 ( (cid:3) ) , 25 ( • ) , 50 ( △ ) , and 100 ( N ) g / L , and linear ﬁts at each c showing simple Walden’s rule behavior , after Phillies , et al . 50 . These data thus reject the possibility of adjusting D p at diﬀerent c for a hypothesized variation in T − T g with c . Separately , Phillies , et al . 51 also ﬁt their data at each polymer concentration to D p = D p 0 ( 1 + A 1 T η + A 2 ( T η ) 2 + . . . ) , ( 12 ) both with A 2 = 0 forced and with A 2 as an additional free parameter . Adding A 2 as a further free parameter had no eﬀect on the RMS error in the ﬁts , indicating that there was no non - linear dependence of D p on T / η . Phillies , et al . conclude that their data were consistent with hy - drodynamic models in which solvent - mediated forces are the dominant forces between polymer chains , and were equally consistent with reptation - type models in which the solvent viscosity determines the monomer friction constant . Phillies and Quinlan 52 used light scattering spec - troscopy to obtain the T - dependence of D p of 34 nm radius carboxylate - modiﬁed polystyrene spheres in solu - tions of various dextran fractions , 11 . 8 ≤ M w ≤ 542 kDa at concentrations up to 300 g / L . Solution viscosities were also measured . Representative measurements appear in Figure 31 . Measurements of D p were ﬁt to a modiﬁed Vogel - Fulcher - Tamman equation D p = D p 0 T exp ( − B T − T g ) . ( 13 ) and to eq 12 . A very weak deviation from Walden’s rule was observed , D p increasing with increasing T faster than 19 0 20 40 60 T ( C ) 0 0 . 5 1 1 . 5 2 D p ( 10 - 7 c m 2 / s ) FIG . 30 : D p of 20 nm radius probes as a function of T in 2 / 3 neutralized 596 kDa polyacrylic acid : 0 . 1 M NaCl : 0 . 1 wt % Triton X - 100 at concentrations 0 ( ◦ ) , 3 ( (cid:3) ) , 6 ( △ ) , 8 ( ♦ ) , and 15 ( ▽ ) g / L and ﬁts at each c to the Vogel - Fulcher - Tamman equation using the same T g at every c , after Phillies , et al . 51 . expected from the viscosity . The deviations , which are at most twice the random scatter in the measurements , increase with increasing c but are independent of M w . Phillies and Quinlan note that the deviations are consis - tent with a slight change in solvent quality with increas - ing dextran monomer concentration . Equation 13 , with T g the same for all solutions , ﬁts almost all measurements to within 2 % rms error . The apparent glass temperature of water : dextran solutions , as inferred from the modi - ﬁed VFT equation , is independent of dextran molecular weight and dextran concentration . The measurements here serve to exclude any hypothesis that the strong con - centration dependence of D p arises from a strong concen - tration dependence of T g , namely ( i ) T g is independent of c , and , alternatively , ( ii ) after removing the temper - ature dependence of η s , there is next - to - no remnant T - dependence of D p available to be interpreted as a varia - tion in T − T g . Roberts , et al . 53 used PFGNMR to examined a model liquid ﬁlled - polymer system , formed from silica nanopar - ticles suspended in monodisperse poly ( dimethylsiloxane ) . Silica particles had diameters 0 . 35 and 2 . 2nm ; polymers had molecular weights 5 . 2 and 12 . 2 kDa , with M w / M n of 1 . 07 and 1 . 03 , respectively . These are actually not probe measurements ; the volume fractions of probes and ma - trix polymers were both always substantial . D s of the small silica particles and the 5 . 2 kDa polymer in a mix - ture both fall linearly with increasing polymer volume fraction for polymer volume fraction φ in the range 0 . 2 to 0 . 95 .

Shibayama , et al . 54 examine the diﬀu - sion of polystyrene probe particles in poly ( N - isopropylacrylamide ) gels and solutions using QELSS . The solution spectra are bimodal , with both relax - ation rates scaling linearly in q 2 . A faster , relatively concentration - independent mode corresponds to motion of the polymer chains , while a slower mode corresponds to probe diﬀusion . As a result of the preparation method , solutions at each concentration involved polymers having a diﬀerent average molecular weight . Over the observed range of polymer concentrations , a reduced probe diﬀusion coeﬃcient D p / M 0 . 6 changed by several orders of magnitude . Shibayama , et al . propose that the probe diﬀusion coeﬃcient should scale with concentration and polymer molecular weight as D p / D po ∼ ( c / c ∗ ) − 1 . 75 , based on the corresponding prediction in Shiwa 55 for polymer self - diﬀusion . Spectra of probes in true crosslinked gels were also bimodal , but with increasing crosslinker concentration the amplitude of the probe mode is suppressed to zero . Turner and Hallett 1 used QELSS to measure the diﬀu - sion of carboxylated styrene butadiene spheres , diameters 93 , 183 , 246 nm , in solutions of dextrans having nomi - nal molecular weights 20 , 70 , 150 , 500 , and 2000 kDa at polymer concentrations up to 20 g / l . As seen in Fig - ure 32 , the normalized diﬀusion coeﬃcient D p / D po was very nearly insensitive to probe diameter , but changed more than three - fold as polymer concentration c was in - creased . To good approximation , D p / D po = exp ( − ac ) .

The microvis - cosity inferred from D p agreed well with the viscosity measured with a rotating drum viscometer . Ullmann and Phillies 56 made a study of the diﬀusion of polystyrene latex spheres through polyethylene oxide : water . These data are discussed with the following pa - per . They used the macroscopic η to compute eﬀective hydrodynamic radii for their PSL sphere probes ( radii 21 - 655 nm ) , ﬁnding that r h had a complex dependence on polymer concentration . Addition of 0 . 01 % of the non - ionic surfactant Triton X - 100 , which suppresses polymer binding , eliminated the complexity . Probe spheres in surfactant - containing mixtures showed a much simpler behavior , namely the apparent hydrodynamic radii of the probes fell smoothly with increasing polymer c . The de - gree of failure of the Stokes - Einstein equation increased markedly with increasing probe radius . By using mea - surements on probes in PEO : Triton X - 100 to supply cal - ibrating factors , Ullmann and Phillies quantitated the substantial degree of polymer adsorption by probes in surfactant - free solutions . 0 . 1 1 10 100 1000 c ( g / L ) 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 h ( c P ) FIG . 33 : η of aqueous 7 . 5 ( △ ) , 18 . 5 ( • ) , 100 ( (cid:3) ) , and 300 ( (cid:13) ) kDa PEO and stretched - exponential ﬁts , after Ullmann , et al . 57 . Ullmann , et al . 57 extended Ullmann and Phillies 56 to study viscosity ( Figure 33 ) and diﬀusion ( Figure 34 ) of 20 . 8 , 51 . 7 , 322 , and 655 nm diameter carboxylate - modiﬁed PSL spheres in solutions of 7 . 5 , 18 . 5 , 100 , and 300 kDa polyethylene oxides . D p is substantially modi - ﬁed by the addition of Triton X - 100 , which is believed to suppress polymer binding by the spheres . D p fol - lows a stretched exponential in polymer concentration , except that 655 nm diameter spheres in the 18 . 5 kDa polymer show reentrant behavior , with D p ﬁrst climbing 50 % above D o and then declining markedly . The rela - tionship between D p and η is complex in the lower - M polymers ; at large M , D p follows a stretched exponen - tial in polymer concentration . D p / D o depends relatively weakly on probe radius . Ullmann , et al . 58 studied with QELSS the diﬀusion of 52 , 322 , and 655 nm radius polystyrene spheres in so - lutions of bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) in 0 . 15M NaCl , pH 7 . 0 . They compared D p with η as determined us - ing capillary viscometers , as seen in Figure 35 .

The Stokes - Einstein relation failed , D p η of the 322 and 655 nm spheres increasing with increasing c . D p of the 52 nm spheres showed re - entrant behav - ior , D p at ﬁrst increasing above its value in pure solvent and then returning to the values expected from η . At very small c , D p of the 52 nm spheres showed a local minimum . Dilution experiments showed that the mini - mum arose from aggregation of partially - protein - coated spheres due to the BSA in solution . When spheres were diluted from concentrated protein solution to more di - lute protein solution , D p of the 52 nm spheres returned linearly to its zero - c value , with no sign of aggregation 0 . 1 1 10 100 1000 c ( g / L ) 10 - 3 10 - 2 10 - 1 D p ( 10 - 7 c m 2 / s ) c 0 . 1 1 10 100 c ( g / L ) 10 - 3 10 - 2 10 - 1 D p ( 10 - 7 c m 2 / s ) d eﬀects . Wattenbarger , et al . 61 used FRAP to examine the dif - fusion of bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) through solu - tions of a 160 base - pair DNA at DNA concentrations 2 - 63 g / L and NaCl concentrations 0 . 01 and 0 . 1M . DNA molecules had lengths ca . 56 nm , identiﬁed as being ap - proximately 1 persistence length . As seen in Figure 36 , D p was approximately exponential in c . Increasing the solution ionic strength increases D p / D po , especially at larger DNA concentrations . Won , et al . 62 report on the diﬀusion of 200 nm radius PSL spheres in solutions of 1 . 3 MDa poly ( vinylmethylether ) : toluene using QELSS , as shown in Figure 37 . Additional measurements of D p made with forced Rayleigh scattering were in very good agreement with the QELSS data .

QELSS spectra were generally unimodal ; a small amplitude slow mode was sometimes seen . The decline in D p with increasing c was followed over more than four orders of magnitude . The product D p η / D po η o shows re - entrant behavior , ﬁrst climbing to nearly 3 . 5 , and then falling back to 1 . 0 by 10 g / L PVME . A comparison of PSL spheres in this system with spheres in polystyrene : dimethylformamide found that D / D o is to ﬁrst approximation a universal function of c [ η ] , except for the concentrations at which re - entrant departure from Stokes - Einstein behavior is found . Tracer diﬀusion of linear and star polystyrene molecules through PVME solutions has also been stud - ied extensively 63 , 64 , 65 , 66 , 67 , 68 . Zhou and Brown 69 measured D p of stearic - acid - coated silica spheres in polyisobutylene ( PIB ) : chloroform using QELSS , as seen in Figure 38 . Comparison was made with PFGNMR determinations of polymer self - diﬀusion and QELSS measurements of polymer mutual diﬀusion . Polymer molecular weights ranged from 57 kDa to 4 . 9 MDa . Sphere motion was diﬀusive , with a q 2 - dependent linewidth , leading to diﬀusion coeﬃcients seen in Figure 38 . Inverse Laplace transform of the spectra clearly re - solved a weak peak due to polymer mutual diﬀusion from an intense peak taken to reﬂect probe motion . Probe diﬀusion coeﬃcients very nearly tracked the solution vis - cosity , D p η increasing very slightly over the range of con - centrations studied . Many of the above studies compare D p with the macro - scopically measured viscosity η .

Phillies found probe diﬀusion in these mixtures followed accurately the Stokes - Einstein equation , even with η as large as 1000 cP . Wiltzius and van Saarloos 72 , using 19 , 45 . 5 , and 107 . 5 nm polystyrene spheres in 99 . 5 % glycerol for 280 ≤ T ≤ 320 K , found to high precision that the temperature dependence of D p was independent of probe size , contrary to an ear - lier literature report 73 . Phillies and Clomenil 74 exam - ined the possibility that this disagreement in the liter - ature was related to temperature - dependent changes in the shape of the spectrum S ( q , t ) . They made high pre - cision measurements of the spectral ﬁrst and second cu - mulants K 1 and K 2 of optical probes in water : erythritol , water : glycerol , and neat glycerol , their new result be - ing that K 2 in these systems was independent from T . Their measurements serve to reject any hypothe - sis that the earlier literature disagreement arose because diﬀerent spectral ﬁtting processes accommodated diﬀer - ently to temperature - dependent variations in a not - quite - exponential line shape of S ( q , t ) . From these simple - liquid studies , failures of the Stokes - Einstein equation in viscoelastic polymer solutions cannot to be ascribed sim - ply to the large zero - shear viscosity of those solutions . 1 . Hydroxypropylcellulose The translational diﬀusion of probes in hydroxypropy - lcellulose has been studied extremely extensively . Earlier work was assisted by the practical matters that HPC samples are available with a wide range of molecular weights , dissolve well in water , and have interesting ther - modynamic properties , including a transition from good to theta solvent behavior with increasing temperature as well as a liquid - to - liquid - crystal transition at extremely high polymer concentration . Much of the later work was motivated by the viscosity measurements of Phillies and Quinlan 75 , who observed η ( c ) for solutions of 300 kDa , 1 MDa , and 1 . 3 MDa HPC over wide concentration ranges . Phillies and Quinlan 75 found an unusual visco - metric transition not observed in most polymers studied with optical probe diﬀusion . At ﬁrst , work focused on ﬁnding evidence corroborating the reality of the transi - tion . Later work focused on the search for a physical interpretation of this transition . Phillies and Quinlan 75 established that up to a tran - sition concentration c + the concentration dependence of η of HPC solutions follows accurately a stretched expo - nential η = η o exp ( − αc ν ) . ( 14 ) At concentrations c > c + , the concentration dependence of η follows equally accurately a power law η = ¯ ηc x . ( 15 ) Here α is a scaling prefactor , ν and x are scaling ex - ponents , and η o and ¯ η are dimensional prefactors . To avoid model - dependent phrasings , Phillies and Quinlan termed the c < c + and c > c + domains the ’solution - like’ and ’meltlike’ regimes . At the transition , η is con - tinuous . Furthermore , the transition is analytic : Both the functions and their ﬁrst derivatives are continuous . There is no crossover regime : one form or the other de - scribes η ( c ) at every concentration . Systematic reviews of the literature 76 , 77 showed that such transitions hap - pen in some but not all polymer solutions . In natural units the transition concentration c + [ η ] for diﬀerent sys - tems has a wide range of diﬀerent values . HPC : water is distinguished by the very low polymer concentration at which the transition occurs , namely c + [ η ] ≈ 4 rather than the more typical c + [ η ] ≈ 35 or larger . The nonuni - versality of the transition concentration , the lack of a matching transition in D s ( c ) , indeed , the complete lack of a transition in many polymer systems , all show that the viscosity transition here should not be confused with a hypothesized transition to reptation dynamics . For clarity , the remaining literature in this Section is discussed in chronological order . Work by Phillies and Quinlan had been preceded by extensive optical probe diﬀusion studies of HPC : water solutions : Brown and Rymden 78 used QELSS to examine 72 nm radius PSL spheres diﬀusing in solutions of hydroxyethylcellulose ( HEC ) , hydroxypropylcellulose ( HPC ) , carboxymethyl - cellulose ( CMC ) , and poly ( acrylic acid ) ( PAA ) . The focus was polymer - induced cluster formation , evidenced by the form of substantial decreases in D p and increases in the 24 second spectral cumulant as seen at very low ( 0 . 001 g / g ) concentrations of HEC and HPC . These changes were substantially reversed by the addition of 0 . 15 % Triton X - 100 . D p of spheres was reduced by the addition of small amounts of fully - charged pH 9 CMC , but addition of TX - 100 had no eﬀect in CMC solutions . Brown and Rymden also examined sphere diﬀusion in nondilute polymer so - lutions . Relatively complex dependences of D p on con - centration were suppressed by the addition of TX - 100 . In the presence of TX - 100 , simple stretched - exponential concentration dependences were observed , but the second spectral cumulant still increased with increasing polymer concentration . 0 10 20 30 40 c ( g / L ) 10 0 10 1 10 2 h / h 0 FIG . 39 : Viscosity 79 of M w 110 ( (cid:13) ) , 140 ( (cid:3) ) , 450 ( △ ) , and 850 ( • ) kDa HPC , and ﬁts of η ( c ) to exponential concentration dependences . Yang and Jamieson 79 examined the diﬀusion of polystyrene spheres in HPC , measuring the shear vis - cosity η ( Figure 39 ) , and using QELSS to obtain D p ( Figure 40 ) . Polymer molecular weights based on static light scattering measurements were 110 , 140 , 450 , and 850 kDa ; sphere diameters were 120 , 210 , and 350 nm . Polymer concentrations extended up to 40 g / l . Yang and Jamieson found D p to be independent of polymer con - centration over a range of not - quite - zero concentrations . At larger concentrations , D p fell as a stretched exponen - tial in c . With Triton X - 100 added to suppress polymer binding , D p ( c ) was larger than expected from η . The ratio of the macroscopic and microscopic viscosities η / η µ increases with increasing c and M . A modest depen - dence of η / η µ on probe R is seen , small probes having the smaller η µ .

Addition of Triton X - 100 dramatically markedly reduced the hydrodynamic radii determined using QELSS . D p of nonaggregated spheres very nearly tracks η − 1 , with a modest 12 % deviation for the larger spheres ; however , only two measurements with η / η 0 > 10 were reported . Mustafa and Russo 81 applied QELSS to measure the diﬀusion of 90 . 7 nm radius polystyrene latex through so - lutions of high - molecular - weight ( 1 MDa ) hydroxypropy - lcellulose at concentrations up to 1 . 5 g / L . Comparison was made between solutions to which Triton X - 100 had been added in order to eliminate polymer binding to the probes , and solutions to which Triton X - 100 had not been added .

Phillies and Clomenil 82 made a detailed study of the diﬀusion of 67 nm PSL spheres in 139 kDa HPC at 10 o C ( good - solvent conditions ) and 41 o C ( near - theta - solvent conditions ) , as seen in Figure 41 . At each temperature , D p depended on polymer concentration via a stretched exponential exp ( − αc ν ) . The exponent ν was 1 under theta conditions but 0 . 74 under good - solvent conditions , showing probe diﬀusion can be sensitive to solvent qual - ity . The dependence of ν on solvent quality is not en - tirely useful as a test of models for polymer dynamics : The observed dependence is equally predicted by the Langevin - Rondelez 21 , Altenberger 83 , and hydrodynamic scaling 84 , 85 treatments . 0 . 01 0 . 1 1 10 100 c ( g / L ) 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 10 6 h ( c P ) FIG . 42 : η of 139 ( ◦ ) and 1280 kDa ( (cid:3) , displaced two - fold ver - tically for clarity ) hydroxypropylcellulose at temperatures 10 C ( ﬁlled points ) and 39 C ( open points ) and ﬁts to stretched exponentials ( smooth curves ) and power laws ( straight lines ) , after Phillies , et al . 86 . Phillies , et al . 86 measure diﬀusion of 67 nm PSL spheres via QELSS in 139 , 146 , 415 , and 1280 kDa hy - droxypropylcellulose ( HPC ) at temperatures 10 , 25 , and 39 o C , for polymer concentrations up to 100 g / l . Shear viscosities were measured for the same solutions . Aque - ous HPC is a good - solvent system at 10C and approaches a pseudotheta transition at 41 C , so varying the temper - ature allows a variation in solvent quality . η ( Figure 42 ) was found to have a stretched - exponential concentration dependence up to an apparent transition concentration c + , and an apparent power - law concentration dependence at higher concentrations . These observations led to the much more systematic study of Phillies and Quinlan 75 . Spectra were analysed with Koppel’s method of cumu - lants . Individual spectra also ﬁt well to stretched expo - nentials in time .

S ( q , t ) was obtained with an experimental S / N of 300 - 1000 . A careful search was made for a very fast spectral mode that might have perturbed cumulant ﬁts ; none was found . Later work from the same group found that S ( q , t ) for probes in HPC : water is generally bimodal . Ref . 86 was found to have examined the more prominent shorter - lived relaxational mode . Mustafa , et al . 87 used ﬂuorescence recovery after photobleaching to examine diﬀusion of ﬂuorescein dye through 130 , 292 , and 855 kDa HPC solutions . D p was measured at various grating spacings and temperatures at HPC concentrations from dilute solution up through the HPC liquid : liquid crystal phase transition . As seen in Figure 45 , D p decreases approximately exponentially in polymer concentration but is independent of polymer molecular weight . There is no discontinuity in D p ( c ) on crossing the HPC liquid : liquid crystal phase transition . Ngai and Phillies 88 extend the Ngai - Rendell coupling model 89 to treat probe diﬀusion and polymer dynamics in polymer solutions . This is not an experimental paper ; it forces extant experimental data to confront a particu - lar theoretical model , which in the paper was extensively reconstructed to treat the particular experimental meth - ods under consideration . Ngai and Phillies consider zero - shear viscosities and optical probe diﬀusion spectra for HPC solutions , extracting from them the Ngai - Rendell model relaxation time τ o and coupling exponent n . Opti - cal probe spectra can be used to obtain n in four indepen - dent ways , namely from η ( c ) and from the concentration , time , and wave - vector dependences of g ( 1 ) ( q , t ) . The four paths from η and g ( 1 ) ( q , t ) lead to consistent values for n , especially for larger probes and higher polymer concen - 27 trations at which the scaling - coupling arguments invoked in the paper are most likely to be valid . Phillies and LaCroix 90 used QELSS to study diﬀusion of four PSL sphere species in aqueous 300 kDa HPC at concentrations up to 15 g / L . Spheres had diameters 21 , 102 , 189 , and 760 nm . Field correlation functions were ﬁt to the sum of a weak , fast initial exponential and a stretched exponential exp ( − θt β ) . The fast initial expo - nential was never more than 2 . 5 % of g ( 1 ) ( q , t ) . β and the relaxation pseudorate θ both had stretched - exponential concentration dependences , the dependences being the stronger for the larger probes . For the 21 nm spheres , θη increased with increasing c ; for the large spheres , θη was very nearly independent from c . The relaxation time τ = θ − 1 / β depends on c less strongly than η does , so that for smaller spheres τ / η falls with increasing c . For larger spheres , τ / η is approximately independent of c . However , because these spectra follow exp ( − ( t / τ ) β ) with β 6 = 1 , it would be erroneous to write τ = Dq 2 for some D . In consequence , the constancy of τ / η represents pseudo - Stokes - Einsteinian behavior , not Stokes - Einsteinian be - havior , for τ . These results are subsumed in the later studies of Streletzky and collaborators , discussed below . 100 20 50 200 500 2R ( nm ) 10 - 6 10 - 5 10 - 4 10 - 3 10 - 2 Q s FIG . 46 : Sharp mode pseudorate constant versus probe size at HPC concentrations 0 ( (cid:13) ) , 0 . 5 ( (cid:3) ) , 1 ( ♦ ) , 2 ( △ ) , 3 ( ▽ ) , 3 . 75 ( ⋆ ) , 4 ( • ) , 5 ( (cid:7) ) , 6 ( (cid:4) ) , and 7 ( N ) g / L , showing a demarkation between small and large probe behavior for R between 20 and 30 nm , after Streletzky and Phillies 91 . Streletzky and Phillies 91 use QELSS to study the dif - fusion of 14 - 455 nm diameter PSL spheres in 1MDa hydroxypropylcellulose - water for concentrations 1 ≤ c ≤ 7 g / L . Probe spectra ﬁt well to a sum of two stretched ex - ponential modes exp ( − θt β ) , characterized in this paper as ’slow’ and ’fast’ . The dependences of spectral ﬁtting parameters on probe radius , polymer concentration , wave vector , and solution viscosity were examined . Probe be - haviors fell into two classes , distinguished by probe size . Figure 46 shows sample results , namely θ s against probe radius R at diﬀerent concentrations : for small probes , θ s is very nearly independent of c , while for large probes θ s decreases sharply with increasing c . The characteris - tic length separating large and small probes , which ap - pears to be the same at all polymer concentrations , is ap - proximately the size of a complete polymer chain , probes having a diameter less than the polymer hydrodynamic radius being ’small’ and probes having a diameter larger than the polymer radius of gyration being ’large’ . A simi - lar distinction between small and large probes is seen for β of the slow mode , with β ≈ 1 for large probes and β decreasing with increasing c for small ( R ≤ 35 nm ) probes . On the other hand , θ of the fast mode is nearly independent of concentration regardless of probe size . Streletzky and Phillies 92 present an approach to in - terpreting the QELSS spectral mode structure for opti - cal probes diﬀusing in HPC : water , based on their prior work . They consider only probes in the HPC solutionlike regime , whose phenomenology is sharply divided between ’small’ and ’large’ probes , small and large being deﬁned relative to the size of the polymer chains . The crossover from small - to large - probe behavior is found at the same probe radius at all polymer concentrations . They inter - pret three time - scale - separated modes to be : ( i ) a large - probe ’slow’ mode that appears to reveal particle motion in a viscous medium , ( ii ) large - probe ’fast’ and small - probe ’slow’ modes that occur on the same time scale , and appear to be related to chain internal dynamics , and ( iii ) a small - probe ’fast’ mode . The large - probe ’slow’ mode is approximately governed by the solution viscos - ity , and goes linearly to zero as q 2 → 0 . Later work by these authors established that the ’fast’ and ’slow’ modes were better described as ’sharp’ and ’broad’ , depending on their time stretching exponent β , because ’fast’ and ’slow’ do not consistently describe the mode lifetimes . The Ngai scaling - coupling model only works for modes in category ( ii ) , which for both small and large probes is the shorter - lived of the two modes . Streletzky and Phillies 93 compare optical probe diﬀu - sion and viscosity measurements on HPC : water . The im - mediate question treated by Streletzky and Phillies 93 was whether the transition is real , whether the apparent tran - sition at c + is simply an artifact of ref . 75’s numerical ﬁtting procedures , or as a third alternative whether the stretched exponential behavior is merely a numerical ap - proximant lacking deep physical meaning . Streletzky and Phillies 93 proceeded by using QELSS to measure the dif - fusion of large ( 50 , 87 , and 189 nm diameter ) PSL probes in aqueous 1MDa HPC , including concentrations above and below c + . After testing alternatives , spectra were ﬁt to the sum of a fast stretched exponential and a slow pure exponential g ( 1 ) ( q , τ ) = A o ( A f exp ( − θ f c β f ) + ( 1 − A f ) exp ( − θc ) . ( 16 ) At c + , every single spectral parameter changes its con - centration dependence . As seen in Figure 47 , below c + , 28 0 5 10 15 c ( g / L ) 10 - 5 10 - 4 10 - 3 10 - 2 10 - 1 Q b FIG . 47 : Broad mode pseudorate constant θ f against polymer concentration for 50 ( • ) , 87 ( ♦ ) , and 189 ( + ) nm probes , showing the change in concentration dependence near c + ≈ 6 g / L , after Streletzky and Phillies 93 . θ f is independent of c ; at larger c , θ f decreases as a stretched exponential in c . As seen in Figure 48 , β f de - clines with increasing c until c + is reached ; at higher con - centrations β f is nearly independent of c . The fast - mode fractional amplitude A f is nearly zero at c = 0 ; it climbs with increasing c until it reaches A f ≈ 0 . 4 − 0 . 6 , which it does at a concentration near c + . θ follows stretched exponentials in c ; near c + , for the 87 and 189 nm probes there is a sudden change in the slopes of the θ ( c ) curves . At c + , the correlations of θ and θ f with η both change . θ f η climbs near - exponentially with increasing c until c + is reached ; at larger c , θ f η increases weakly with increas - ing c . The slope dθη / dc also changes near c + , though less markedly than the slope of θη changes . θ and θ f are both linear in q 2 . Streletzky and Phillies conclude that the marked changes in the concentration dependences of the optical probe diﬀusion parameters near c + prove the physical reality of the solutionlike - meltlike transition . Streletzky and Phillies 94 attempt to apply the Ngai - Phillies 88 coupling / scaling model for probe diﬀusion to their QELSS spectra 91 of mesoscopic probes diﬀusing in 1MDa HPC . The model consistently works for one of the two spectral modes but not the other . For large probes ( probe R > R g of the polymer ) , the model works for the shorter - lived stretched - exponential mode , but not for the longer - lived pure exponential mode . For small spheres , both modes relax as stretched exponentials ; the coupling - scaling description works for the shorter - lived mode but not for the longer - lived mode . In the original paper , modes are called ’fast’ or ’slow’ , not longer - or shorter - lived . Because ’fast’ or ’slow’ were identiﬁed based on 0 4 8 12 16 c ( g / L ) 0 . 0 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 . 0 b b FIG . 48 : Broad mode stretching exponent β f against polymer concentration for 50 ( • ) , 87 ( ♦ ) , and 189 ( + ) nm probes , showing the change in concentration dependence near c + ≈ 6 g / L , after Streletzky and Phillies 93 . early parts of the slope of g ( 1 ) ( q , t ) rather than the inte - grated lifetime , and ’fast’ and ’slow’ do not map one - to - one to short - and long - lived , the original paper identiﬁed the modes for which coupling - scaling works as the ’fast’ mode of small probes and the ’slow’ mode of large par - ticles , leaving it less clear which physics was applicable when . Streletzky and Phillies eventually demonstrated that these results are consistent with the earlier papers of Phillies and Lacroix 90 and Ngai and Phillies 88 . The demonstration consists of showing that Phillies and Lacroix had only been able to study the shorter - lived mode of probes in 300 kDa HPC , for which the Ngai - Phillies model 88 is correct ; in both systems , it is the shorter - lived mode that follows coupling - scaling . Streletzky and Phillies 95 make a systematic presenta - tion of their ﬁndings on probe diﬀusion in aqueous HPC . Spectra were found to be sums of two stretched exponen - tials . Their principle results are : ( i ) probes in the solu - tionlike c < c + regime , in their scattering behavior , fall into two classes , small and large . The classes are sepa - rated by a well - deﬁned concentration - independent bound - ary . The length scale separating the probe classes is ap - proximately the hydrodynamic radius of a polymer chain , not a hypothesized mesh size ξ . ( ii ) There are two dis - tinct concentration regimes , solutionlike and meltlike , in the sense of Phillies and Quinlan 75 . At the solutionlike - meltlike concentration boundary , parameters describing the spectra of large probes show dramatic changes in their concentration dependences . ( iii ) In the solution - like regime , for large probes θη depends relatively weakly 29 on polymer concentration . In the same regime , θη of small probes and θ f η of all probes increases greatly ( typ - ically more than 100 - fold over the observed concentration range ) with increasing c . Streletzky and Phillies oﬀer an extensive series of physical interpretations that rational - ize the summarized data . Phillies , et al . 96 extend prior work on HPC : water with a QELSS study of the diﬀusion of small 35 nm probes in nondilute 1MDa HPC . They introduce a novel alter - native process for characterizing light scattering spectra . Mindful of the exponential integral Z ∞ 0 dt exp ( − Γ t ) = Γ − 1 , ( 17 ) they took spectra that could be accurately represented as a sum of exponentials or stretched exponentials , and characterized a spectrum g ( 1 ) ( t ) = Z ∞ 0 d Γ A ( Γ ) exp ( − Γ t ) ( 18 ) via its time moments M n ≡ Z ∞ 0 dt t n g ( 1 ) ( t ) = γ ( 1 + n ) h Γ 1 + n i . ( 19 ) Here γ ( 1 + n ) = n ! is the conventional Gamma function , the M n being the time moments . In general , M n / n ! = h Γ − 1 − n i . If A ( Γ ) is normalized , M 0 = h Γ − 1 i is the mean relaxation time . For a stretched - exponential mode , the mean relaxation time is M 0 ≡ Z ∞ 0 dt exp ( − θt β ) = γ ( 1 + 1 / β ) / θ 1 / β . ( 20 ) A direct computation of the time moments is sensitive to noise at large t . Phillies , et al . instead obtained ana - lytic forms that accurately ﬁt their spectra , and obtained the moments as integrals of the analytic forms . Phillies , et al . conclude that time moments provide a substantially less complex characterization of relaxational modes than do alternative parameterizations of the same modes of the same system . O’Connell , et al . 97 report using QELSS to examine the mode structure of probe - free aqueous 1 MDa HPC solutions . Below approximately 6 g / L HPC , QELSS spectra of HPC : water are well characterized as a sum of two stretched - exponential spectral modes having ap - proximately equal amplitudes . At 6 g / l , which is the crossover concentration for the viscometric solutionlike - meltlike transition , an emergent slow mode takes up half the total scattering intensity ( Figure 49 ) . The slow mode does not arise from aggregates : With increasing c , I / c shows ( Figure 50 ) a slow decrease continuous through the transition . This study demonstrates both the utility of measuring simultaneously optical probe spectra and matching spectra of probe - free systems , and of measur - ing absolute scattering intensities . Phillies , et al . 96 found that small probe spectra shift at c + from a bimodal to a trimodal form .

The intermediate - mode amplitude has very nearly the same concentration dependence as the fast - mode amplitude , after O’Connell , et al . 97 . slow mode , which appears at the viscometric transition concentration c + , has relaxation times of several seconds . The two modes found below c + , described by the authors as the sharp and broad modes , partially merge at c + . Above c + , the original sharp and broad modes have very nearly the same mean relaxation times , but very diﬀerent widths β . Phillies , et al . emphasize that their data show that while some probe and polymer relaxations happen on similar time scales , they are not the same : the probe and polymer modes have concentration dependences of opposite sign , so the probe and polymer modes on the same time scale do not simply reﬂect probes and poly - mers moving in unison . Ref . 96 presents results conﬁrming Streletzky and Phillies’s 91 prior interpretation that HPC solutions have a dominant , concentration - independent characteristic dynamic length scale , namely the radius of a polymer chain , which for this species is R ∼ 50 nm . In particular : ( i ) There are distinct small - probe and large probe phe - nomenologies , with the division between small and large probes being about 50 nm , the same at all polymer con - centrations . ( ii ) For small probes , the relative amplitude of the sharp and broad modes depends markedly on scat - tering vector q with a crossover near q − 1 ≈ 70 nm . ( iii ) The mean relaxation rate of the small - probe broad mode increases markedly near q − 1 ≈ 50 nm . ( iv ) The probe intermediate mode becomes much more strongly concen - tration dependent when it becomes longer - lived than the polymer intermediate mode , which occurs at the rheo - 30 0 4 8 12 16 c ( g / L ) 0 10 20 30 40 I / c FIG . 50 : Normalized intensity I / c of aqueous HPC solutions , after O’Connell , et al . 97 . 0 5 10 15 c ( g / L ) 10 - 1 10 0 10 1 10 2 10 3 10 4 10 5 < G > ( s - 1 ) FIG . 51 : Mean lifetimes of the fast ( circles ) , intermediate ( triangles ) , and slow ( diamonds ) modes of HPC in water , from two - stretched - exponential ﬁts ( ﬁlled points ) , and three - stretched - exponential ﬁts ( open points ) , after O’Connell , et al . 97 . logical transition concentration only if the probe is the correct size , namely 50 nm . Phillies , et al . 96 propose that the dynamic changes at c + reﬂect the formation of a Kivelson glass 98 in these systems . In a Kivelson glass , one encounters long - lived equilibrium structures with frustrated growth that pre - vents them from growing into a crystalline solid . The concentration of these structures increases at low tem - perature , leading to glass formation . In polymer solu - tions studied by Phillies , et al . , solution properties are very nearly athermal at accessible temperatures . Increas - ing concentration replaces decreasing temperature as the factor driving structure formation . B . Probe Rotational Diﬀusion By examining the polarized and depolarized light scat - tering spectra at a series of scattering angles , or by mea - suring the depolarized spectrum at zero scattering angle , it is possible to infer the rotational diﬀusion coeﬃcient D r of probe particles that depolarize scattered light . Camins and Russo 99 used zero - angle depolarized light scattering to study the rotational diﬀusion of poly ( tetraﬂuoroethylene ) colloidal probes in gelling poly - acrylamide . The probes were optically - anisotropic pro - late ellipsoids of modest ( 3 : 1 ) axial ratio , the eﬀective hydrodynamic radii being 140 ± 40 nm , dispersed in polyacrylamide systems undergoing gelation . During gelation , the depolarized relaxation slows and broadens markedly , changing from a near - exponential relaxation to a stretched exponential with exponent β ≈ 0 . 5 . In - terpretation of spectra in terms of mobile and immobile probe fractions suggests that most probes become immo - bile during the gelation process , but at least some are at least somewhat free to move . Cheng and Mason 100 discuss the extension of optical probe diﬀusion methods to study rotational diﬀusion in 900 kDa poly ( ethylene oxide ) . The optical probe was a micron - size α - eicosane microdisk whose angular ori - entation could be tracked with time resolution of 0 . 3 µ s using microscopy . Because the time - dependent orienta - tion and angular displacement θ ( t ) of the disk polar axis were tracked directly , Cheng and Mason were able to determine h ( θ ( t ) ) 2 i and estimate | G ∗ ( ω ) | for a single polyethyleneoxide solution . Cush , et al . 101 used depolarized light scattering to study the rotational diﬀusion of tobacco mosaic virus ( TMV ) in dextran and ﬁcoll solutions . TMV is a rod of length L ≈ 300 nm and diameter d ≈ 18 nm 101 . This study replaces the prior results from the same research group 102 using essentially the same method , on precisely the same system , by applying corrections due to the opti - cal activity of dextran and ﬁcoll and more subtle instru - mental issues . The concentration dependences of D r and D p of TMV in 670 kDa dextran and 428 kDa ﬁcoll were examined for concentrations up to 15 or 34 wt % , respec - tively , as seen in Figures 52 and 53 . Polydispersities of the dextran and ﬁcoll were 1 . 94 and 4 . 3 , with R g mea - sured from light scattering of 22 and 20 nm , respectively . Over this concentration range , η increases by nearly 100 - fold , while D r and D p fall by nearly the same factor . Within experimental scatter , the concentration depen - dences of D p , D r , and η − 1 in ﬁcoll solutions were very nearly the same . D p η and D r η increased perhaps 50 % in 31 0 4 8 12 16 20 c ( wt % ) 0 . 01 0 . 1 1 10 D p , D r , h - 1 FIG . 52 : D p ( (cid:13) ) and D r ( (cid:3) ) of tobacco mosaic virus in 647 kDa dextran solutions , and η − 1 ( (cid:7) ) of those solutions , after Cush , et al . 101 , and ( lines ) ﬁts to stretched exponentials in c . 0 10 20 30 40 c ( wt % ) 0 . 01 0 . 1 1 10 D p , D r , h - 1 FIG . 53 : D p ( (cid:13) ) and D r ( (cid:3) ) of tobacco mosaic virus in 428 kDa ﬁcoll solutions , and η − 1 ( (cid:7) ) of those solutions , after Cush , et al . 101 , and ( lines ) ﬁts to stretched exponentials in c . dextran solutions . The authors also studied the molecu - lar weight dependence of D r and D p at ﬁxed 14 . 6 wt % dextran concentration , ﬁnding D r and D p have power - law dependences on polymer M w for 40 ≤ M w ≤ 2750 kDa . Cush , et al . reason from the minimal issues with Stokes - Einsteinian behavior for D r and D p that their data support a continuum picture of polymer dynam - ics in which ’hydrodynamic eﬀects surpass any due to topological constraints’ , even in solutions having nearly a hundred times the viscosity of water . Hill and Soane 103 examine the rotational diﬀusion of collagen molecules in aqueous 4 Mda polyethyleneoxide using the electrooptic Kerr eﬀect . Collagen is a rigid rod , with diameter and length of ca . 1 . 5 and 170 nm , respec - tively . In a Kerr eﬀect experiment , a linearly polarized laser beam is passed through a sample on which an elec - tric ﬁeld has brieﬂy been imposed . Hill and Soane cite 24 kV / cm as their largest attainable electric ﬁeld . Partial induced alignment of the molecules in the cell leads to an induced birefringence and thence to a change in the transmission of the polarized light , through a quarter - wave plate and second optical polarizer , into the detector . The relaxation time for the Kerr eﬀect is determined by rotational diﬀusion of the weakly aligned objects in the Kerr cell . The collagen preparations had a bimodal mass distribution , so two relaxation times were observed , both strongly concentration dependent . Jamil and Russo 104 studied translational and rota - tional diﬀusion of poly ( tetraﬂuoroethylene ) latex in aque - ous sodium polystyrenesulfonate ( NaPSS ) . Spectra were single exponentials . D p and D r were extracted from the q 2 dependence of the spectral linewidths . Addition of NaCl causes the probes to aggregate ; further addition of NaPSS reverses the salt - induced probe aggregation , even though it appears that NaPSS does not bind to the latex particles . D r tracks the changes in viscosity of the solu - tion attendant to addition of polymer , in the sense that ηD r is independent of polymer concentration . However , at ﬁxed c , ηD r does decrease as the salt concentration is increased . Koenderink , et al . 105 examine the motion of perﬂuo - rinated hydrocarbon spheres through xanthan solutions . Depolarized QELSS spectra were measured at a series of angles and ﬁt to second - order cumulant expansions . The spheres had radii 93 nm ; xanthan molecular weight was 4 MDa . Koenderink , et al . , measured solution vis - cosity , shear thinning , storage and loss moduli , transla - tional and rotational diﬀusion coeﬃcients D p and D r of the probes , and probe sedimentation coeﬃcient s , and made an extensive and systematic comparison with the available theoretical background . As seen in Figure 54 , xanthan is far more eﬀective at increasing the solution viscosity than at hindering translational or rotational dif - fusion of the probes , and is more eﬀective at hindering sedimentation than at hindering diﬀusion . The observed variation of D p η and D r η with c in xanthan solutions is much larger than the variation observed for probes in many other systems . Le Goﬀ , et al . 106 polymerized actin fragments with var - ious degrees of labelling , using a protocol which led to ends made of heavily - labelled actin and an extremely long center segment that was sparsely labelled or unlabelled . Fluorescence microscopy was used to track the motion of the labelled ends , determining thereby the distribu - tion and time dependence of the ﬂuctuating end - to - end 32 0 . 01 0 . 1 c ( wt % ) 0 . 001 0 . 01 0 . 1 1 f 0 / f 1000 100 10 1 h / h 0 FIG . 54 : D p ( (cid:3) ) , D r ( (cid:13) ) , and s ( ♦ ) of 92 . 5 nm radius spheres in 4 MDa xanthan , all reported [ left axis ] as nominal normal - ized drag coeﬃcients f 0 / f , and shear viscosity η / η 0 ( • ) [ right axis ] , after data of Koenderink , et al . 105 , and ﬁts to stretched exponentials in c . distance and the angular reorientation of the end - to - end vector . Proof - of - principle data was obtained . Repeat of these experiments in solutions at a series of concen - trations should provide extremely valuable information about translation , rotation , and internal motion of some - what rigid polymer chains . Phalakornkul , et al . 107 used transient electric birefrin - gence to examine rotational relaxation of poly - ( γ - benzyl - α - L - glutamate ) ( PBLG ) in solutions of silica spheres . PBLG preparations had lengths 68 , 128 , or 170 nm . Spheres had radius 31 nm . Birefringence spectra were analyzed with the Laplace inversion program CONTIN , which found consistent fast and slow modes and an oc - casional very weak , very fast relaxation . At very low sphere concentration , the slow mode reduces to rod ro - tation . The fast mode appears to correspond to the ﬁrst bending mode of the PBLG . The slow mode of the short rods had a concentration - independent relaxation time τ s . Increasing the rod length greatly increases the concentra - tion dependence of τ s . For the longest rods , τ s increases three - fold as sphere volume fraction is increased from 0 . 0 to 0 . 08 , while the relaxation time of the ﬁrst internal mode increases less strongly with increasing c . η and all rod relaxation times had simple exponential concentra - tion dependences ( Figure 55 ) . The concentration depen - dence of η is stronger than the concentration dependence of τ s of the short rods , but weaker than the concentration dependence of τ s of the long rods . Sohn , et al . 108 used polarized and depolarized light scattering spectroscopy to examine the diﬀusion of 0 0 . 02 0 . 04 0 . 06 0 . 08 0 . 1 f 10 1 10 2 10 3 t ( m S ) FIG . 55 : Rotational relaxation times of 68 ( (cid:13) ) , 128 ( ♦ ) , and 170 ( (cid:3) ) nm PBLG rods in solutions of 62 nm silica spheres as a function of sphere concentration 107 , and simple - exponential ﬁts to τ r ( c ) . various latex particles containing magnetite inclusions through solutions of 70 kDa polystyrene sulfonate . Most work was done on 50 nm radius particles . Extensive pre - liminary work was needed to characterize the available latex - magnetite probes , which tend to be rather polydis - perse unless they are fractionated . Addition of the poly - mer reverses salt - induced aggregation of the probes . On increasing the polymer concentration the translational and rotational diﬀusion coeﬃcients D t and D r both fell . At ﬁxed polymer concentration , addition of NaCl did not have an obvious eﬀect on D t but tended to reduce D r . At ﬁxed salt or polymer concentration , the number of polymer or salt concentrations ( respectively ) that were examined was not large , so it is diﬃcult to make detailed inferences about the eﬀect of the solutes on probe diﬀu - sion . C . Particle Tracking Methods In an extremely important paper , Apgar and Tseng , et al . 109 measured the distribution of mean - square displace - ments for probes in a variety of solutions . They used ﬂuorescence microscopy to track ﬂuorescently labelled microspheres diﬀusing through actin solutions . Spheres with radii in the range 0 . 43 - 0 . 6 µ m were used . Tracking was used to determine the mean - square displacements as functions of time for a large number of probe particles , and to obtain statistics for mean - square deviations over each of several time intervals . In homogeneous water - glycerol solutions , the distribution of mean - square dis - 33 placements is Gaussian . In solutions of dilute actin , con - centrated F - actin , and F - actin / fascin , the distributions are very deﬁnitely not Gaussian . Correspondingly , anal - yses of measurements on particle motion in F - actin so - lutions , if based on an assumption of Gaussian particle displacements , have a doubtful starting point . Chen , et al . 110 used video microscopy to measure the motion of single particles and pairs of particles through a viscoelastic solvent , namely λ - DNA in water . Mea - surements were made of one - and two - particle diﬀusion for spheres with diameters 0 . 46 , 0 . 97 , and 2 . 0 µ m and in - terpreted using ’two - point microrheology’ 111 , which com - pares the diﬀusion coeﬃcient of a single particle with the relative diﬀusion of pairs of particles . Interpretation was made in terms of a model involving polymer depletion zones around each particle . Crocker , et al . 112 describe a novel physical technique in which video microscopy is used to capture the posi - tions of pairs of diﬀusing particles at an extended se - ries of times . Cross correlations in the particle displace - ments yield a range - dependent cross - diﬀusion coeﬃcient D ij ( r , t ) , where r the distance between particles i and j , and t is the elapsed time during which the displace - ment occurs . The Laplace transform of D ij is taken to be inversely proportional to a frequency - dependent vis - cosity ˜ G ( s ) / s . The method was applied to study 100 and 235 nm radius spheres in glycerol , guar gum , and F - actin solutions . In glycerol solutions , the single - particle and cross - diﬀusion coeﬃcients agree with each other . In viscoelastic guar solutions , there are factor - of - two dis - agreements in the storage and loss moduli inferred from the single - particle and cross - diﬀusion coeﬃcients and a generalized Stokes - Einstein equation ; G ′ and G ′′ from D ij ( r , t ) are much closer to macroscopic measurements . Crocker , et al . 112 conclude that their two - point pair diﬀu - sion method has ”underlying validity” , while ”single par - ticle microrheology provides qualitatively diﬀerent mod - uli and completely fails to detect the crossover [ of G ′ and G ′′ ] ” . Crocker , et al . ’s 112 implicit conclusion is that single - particle microrheology does not provide valid rhe - ological measurements . Dichtl and Sackmann 113 studied the diﬀusion of indi - vidual actin chains to which substantial numbers of 35 nm ﬂuorescent latex or 17 nm gold beads had been at - tached , employing a confocal laser scanning microscope to track bead motions with three - dimensional resolution . Bead positions ﬂuctuated ; bead motions could be decom - posed into components parallel and perpendicular to the visualizable polymer chain . Measurements were conﬁned to time intervals much shorter than the terminal relax - ation time of the solutions . Fluctuations perpendicular to the chain axis had a Gaussian distribution whose width varied from bead to bead by nearly an order of magni - tude . Fluctuations parallel to the tube axis had a non - Gaussian bimodal distribution . At short times , mean square displacements parallel and perpendicular to the local chain are nearly equal . At longer times , displace - ments parallel to the chain continue to increase , while displacements perpendicular to the local chain tend to cease to increase . However , the authors note that D parallel to the chains , as measured by them , implies a solvent viscosity an order of magnitude larger that the actual viscosity of water . That is , the apparent bead mobility along the chain axis is very diﬀerent from the expected bead mobility in pure solvent . Gardel , et al . 114 used video microscopy to track 230 , 320 , and 420 nm radius carboxylate - modiﬁed spheres dif - fusing in solutions of F - actin . Single - particle - motions and correlated - motion of pairs of particles were com - puted . F - actin solutions are considerably more eﬀec - tive at retarding the motion of large particles than at retarding the motions of small particles , especially at long times . Relative motions of particles were obtained for particles separated by as much as 100 µ m . Single - particle motions sometimes show longer - time plateaus . Correlated - pair displacements increase linearly in time with no plateau , but at the longest times studied the mean - square correlated pair motions are not yet larger than the observed plateaus . G ′′ ( ω ) from one - particle and two - particle measurements diﬀer by factors of three or more , the two - particle values being in relatively close agreement with macroscopic measurements of G ′′ ( ω ) made with a parallel - plate stress - controlled rheometer . Gittes , et al . 115 observed the overdamped thermal dis - placements of single 0 . 9 µ m silica spheres in F - actin and polyacrylamide gels . Microscopic observation was ap - plied to isolate single particles , whose motions were de - tected interferometrically . The power spectrum of the displacements h ( ∆ x ) 2 ω i was used to compute the shear modulus , which has both real and imaginary parts . Over a frequency range 0 . 1 ≤ ν ≤ 3 · 10 3 Hz , G ′ ( ω ) and G ′′ ( ω ) both showed power - law frequency dependences ∼ ω z with z ≈ 0 . 76 . Goodman , et al . 116 studied the motion of 1 µ m ﬂuorescent - labelled carboxylate - modiﬁed polystyrene la - tex spheres through solutions of circular - supercoiled and linearized ( single cut at controlled location ) DNAs , size 2 . 96 , 5 . 4 , and 10 . 3 kilobasepairs ( 1 . 8 - 6 MDa ; contour lengths 1 , 1 . 84 , 3 . 57 µ m ) , using particle tracking meth - ods . The linear and matching circular DNAs are unam - biguously identical in molecular weight . While issues of chain conﬁguration can arise in studies of synthetic cir - cular polymers , the circular DNAs here are unambigu - ously not knotted or topologically crosslinked . The spa - tial resolution on particle resolution was 5 nm . Video monitoring was limited to a 30 Hz time resolution . From particle - tracking , time - dependent mean - square displace - ments were determined as functions of DNA molecular weight , concentration and circularization . Solution mi - croviscosities η were inferred from the particle motions via a generalized Stokes - Einstein equation . At these rela - tively long times and small viscosities ( η < 20 cP ) , mean - square displacements after convective corrections were in most solutions nearly linear in time . In some linear DNA solutions , the mean - square displacement was not simply diﬀusive . In these cases , h ∆ x 2 i was replaced with a nom - 34 0 0 . 4 0 . 8 1 . 2 1 . 6 2 c ( g / L ) 0 8 16 24 h m ( c P ) FIG . 56 : η µ from mean - square displacement of 500 nm radius PSL through circular DNAs ( (cid:13) , (cid:3) , ♦ ) ( masses 2 . 96 , 5 . 40 , and 10 . 31 kilobasepairs , respectively ) and their single - cut linear derivatives ( • , + , (cid:7) ) , after Goodman , et al . 116 . inal creep microcompliance that is linearly proportional ( Γ ( t ) ∼ h ∆ x 2 ( t ) i ) to the time - dependent mean - square displacement . Goodman , et al . 116 report evidence that particle mi - crotracking can also provide evidence about solution mi - croviscoelasticity that is more detailed than that pro - vided by macroscopic measurements , for example , details of spatial variations in microviscoelastic parameters that could be ascribed to solution microheterogeneity . The microviscosities for the linear DNAs were as much as several times larger than the microviscosity of the cor - responding circularized DNA . c [ η ] was never larger than 6 , but one certainly does not see the reptation prediction η ring ≫ η linear at concentrations and molecular weights reached here . Lau , et al . 117 use video tracking to measure the two - particle cross - diﬀusion - coeﬃcients of naturally - occurring particles in the intracellular medium . Comparison is made between one - particle and two - particle measure - ments , each giving a time course of a mean - square dis - placement , in the same cell at the same time . Cell in - teriors are characterized by extensive chemical reactions , and are not equilibrium systems . The observed behav - iors are more complex than would be obtained in a simple viscoelastic medium . For example , in these cells the rel - ative displacement ∆ r of two particles depends on time as h ∆ r 2 ( t ) i ∼ t 1 . 5 . Mason , et al . 118 examine a single 520 nm diameter sphere diﬀusing through 3 wt % 5 MDa polyethylene ox - ide : water and DNA solutions , using laser deﬂection par - ticle tracking to determine the motion of the single probe 10 - 4 10 - 3 10 - 2 10 - 1 10 0 c ( g / L ) 1 10 100 h m / h 0 FIG . 57 : Microviscosity of polystyrene sulfonate combs via particle tracking of 274 nm radius polystyrene latex probes , and ﬁts to stretched exponentials . Polystyrene sulfonates dif - fer in structure , namely ( a ) ( (cid:13) ) 2 . 1 Mda chain with 24 side branches , ( b ) ( ♦ ) same backbone as ( a ) but 3 / 8 as many side chains , ( c ) ( • ) double the backbone length of ( a ) but 5 / 8 as many side chains , and ( d ) ( (cid:3) ) double the backbone length of ( a ) and ≫ 6 times as many side chains , together with forced ﬁts to stretched exponentials , after Papagiannapolis , et al . 119 . particle on which a weak laser beam has been focused . The technique is directly responsive to motion in a plane , variations in the intensity of the light scattered in various directions acting as an optical lever to amplify the time - dependent particle motions . They compare mechanical and DWS measurements of G ′ and G ′′ in the same so - lutions . Direct measurement from their graph indicates the two methods gave values for viscoelastic parameters that agree to within perhaps 30 % , and sometimes better . Papagiannapolis , et al . 119 used diﬀusing wave spec - troscopy and video particle tracking to observe the dif - fusion of polystyrene latex spheres through solutions of fully - neutralized polystyrene sulfonate comb polymers . Probes had 548 nm diameter for particle tracking mea - surements and 112nm diameter for the DWS measure - ments . The combs diﬀered roughly two - fold in their main - chain length , in the number of branches , or in the length of the branches . Video tracking observed motion during times ≥ 3 · 10 − 2 s , during which the mean square displacement increased linearly in time , permitting de - termination of D p and thencefrom the solution viscosity η µ / η o at diﬀerent polymer concentrations . From Figure 57 , changing the number of sidechains at ﬁxed concentra - tion has a very limited eﬀect on η µ , while doubling the length of the backbone at ﬁxed monomer concentration very markedly increases η µ . Fits of η µ to stretched ex - ponentials in c are quite unsatisfactory at low concentra - 35 tion , the measured η µ ( c ) being indistinguishable from the solvent viscosity up to polymer concentrations at which the best - ﬁt stretched exponential predicts η µ ( c ) should be readily distinguishable from unity . Schnurr , et al . 120 demonstrate a novel interference mi - croscopy method for studying probe motion . In their technique , mesoscopic beads are suspended in a solution or gel , their images are identiﬁed through a microscopic , and optical interferometry through the microscope stage taking each bead to be one arm of the interferometer was used to track bead motion . The power spectral density of the displacements and the Kramers - Kronig relation are applied to infer the imaginary and real part of the com - plex shear modulus of the gels . Here silica beads with radii 0 . 25 - 2 . 5 µ m were studied in F - actin and polyacry - lamide gels . Tseng and Wirtz 121 used particle tracking based on video light microscopy to measure the motion of 485 nm radius polystyrene spheres in solutions of F - actin and α - actinin . Mean - square displacements were determined as a function of diﬀusion time and characterized statis - tically . Storage and loss moduli and phase angle were computed from the displacements . The distribution of displacements generally did not have a Gaussian form ; its mean square displacement at long times increased less rapidly than linearly in time . The observed displacement distributions depend in a complex way on the F - actin and α - actinin concentrations . Valentine , et al . 122 used single particle and two - particle tracking methods to examine the diﬀusion of carboxylate - modiﬁed polystyrene spheres in ﬁbrin - F - actin - scruin net - works . The objective was to study the eﬀect of mod - ifying the probe surface chemistry . Diﬀerent spheres were uncoated , heavily coated with bovine serum albu - min , or surface modiﬁed by systematic coupling of large numbers of short methoxy - poly ( ethylene glycol ) groups . Particle motion was examined using video - tracking mi - croscopy . Valentine , et al . , found that the dynamic be - havior of the particles changed very substantially as sur - face treatments were changed . However , particles whose single - particle displacement distributions diﬀer consider - ably due to diﬀerent surface coatings can have very sim - ilar two - particle displacement correlations . Xu , et al . 123 , 124 used mechanical rheology , particle tracking microrheology , and DWS to characterize the rheological properties of actin ﬁlaments . Experimental interests included the concentration dependence of the elastic modulus and the frequency dependence at high frequency of the magnitude of the complex viscoelastic modulus . DWS spectra were interpreted by invoking the Gaussian assumption . Xu , et al . 125 used video tracking microscopy to ob - serve the diﬀusion of 970 nm diameter ﬂuorescent polystyrene spheres through water : glycerol and aqueous wheat gliadin solutions . Increasing the gliadin concentra - tion slows probe diﬀusion . In glycerol , the distribution of particle displacements was a well - behaved gaussian . For probes in gliadin suspensions : At low gliadin con - centrations , measurements of the distribution P ( ∆ R ) of mean - square displacements against time found that dif - ferent particles all had the same P ( ∆ R ) . In contrast , in concentrated gliadin solutions P ( ∆ R ) for diﬀerent parti - cles showed a wide range of diﬀerent time dependences . Correspondingly , at low ( 250 g / L ) gliadin concentrations P ( ∆ R ) at ﬁxed time is a gaussian , but at large ( 400 g / L ) gliadin concentrations P ( ∆ R ) is extremely non - gaussian . D . True Microrheological Measurements This section considers true microrheological measure - ments . In a true rheological measurement , external forces or displacements are imposed , and consequent displace - ments and / or forces are measured . True microrheological measurements , not to be confused with ’microrheology’ studies of Brownian motion , diﬀer from classical macro - scopic rheological studies in that the probes or appara - tus parts function on a mesoscopic length scale . If one believes that probe diﬀusion measurements could be in - verted to obtain η , G ′ , or G ′′ , it becomes interesting to compare those viscosities and moduli both with the cor - responding quantities measured in classical instruments and also with the same quantities measured with true mi - crorheological instruments build on the same size scale as the diﬀusing probes . Amblard , et al 126 used video microscopy and magnetic tweezers to study probe motion in viscoelastic F - actin systems . The probes were polystyrene spheres having radii of 75 , 760 , and 750 nm . Video microscopy deter - mines particle positions ; the tweezers can apply a con - stant force to a particle . The F - actin ﬁlaments at con - centration 0 . 1 g / l had an estimated length of 20 µ m , persistence length ca 14 µ m , and a mesh size ξ ∼ 1 µ m . Video microscopy determined the mean - square displace - ment as a function of time . Magnetic tweezers allowed application of a ﬁxed force , permitting determination of displacement under the inﬂuence of an applied force , also as a function of time . With small beads ( d / ξ < 1 ) , the mean - square distance travelled during diﬀusion followed h x 2 ( t ) i ∼ t 1 . For large beads ( d / ξ > 3 ) , over a range of times 0 . 03 - 2 . 0 s , Amblard , et al . , found h x 2 ( t ) i ∼ t q , with q = 0 . 76 ± 0 . 03 for motion with an external driving force , and with q = 0 . 73 ± 0 . 01 for free diﬀusion . For driven mo - tion , the apparent drag on the probe increases after the probe has travelled 10 - 20 µ m . Use of probe surface coat - ings including streptavidin , surfactant , or bovine serum albumin had no eﬀect on other results . Speciﬁc surface interactions were concluded not to aﬀect these ﬁndings greatly . Here we see a direct demonstration that the drag processes for driven motion and for thermal mo - tion can be the same : The mean - square displacements for both processes scale approximately as t 3 / 4 . The time dependence of the thermal motion is not ∼ t 1 , so the un - derlying thermal particle motion is not simple Brownian diﬀusion . Bishop , et al . 127 studied the driven rotational mo - 36 tion of small spheres inside a model for the intracellular medium . The spheres were 1 - 10 µ m birefringent vaterite ( CaCO 3 ) crystals . The driving force is provided by illu - minating the probes with circularly polarized light , and measuring the degree of polarization of the light after it has passed through the sample . The rotation rate is obtained by examining the transmission of one linear po - larization of the incident light . Bishop , et al . , examined rotational motion of their probes within a drop of hex - ane and in bulk water , ﬁnding that their measured mi - croviscosities were in good agreement with the viscosities measured macroscopically . Hough and Ou - Yang 128 report using optical tweezers to drive the motion of a single 1 . 58 µ m silica micro - sphere through solutions of 85kDa end - capped ( C 12 H 25 - ) polyethylene oxide in water . The tweezer position was driven with piezoelectrically controlled mirrors at fre - quencies as large as 40 , 000 rad / s . Measurements of the magnitude A and phase δ of the sphere oscillations as functions of frequency were inverted , using the model that the sphere is a forced damped harmonic oscillator , to obtained G ′ ( ω ) and G ′′ ( ω ) . The dynamic moduli were ” . . . quite diﬀerent from those obtained by a macroscopic rheometer , and are sensitive to surface treatment of the bead . ” Keller , et al . 129 introduce an oscillatory magnetic bead rheometer , in which 2 . 25 µ m latex beads contain - ing imbedded Fe 2 O 3 are placed in an oscillating mag - netic ﬁeld , and the bead positions are tracked with video microscopy . The amplitude and phase shift of the bead motion are determined , allowing calculation of G ′ ( ω ) and G ′′ ( ω ) . The paper was a proof of principle demonstrating a method for making measurements at higher frequencies ( up to 40 Hz ) , so only a single solution of nondilute F - actin was examined . Schmidt , et al . 130 compare microscopic and macro - scopic measurements of the storage and loss moduli of F - actin and gelsolin solutions . Schmidt , et al . exam - ined F - actin solutions with 0 . 5 ≤ c ≤ 2 g / L , and con - trolled average lengths 1 . 5 ≤ ℓ ≤ 10 µ m , all for frequen - cies 0 . 004 - 4 Hz . The microscopic particles were 4 . 5 µ m paramagnetic beads . These results are from true mi - crorheological measurements : the microspheres were sub - ject to a known external force and the amplitude and phase shift of their motions relative to the driving force were obtained . The macroscopic probe was a rotating disk rheometer . With a viscous small - molecule liquid , microrheology and macrorheology agree as to the mea - sured viscosity . Moduli of F - actin solutions measured microscopically were substantially smaller than moduli measured with a rotating disk rheometer . The network relaxation time estimated from microscopic data is the same as or substantially larger than the time measured with the macroscopic instrument . The frequency depen - dences from microrheological and from macrorheological measurements are somewhat similar , but are clearly not the same : The microrheological measurements typically show stronger dependences of G ′ and G ′′ on ω . 0 . 01 0 . 1 1 10 n ( Hz ) 0 . 1 1 10 G " m a c r o / G " m i c r o FIG . 58 : G ′′ macro / G ′′ micro of F - actin solutions , including pure water ( (cid:13) ) , 2 g / L F - actin solutions with random lengths ( (cid:3) ) , and 2 g / L F - actin solutions with ℓ = 10 µ m ( ♦ ) , using data from Schmidt , et al . 130 , showing that true moduli measured macroscopically and microscopically are unequal . Figure 58 shows representative parts of Schmidt , et al . ’s measurements of G ′′ macro / G ′′ micro . Over a wide range of frequencies , G ′′ macro / G ′′ micro for F - actin solutions is in the range 2 - 8 . Schmidt , et al . 130 cite Maggs 131 as predict - ing similar results . Maggs examined spherical nanoparti - cles diﬀusing through intertwined actin ﬁlaments in solu - tion . Maggs’ model treats probes bending ﬁlaments and distorting the local mesh , using scaling arguments and the presence of two independent length scales , namely the persistence length and the mesh size . The model does not include hydrodynamic interactions between probes and the mesh . The apparent storage and shear moduli are seen to be sensitive to the apparatus length scale . Schmidt , et al . 132 studied the rheological properties of solutions of fd - virus , using classical mechanical and magnetic tweezers rheometry to determine G ′ and G ′′ . Macroscopic and microscopic measurements are reported to be in reasonable agreement . Comparison was made with some modern theoretical calculations 133 ; the ob - served frequency dependence of G ′ at low frequency was much weaker than predicted . Comparison was also made with studies of actin solutions , permitting separation of fundamental physical properties from peculiarities of par - ticular chemical systems . Schmidt , et al . , observe that actin aggregation is extremely sensitive to a wide variety of proteins and other environmental factors . They pro - pose that a practical way to avoid these challenges to the use of F - actin solutions as a model for testing theories of polymer solution dynamics is to use alternative physical systems , such as the fd - virus that they studied , as sound 37 models for testing theories of polymer solution dynamics . From the published literature , in small - molecule liq - uids true microrheology and classical measurements give the same results . In many though not all polymer solu - tions , true microrheology and classical rheometry do not agree , the viscosity measured with true microrheology generally being smaller than the viscosity determined by a classical , macroscopic rheometer . Particle tracking gives direct access to correlation func - tions h ∆ ~ R ( t 1 , t 2 ) ∆ ~ R ( t 3 , t 4 ) i . These functions in turn give access to the memory functions for the Langevin - equation ’random’ force in ways that light scattering spectroscopy does not . Bandwidth for video tracking presently limits that technique , but bandwidth improve - ments are a matter of time , and alternative paths to de - termining displacements ∆ ~ R ( t 1 , t 2 ) exist 120 . E . Probes in Gels and Biological Systems True gels are not solutions . However , some mod - els of polymer solution dynamics invoke analogies with polymer motion through gels , at least on favorable time scales , so it is clearly worthwhile to compare probe mo - tion through polymer solutions with polymer motion through true gels . Much work has focused on ( 1 ) cross - linked polyacrylamide gels and ( 2 ) cross - linked actin and other protein gels , but there are also results on ( 3 ) probes in the complex interior of living cells and other gelling systems . 1 . Probes in Polyacrylamide Gels Allain , et al . 134 studied the diﬀusion of 0 . 176 µ m diameter polystyrene spheres through solutions of acrylamide / N , N’ - methylene bisacrylamide during irre - versible gel formation . QELSS was used to measure the relaxation spectra of the probes , which dominated the scattering by their host solutions . The probe diﬀusion time τ ∼ D − 1 p was obtained from a second order cumu - lant ﬁt to the spectra . During the gelation process , τ of the probes increased 120 - fold with increasing duration of the gelation process . Over the same time interval , the macroscopic solution viscosity increased only 12 - fold , so the probe diﬀusion time was not simply proportional to the macroscopic viscosity . Matsukawa and Ando 135 used PFG NMR to study polyethylene glycol and water diﬀusing through fully swollen cross - linked polyacrylamide gels . PEG molec - ular weights were 4 . 25 , 10 . 89 , and 20 kDa . D p was taken to be proportional to D po exp ( − κR ) , where κ is a gel length scale that could be varied by changing the degree of swelling . Nishio , et al . 136 used QELSS to monitor the diﬀusion of polystyrene latex spheres in polyacrylamide : water . Probe radii were 25 and 50 nm . Probes were added to the solutions prior to adding the ammonium persulphonate polymerization initiator . The fraction concentration of bisacrylamide crosslinker was varied from zero ( leading to linear polyacrylamide solutions ) to 5 % ( leading to a strong gel ) . Under ﬁxed optical conditions , the extent to which the correlation function decayed at long times decreased with increasing crosslinker concentration and with decreasing scattering angle , indicating that above 1 . 6 % bisacrylamide more and more particles are conﬁned , especially over longer distances . Nishio , et al . make an inversion of their data to determine the distribution of eﬀective pore lengths for diﬀerent probe radii ( and , im - plicitly , pore diameters ) showing that the distribution is quite wide . Park , et al . 137 used holographic relaxation spec - troscopy to measure D p of a dye and a labelled protein through polyacrylamide gels as a function of polyacry - lamide concentration c . The holographic method mea - sures diﬀusion over distances orders of magnitude larger than any structure in the gel . QELSS was used to in - fer a nominal correlation length ξ for the gels from their apparent diﬀusion coeﬃcient D via D = k B T 6 πηξ , ( 21 ) where k B is Boltzmann’s constant , T is the absolute tem - perature , and η is the solvent viscosity . On comparison with literature data on diﬀusion by D 2 O , sucrose , and urea through the same medium , Park , et al ﬁnd from their measurements that the probe diﬀusion coeﬃcient D p depends on c and probe radius R via D p = D po exp ( − ac ν R δ ) ( 22 ) for ν ≈ 0 . 94 and δ ≈ 0 . 59 . That is , Park , et al . found that real polyacrylamide gels are size ﬁlters that selec - tively retard the diﬀusion of larger probe particles . Park , et al . also ﬁnd from QELSS measurements on gels that ξ ∼ c − 0 . 64 , leading them to note that D p / D po is to good approximation a function of the single variable RC / ξ . Reina , et al . 138 used QELSS to measure the diﬀusion of 25 and 50 nm radius PSL probe particles in polyacry - lamide solutions and cross - linked polyacrylamide gels over a range of polymer concentrations and scattering an - gles . In simple solutions , the probe spectrum is close to a single exponential , whose decay rate falls with increasing polymer c until the gel threshold is reached . Above the threshold , a second slow mode appears ; the relaxation rates of both modes then increase with increasing poly - mer concentration . At the threshold , particle trapping becomes evident from the lack of complete relaxation of the scattering spectrum . Above the threshold , a complex q - dependence of the spectrum determined by the probe diameter and the gel mesh spacing is observed . Suzuki and Nishio 139 examined 60 nm radius PSL spheres in polyacrylamide gels , determining the extent to which the spectrum decays toward zero as t → ∞ , and the dependence of the spectrum on monomer concen - tration and scattering angle . Spectra were polymodal . 38 0 10 20 30 R ( nm ) 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 1 . 2 D p / D p0 FIG . 59 : Diﬀusion 141 of ﬁcoll probes through solutions of overlapped F - actin chains at actin concentrations 1 ( (cid:13) ) , 3 ( (cid:3) ) , 5 ( ♦ ) , 8 ( △ ) , and 12 ( (cid:4) ) g / L , and a ﬁt to a single joint stretched exponential in c and R . Qualitative properties of spectra were interpreted from physical models . 2 . Probes in Protein Gels Fadda , et al . 140 used QELSS and static light scatter - ing to monitor the diﬀusion of 225 nm radius polystyrene latex probes through gelatin solutions during the gela - tion process . Static light scattering determined the par - ticle radius . The presence of a deep ﬁrst minimum in I ( q ) showed that the particles were highly monodisperse . The spectrum h I ( 0 ) I ( τ ) i of the probes was monitored as a function of time t after quenching from high to low temperature . The spectrum was approximated as a pure exponential at small τ and a stretched exponential in τ at large τ . When gelation set in , the short - time decay be - came faster , the long - time decay became very long , and a normalized measure of spectral intensity fell . Compar - ison was made with particular models of gel formation . Hou , et al . 141 used probe diﬀusion measured with FRAP to examine several physical models of the intra - cellular medium . While simpler model systems contain - ing either globular particles or long chains did not re - produce the behavior of probes moving in vitro , probes diﬀusing through a mixture of globular and long - chain proteins did show most physical properties seen with in vivo probe diﬀusion studies . The probe particles were a series of ﬂuorescently - tagged size fractionated ﬁcolls . The background matrix included concentrated globular particles ( ﬁcolls or bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) ) and / or heavily overlapped F - actin ﬁlaments . The experimental focus was studying nine probes in each of a few solu - tions , so concentration dependences for D p were exam - ined imprecisely . Probes diﬀusing through solutions of globular particles showed a D / D o that was only weakly dependent on probe radius R h . For probes in these so - lutions , D / D o was always larger than η o / η , Dη / D o η o increasing with increasing solution viscosity . In con - trast , D / D o of probes diﬀusing through F - actin solutions falls markedly with increasing probe radius , but extrap - olates to D / D o = 1 as R h → 0 . Figure 59 shows the nine probes diﬀusing through heavily overlapped actin matrix solutions . A joint ﬁt of all measurements gave D / D 0 = 1 . 21 exp ( − 0 . 067 R 0 . 55 c 0 . 38 ) , as shown . Hou , et al . 141 compared their results with ﬁndings of Luby - Phelps , et al . 142 , 143 on probes in the cytoplasm of living cells . In living cells , D / D o depends strongly on probe radius R h but extrapolates to D / D o ≈ 0 . 3 as R h → 0 . In contrast to results in in vivo probes , probes in simple ﬁcoll and bovine serum albumin solutions have a D / D o that is substantially independent of R h . Probes in F - actin solutions have D / D o ≈ 1 in the limit of small R h . However , probes in a mixture of F - actin and con - centrated ( 7 - 10 % ) ﬁcoll or concentrated ( 7 % ) BSA show the same properties as probes in cytoplasm , showing that probe diﬀusion in cytoplasm is plausibly governed by the simultaneous presence of a network phase and concen - trated globular macromolecules . Madonia , et al . 144 prepared nongelling and gelling hemoglobin solutions and used QELSS to watch the dif - fusion through them of 43 and 250 nm radius probe par - ticles . At the onset of gelation , D p of the 250 nm probes falls rapidly . Under identical experimental conditions , as gelation proceeds D p of the 43 nm spheres increases slightly . The gel structure functions as a size ﬁlter , trap - ping the larger particles but not obstructing signiﬁcantly the motions of the smaller particles . Newman , et al . 145 used QELSS to monitor the dif - fusion of polystyrene latex spheres through F - actin so - lutions . Four probe species with radii of 55 , 110 , 270 , and 470 nm were employed . Actins were polymerized with MgCl 2 , KCl , or CaCl 2 ; however , all samples stud - ied were liquids , not gels . Prior to polymerization , D p in the actin solutions was not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from D p of the same probe in pure water . On addition of salt to start the polymerization process , D p of the latex spheres began to fall , and the second cumulant of the probe spectra began to increase , showing that the distri - bution of probe displacements is no longer a Gaussian . Changes in spectral parameters stop after several hours . D p was determined for all probes , actin concentrations 1 ≤ c ≤ 20 µ M , and several scattering angles . D p in so - lutions polymerized with Mg or Ca followed a stretched exponential D p / D p 0 = exp ( − αc ν R δ ) for ν = 1 . 08 ± 0 . 09 and δ = 0 . 73 ± 0 . 05 . In contrast , for probes in solutions polymerized with K , one ﬁnds δ ≈ 0 . Newman , et al . 146 used QELSS to examine the diﬀu - sion of PSL spheres ( radii 55 , 105 , and 265 nm ) through 39 solutions of polymerized actin . The actin concentration was ﬁxed at 0 . 65 g / L throughout the experiments . Ad - dition of gelsolin , a protein that interacts with actin to shorten the actin ﬁlaments , was used to determine the eﬀect of actin ﬁlament length on probe diﬀusion at constant total actin concentration . Analysis of QELSS spectra indicated that if little gelsolin was present the actin network trapped many probe particles , at least over long distance scales . Trapping was more eﬀective for the larger probe particles . On shortening the actin ﬁlament length by adding gelsolin , the probe diﬀusion coeﬃcient increased and the trapping vanished . The inferred micro - viscosity fell from 5 - 20 times that of water when actin ﬁl - aments were very long ( no added gelsolin ) down to twice that of water at the largest gelsolin concentration ex - amined . After addition of gelsolin , changing the probe radius ﬁve - fold had little eﬀect on the inferred microvis - cosity . Addition of gelsolin changed modestly the probe spectrum line shape : the second spectral cumulant was large at very low gelsolin concentration , when some par - ticles were trapped , but dropped a great deal when all probes were free to diﬀuse . Schmidt , et al . 147 , as part of an extremely system - atic study of actin dynamics , examined the diﬀusion of 35 , 50 , and 125 nm radius latex spheres through fully polymerized actin networks . The actin networks were also characterized using QELSS , FRAP , and electron mi - croscopy . Sphere diﬀusion through the networks followed D p = D o exp ( − αc ν R δ ) with prefactor α ≈ 1 , and ex - ponents ν ≈ 1 and δ ≈ 2 . For actin concentrations 0 < c ≤ 2 mg / ml , 125 nm radius spheres were retarded by up to sixfold , while the concentration dependence of D p of the smaller spheres was weak . Over the range of radii studied , namely R comparable with the mesh spac - ing seen in an electron micrograph , heavily interlaced networks of actin molecules act as size ﬁlters , selectively retarding the motion of the larger probe particles . Stewart , et al . 148 used holographic relaxation spec - troscopy ( HRS ) to monitor the diﬀusion of dye and tagged proteins through ﬁbrin gels . In an HRS exper - iment , a pair of crossed laser beams are used to bleach a holographic pattern in solution , creating an index of refraction grating formed from unbleached molecules , and perhaps separate gratings formed from bleached , photochromically modiﬁed , or photochemically bound molecules . Stewart , et al . found that small dye molecules diﬀused through ﬁbrin gels as if they were in pure water . The diﬀusion of labelled BSA molecules was retarded by the gel , though less so if the gel was formed in the pres - ence of Ca + 2 , while in contrast the photobleaching reac - tion caused some labelled immunoglobulin G molecules to bind to the ﬁbrin gel and become immobile . Wong , et al . 149 study diﬀusion of probe particles in F - actin networks , using video tracking microscopy to ob - serve particle motion . Mean - square displacements were measured directly . They were not diﬀusive : h ( ∆ x ) 2 i was not ∼ t 1 . Examination of the motions of individ - ual particles showed that particle dynamics were het - erogenous . While the motion of some particles showed complete trapping , the particle never moving far from its starting point , the motions of other particles showed only partial trapping : particles alternately were trapped within restricted regions and made rare saltatory jumps to other trapping regions . Diﬀusion by 250 , 320 , and 500 nm radius polystyrene spheres was compared with the diﬀusive exponent γ of h ( ∆ x ) 2 i ∼ t γ for networks at a series of F - actin concentrations , showing that γ is a uni - versal function of R / ξ , with probe radius R and network mesh size ξ . 3 . Probes in Living Cells and Other Systems Arrio - Dupont 150 used a ﬂuorescence recovery tech - nique to measure the diﬀusion of a series of ﬂuorescently - labeled proteins through the interior of cultured muscle cells . Probe radii extended from 1 . 3 to 7 . 2 nm . Cellular interiors are size ﬁlters , selective obstructing the diﬀusion of the larger probes . The retardation of the diﬀusion of larger globular proteins by the cell interiors is substan - tially more extensive than the retardation of similarly large dextrans by the same interiors 151 , perhaps because dextrans are ﬂexible and globular proteins are inﬂexible . Kao , et al . 152 used ﬂuorescence recovery after photo - bleaching and picosecond resolution ﬂuorescence polar - ization measurements to determine translational and ro - tational diﬀusion coeﬃcients and fractional ﬂuorescence recovery levels of ﬂuorescein derivatives in Swiss 3T3 ﬁ - broblasts and viscous solutions . Careful analysis permit - ted separate determination of the ﬂuid - phase viscosity , the level of probe binding , and the inhibition of probe diﬀusion due to the cell volume occupied by the relatively immobile cytomatrix . The combination of these eﬀects accounts for the retardation of small - molecule solutes by cellular interiors . Luby - Phelps 143 and collaborators used FRAP to study the diﬀusion of a series of fractionated ﬁcolls , both in the cytoplasm of 3T3 cells and in concentrated ( 10 - 26 % ) protein solutions . Ficoll fractions had hydrodynamic di - ameters 60 - 250 ˚ A . D p / D o of ﬁcolls in protein solutions was independent of the size of the ﬁcoll molecules . That is , protein solutions are not size ﬁlters ; they retard to approximately the same fractional extent the diﬀusion of small and large probe particles . In contrast , cell cy - toplasm is a size ﬁlter . D p / D o of ﬁcolls in cytoplasm falls sixfold as the ﬁcoll diameter is increased from 60 to 500 ˚ A . For the largest ﬁcoll , FRAP ﬁnds that a third of the ﬁcoll particles are trapped by cytoplasm ; only 2 / 3 of the particles are able to diﬀuse through substantial dis - tances . Luby - Phelps , et al . propose that objects larger than 500 ˚ A or so are mechanically prevented from diﬀus - ing through cell cytoplasms . Luby - Phelps , et al . 153 describe a ﬂuorometric method using two homologous dyes for determination of the local solvent viscosity , and apply the technique to determine the viscosity of water in the cytoplasm of a cell . The 40 ﬂuorometric behavior of one dye ( but not the other ) is sensitive to the local solvent mobility , while both dyes are approximately equally responsive to other environmental inﬂuences . The dyes were bound to ﬁcoll for microinjec - tion purposes . It was found that the solvent viscosity is not greatly diﬀerent from the viscosity of bulk water , resolving a long and well - known literature dispute . Seksek , et al . 154 studied the diﬀusion of labelled dex - trans and ﬁcolls within ﬁbroblasts and epithelial cells us - ing FRAP . Dextrans had molecular weights 4 , 10 , 20 , 40 , 70 , 150 , 580 , and 200 kDa . Ficolls were size - fractionated , four fractions being used for further studies . Probes were microinjected into cells . With large probes , the cy - toplasm and nucleus can be studied separately . Small probes pass through the nuclear membrane , so nucleus and cytoplasm had to be studied simultaneously . In MDCK cells , D p / D po did not depend on the size of the probes . Seksek found that under some conditions pro - cesses other than translational diﬀusion could lead to photobleaching recovery . Probe diﬀusion measurements are often said to be re - lated to the phenomena that control the release of medi - cal drugs from semirigid gels . Shenoy and Rosenblatt 155 provide an example in which release times are mea - sured directly . They examined succinylated collagen and hyaluronic acid matrices , separately and in mixtures , us - ing bovine serum albumin and dextran as the probes whose diﬀusion was to be measured . F . Probe Spectra Interpreted with the Gaussian Assumption This section notes a series of papers , sometimes linked under the cognomen microrheology , that rely on the as - sertion that the incoherent structure factor for the diﬀu - sion of dilute probes through a viscoelastic matrix may in general be rewritten via h exp ( i q · r i i = exp ( − q 2 h r 2 i / 2 ) , the so - called ’gaussian assumption’ . As noted above , this assumption is incorrect except in a certain very special case . The special case in which this assertion is correct is the case in which the incoherent structure factor is characterized by a single pure exponential , so that − log ( h exp ( i q · r i i ) is linear in t . Interpretations based on the Gaussian assumption , when applied to non - exponential spectra , are therefore highly suspect . Bellour , et al . 156 used DWS to measure probe diﬀusion of 0 . 27 , 0 . 5 , 1 , and 1 . 5 µ m radius polystyrene spheres in solutions of cetyltrimethylammonium ( CTA ) bromide and sodium hexane sulphonate , in some cases after ion exchange removal of the Br − . CTA salts in aqueous so - lutions form giant extended ﬂexible micelles . At elevated surfactant concentrations , the micelles are nondilute and potentially entwine . However , unlike regular polymers , the micelles have a lifetime for a mid - length scission pro - cess that eﬀectively permits micelles to pass through each other . At elevated surfactant concentrations , the DWS spectrum had a bimodal relaxation form . Dasgupta , et al . 157 used DWS and QELSS to study polystyrene spheres diﬀusing through 200 and 900 kDa polyethylene oxide solutions . A wide range of polymer concentrations , 15 c ∗ − 45 c ∗ was examined , taking c ∗ of the two polymers to be 0 . 48 and 0 . 16 wt % , respectively . Polystyrene probes had radii 230 , 320 , 325 , 485 , and 1000 nm , the PSL being carboxylate - modiﬁed except for the 325 nm probes , which were sulphate modiﬁed . QELSS spectra were interpreted by invoking the ’Gaussian’ as - sumption , even though the nominal ( ∆ x ( t ) ) 2 was clearly not linear in t . QELSS spectra were truncated and only reported for times longer than 10 mS . Gisler and Weitz 158 used diﬀusing wave spectroscopy to examine the motion of polystyrene spheres through F - actin solutions . The Gaussian assumption was invoked to convert DWS spectra to nominal mean - square parti - cle displacements . The inferred displacements were then used to infer viscoelastic properties of F - actin gels . Heinemann , et al . 159 used diﬀusing wave spectroscopy to examine 720 nm polystyrene latex spheres mov - ing through aqueous solutions of potato starch , using γ - dodecalactone to induced aggregation of the starch molecules . DWS spectra were inverted by invoking the gaussian approximation . Inverted spectra were used to generate nominal values for the storage and loss moduli as functions of frequency . Kao , et al . 160 used diﬀusing wave spectroscopy , in a specialized instrument in which the digital correlator is replaced by a Michelson interferometer , to examine the diﬀusion of 103 - 230 nm radius colloidal spheres over the ﬁrst 20 nS of their displacements . The Gaussian approx - imation for particle displacements in quasielastic scatter - ing was invoked . Kaplan , et al . 161 use DWS to study structure forma - tion in alkyl ketene dimer emulsions . Spectra were in - terpreted by invoking the Gaussian assumption . These systems are used in paper manufacture as sizing agents , but lead to technical diﬃculties if they gel . The scat - tering particles were intrinsically present in the system . The time evolution of spectra over a period of weeks was observed . Within a few days , systems that were going to gel could readily be distinguished from those that would remain stable . It is important to emphasize that even if a measurable is not simply related to underlying physical properties , the measurable may still represent a valuable practical analytical tool for industrial purposes . Knaebel , et al . 162 used DWS , static light scattering , small - angle neutron scattering , and mechanical rheom - etry to characterize an alkali - soluble emulsion system . These solutions exhibit shear thinning and thixotropic behavior . The low - shear viscosity increases dramatically with increasing concentration , up to a limiting concen - tration beyond which η increases more slowly with in - creasing c . The DWS measurements were analyzed by invoking the Gaussian assumption . Lu and Solomon 163 use DWS to measure the diﬀu - sion of 0 . 2 to 2 . 2 µ m polystyrene spheres and 0 . 25 µ m colloidal silica beads in solutions of hydrophobically - 41 modiﬁed ethoxylated urethane , which is an associating polymer , at polymer concentrations 0 - 4 wt % . Mechanical rheology measurements were made on the same systems . DWS measurements were analyzed using the Gaussian displacement assumption . From the reported nominal h ∆ r 2 ( t ) i , the underlying single - scattering spectrum was not a pure exponential . Mason and Weitz 164 applied DWS to study the diﬀu - sion of 420 nm polystyrene spheres , at large concentra - tion in ethylene glycol ( φ = 0 . 56 ) , at lower concentration ( φ = 0 . 02 ) , and in a 15 wt % solution of 4 MDa polyethy - lene oxide . The Gaussian assumption was used to con - vert g ( 1 ) ( q , t ) to a mean square particle displacement and thence to a ’time - dependent diﬀusion coeﬃcient’ . A gen - eralized Stokes - Einstein equation translated the diﬀusion coeﬃcient into microscopic storage and loss moduli . Narita , et al . 165 used DWS and QELSS to study probe diﬀusion in solutions of 95 kDa polyvinylalcohol ( PVA ) and crosslinked PVA gels . The probes were 107 and 535 nm PSL spheres . QELSS spectra were visibly bimodal at all polymer concentrations studied . The relaxation time of the fast QELSS mode was diﬀusive . The slow mode showed a stronger - than - q 2 dependence of its linewidth . DWS spectra lacked visible long - time shoulders , and were interpreted using the Gaussian assumption . Nisato , et al . 166 use QELSS and DWS to examine 85 and 107 nm polystyrene latex probe spheres in poly - acrylic acid gels that had been chemically - crosslinked by addition of methylene bis - acrylamide . DWS spectra were reported for forward and backward scattering geometries , nominally giving determinations of motion on two diﬀer - ent length scales . QELSS spectra had a long - time limit that was far above the baseline calculated from the mean scattering intensity . The Gaussian assumption was used to infer from the long - time limit of the dynamic struc - ture factor a long - time limit of the mean displacement h ∆ r 2 ( ∞ ) i ; the assumption was also applied to interpret DWS spectra . Palmer , et al . 167 used DWS to study the motions of 480 nm radius latex spheres in actin and actin : α - actinin solutions . They reported spectra , nominal mean - square displacements , time - dependent diﬀusion coeﬃcients , and magnitude of the complex modulus as inferred from a generalized Stokes - Einstein equation . A Gaussian as - sumption was used to interpret spectra . Palmer , et al . 168 used DWS to examine the diﬀusion of 480 nm radius polystyrene beads through F - actin , con - centrations 0 . 42 - 6 . 89 g / l . The Gaussian assumption was invoked to analyze spectra in terms of mean - square dis - placements and inferred frequency dependent viscoelas - tic moduli . The authors also measured G ′ and G ′′ with a mechanical rheometer , and compare with the DWS data . Pine , et al . 169 presented the ﬁrst experimental demon - stration of DWS as applied to complex ﬂuids , based on the earlier study of Maret and Wolf 170 on dynamic light scattering in the multiple - scattering limit . The Gaus - sian assumption was implicit in their use of the earlier work of Maret and Wolf 170 . DWS was ﬁrst applied to a 0 . 01 volume fraction solution of 497 nm diameter PSL spheres diﬀusing freely in water , showing excellent agree - ment between the measured spectrum and the predicted theoretical form for the DWS spectrum , if the photon transport mean free path ℓ ∗ was used as a ﬁtting param - eter . Pine , et al . , report that ℓ ∗ from their dynamic mea - surements was consistently smaller than inferred from static backscattering measurements . Comparison was made with mixtures of 312 and 497 nm diameter spheres ( volume fractions 0 . 01 , 0 . 04 , respectively ) that had been deionized to produce a colloidal glass . The DWS spec - trum changed markedly on formation of the glass . Popescu , et al . 171 present a novel QELSS apparatus , based on their earlier analysis 172 , that uses extremely - short - coherence - length visible light in its measurements . In Popescu , et al . ’s method , light from a superlumines - cent diode with a coherence length of 30 µ m was sent per - pendicular to the window surface into a scattering vol - ume . Light , backscattered from particles that are located within a few coherence lengths of the surface , combines coherently with light back - reﬂected by the window , al - lowing measurement in heterodyne mode of the QELSS spectrum , even of highly scattering samples . Popescu’s analysis invokes the Gaussian assumption ’for times much shorter than the decaying time of the autocorrelation function’ . Sohn , et al . 173 present a theoretical analysis of Popescu , et al . 171 , 172 ’s microvolume QELSS apparatus , based on invoking the Gaussian assumption . The possi - bility of working directly in frequency domain , and de - scribing the spectrum as a sum of Lorentzians rather than a sum of exponentials , is examined . Rojas - Ochoa , et al . 174 make a systematic study of DWS spectra of monodisperse interacting hard sphere systems . Small - angle neutron scattering was used to de - termine the sphere size and the static structure factor , which was signiﬁcantly perturbed by interparticle inter - actions . The photon transport mean free path was deter - mined directly by measuring the optical transmittance of samples of various thicknesses . The hydrodynamic radius of the spheres was obtained via QELSS applied to dilute samples . DWS was used to measure particle motions over a few to a few hundred microseconds . The solvent was Newtonian . Under these conditions , which would not arise in a viscoelastic matrix solution , the Gaussian assumption is applicable . Comparison of this no - free - parameter determination of D p with predictions of or - thodox theory for the concentration dependence of D p found excellent agreement . Thus , under the very restric - tive conditions under which the theoretical models for D p and diﬀusing wave spectroscopy are applicable , the model gives good results . Romer , et al . 175 used DWS to study gel formation in colloid preparations . Gelation was induced by varying the solution ionic strength , using enzymatic degradation of a neutral organic compound to create a slow change uniform across the sample in the ionic strength of the solution . The Gaussian assumption was invoked to con - 42 vert DWS spectra to determinations of the mean - square displacement of individual particles , even though parti - cles in gelling systems have long - time correlations in the forces on them , so that the nominal h ( ∆ r ) 2 i from DWS for identical particles in a gelling system is not linear in time . Romer , et al . 176 present additional DWS and clas - sical mechanical rheology measurements on the same sys - tem , showing that DWS and rheometric properties show dramatic changes after similar elapsed times , the elapsed time being characteristic of the system’s sol - gel transi - tion . Rufener , et al . 177 used DWS to study concentrated G - actin that had been systematically polymerized into F - actin . The Gaussian assumption was invoked to interpret spectra of polystyrene sphere probes . Spectra of small probes decayed to the expected baseline . Spectra of large probes decayed only part way to the expected baseline , leading to the inference that large but not small spheres were trapped by the gel network . van der Gucht , et al . 178 used QELSS to study the diﬀusion of 125 and 250 nm radius modiﬁed silica particles in solutions of the self - assembling monomer bis ( ethylhexylureido ) toluene . They also measured the low - concentration viscosity , dynamic shear moduli , and static light scattering intensity . Concentration - driven self - association gives η ( c ) a peculiar form : η ( c ) is nearly constant out to a crossover concentration c ∗ = 0 . 11g / L monomer , and then increases as a power law in c . QELSS spectra were relatively unimodal at low polymer concen - tration , but gain a slow mode at larger c . The concentra - tion at which the slow mode appears is nearly an order of magnitude larger than c ∗ . Light scattering spectra were interpreted using the Gaussian assumption even when spectra were clearly not single exponentials . van Zanten , et al . 179 used DWS to examine 195 , 511 , 739 , 966 , and 1550 nm diameter PSL spheres diﬀusing in 330 kDa polyethylene oxide : water solutions for PEO con - centrations 0 . 2 ≤ c ≤ 15 wt % , the Gaussian assumption being invoked . A cone and plate viscometer was used to study transient creep and dynamic oscillatory responses . IV . SYSTEMATICS A . Systems Here we have examined the literature on the diﬀusion of probes through polymer solutions . Nearly 200 probe size : polymer molecular weight combinations were ex - amined at a range of polymer concentrations . There is a solid but not extremely extensive body of work on the temperature dependence of probe diﬀusion in polymer solutions . A half - dozen studies of probe rotational mo - tion and more than a dozen reports based on particle tracking are noted , along with a half - dozen sets of true microrheological measurements , in which mesoscopic ob - jects perform driven motion in polymer solutions . Two dozen studies of diﬀusion in which spectra are interpreted using the ”gaussian approximation” are identiﬁed . As itemized in Tables I - V , probes have included polystyrene spheres , divinylbenzene - styrene spheres , sil - ica spheres , tobacco mosaic virus , bovine serum albumin , ovalbumin , starburst dendrimers , ﬂuorescein , hematite particles , unilamellar vesicles , micelles , ﬁcols , PBLG rods , and low - molecular weight dextrans . Polystyrene spheres , ﬁcols , and dextrans were used in the bulk of the probe measurements . Matrix polymer chains include a wide range of water - soluble polymers . Only limited data exist on probes in solutions of the organophilic polymers that form the staple for the remainder of the polymer literature . Rotational motion measurements require the use of ori - entationally anisotropic objects . Rodlike particles in - clude tobacco mosaic virus , collagen , actin fragments , and PBLG . Optically anisotropic spheres , the anisotropy arising from oriented internal domains or magnetite in - clusions , were examined by Cush , et al . 101 , 102 and Sohn , et al . 173 . Results on probe diﬀusion fall into three phenomeno - logical classes . In the ﬁrst two classes , diﬀusion is use - fully characterized by a single relaxation time and hence a well - deﬁned probe diﬀusion coeﬃcient . In the third class , light scattering spectra are more complex . The classes are : ( i ) Systems in which D p decreases as c is increased , with dD p / dc monotonically growing more negative with increasing c . ( ii ) Systems showing re - entrant concentration behav - ior , in which over some concentration range D p ﬁrst increases with increasing c and perhaps then decreases again . ( iii ) Systems whose spectra have bimodal or trimodal relaxations , corresponding to the relaxation of probe con - centration ﬂuctuations via several competing modes . We begin with systems having a well - deﬁned D p . B . Temperature Dependence In systems in which the solvent quality does not change strongly with temperature , D p scales with temperature as T / η s , η s being the ( temperature - dependent ) solvent viscosity . This result applies equally to probes in solu - tions containing no polymer , in which probe - solvent in - teractions govern diﬀusion , and to probes in concentrated polymer solutions , in which probe - polymer interactions however mediated must dominate the diﬀusion process . Studies conﬁrming this result include Bremmell , et al . 16 on probes in water : glycerol and Phillies , et al . 50 , 51 , 52 on probes in aqueous polyacrylic acids and aqueous dex - trans . Phillies and Quinlan 52 observed slight deviations from simple T / η s behavior for probes in water : dextran , which they interpret in terms of a temperature depen - dence of the solvent quality . Because D p in general simply tracks the temperature dependence of T / η s , one infers that solvent - based hy - 43 drodynamic forces play a dominant role in probe diﬀu - sion . Unfortunately , this inference says very little about the nature of polymer solution dynamics , because mod - els for polymer solution dynamics largely agree on pre - dicting an inverse dependence of relaxation rates on the solvent viscosity : Changing the solvent viscosity changes the mobility of individual polymer subunits , the so - called monomer mobility , thus changing the rate at which poly - mer chains can form or release hypothesized chain entan - glements . Changing the solvent viscosity equally changes the strength of probe - chain hydrodynamic interactions , thus changing the forces coupling the motion of a probe and of nearby chains . Temperature dependence studies do rule out one entire class of approaches , namely ap - proaches referring to reduction relative to a glass tem - perature T g . Analyses of D p uniformly compare mea - surements made at ﬁxed T , and not at ﬁxed T − T g . T g is claimed to depend very strongly on c , so measurements at ﬁxed T and diﬀerent c are claimed to have very dif - ferent T − T g . It was proposed that comparisons should be made at ﬁxed T − T g , not ﬁxed T , and comparisons made at ﬁxed T are not valid . To determine T g , thereby allowing comparisons at ﬁxed T − T g albeit diﬀerent T , Phillies , et al . 50 , 51 , 52 measured D p at ﬁxed c over a range of T . After removing from D p the dependence of η s on T , the remnant T - dependence of D p could have revealed how T g depends on c . Comparing results at ﬁxed T − T g would eliminate any c - dependence of D p arising from the c - dependence of T g . Phillies , et al . 50 , 51 , 52 actually found that after removing from D p the dependence of η s on T , there is no remnant T - dependence of D p to inter - pret . Correspondingly , either T g is independent of c , or the notion ’reduction relative to the glass temperature’ is fundamentally inapplicable to probe diﬀusion in polymer solutions . In either case , the data serve to reject the use of glass temperature corrections as a part of interpreting D p ( c ) . Changes in temperature may also change the solvent quality and hence the radius of each polymer coil . Clome - nil and Phillies 82 examined probes in HPC : water at dif - ferent temperatures , including temperatures at which water is a good solvent for HPC and temperatures ap - proaching the pseudotheta transition . Corresponding to the change in solvent quality with temperature , the de - pendence of D p on polymer concentration is markedly temperature dependent . Unfortunately , as detailed in Ref . 82 , the observed dependence is equally consistent with most models of polymer solutions , so these results do not sort between diﬀerent models of polymer dynam - ics . C . Probe Diﬀusion and the Solution Viscosity The relationship between D p and the solution viscosity was a primary motivation for early studies of probe dif - fusion . In some systems though not others , D p does not scale inversely as the solution viscosity measured macro - scopically , so that D p η depends strongly on polymer con - centration and polymer molecular weight . In almost all systems showing deviations from Stokes - Einsteinian be - havior , D p η increases with increasing c , sometimes by large factors . Probe particles generally diﬀuse faster than expected from the solution viscosity . From the experi - mental standpoint , this sign for the discrepancy between D p and η leads to a marked simpliﬁcation , because the obvious experimental artifacts such as probe aggregation and polymer adsorption all lead to probes that diﬀuse too slowly , not too swiftly as actually observed . In simple ﬂuids , the probe diﬀusion coeﬃcient follows the Stokes - Einstein equation with D p ∼ 1 / η . If the Stokes - Einstein equation remained valid in polymer so - lutions , D p would accurately track the solution viscosity , so that measuring D p would simply be a replacement for classical rheological measurements . Indeed , the early work of Turner and Hallet 1 found that η µ inferred from D p is very nearly equal to η measured classically with a rotating drum viscometer . In contrast , a substantial mo - tivation driving Lin and Phillies 37 , 38 , 39 to extend their probe diﬀusion work was that in their systems η µ was very deﬁnitely not equal to the macroscopic η , even for very large probes . The diﬀerences between the works of Turner and Hallet , and of Lin and Phillies , apparently reﬂect diﬀerences between chemical systems . Probes in small - M polymer solutions generally show Stokes - Einsteinian behavior with η µ ≈ η , including 160 nm spheres 19 in 101 - 445 kDa PMMA : CHCl 3 for η / η s up to 10 , 20 and 230 nm probes in aque - ous 20 kDa dextran 45 , and 20 - 1500 nm spheres in aqueous 50 kDa polyacrylic acid 39 . On the other hand , 49 and 80 nm probes in aqueous 90 kDa poly - L - lysine 42 show small c - independent deviations from Stokes - Einsteinian behavior . Stokes - Einsteinian behav - ior is also found in some large - M systems . Onyene - mezu , et al . 43 ﬁnd Stokes - Einsteinian behavior within experimental accuracy for 1100 kDa polystyrene solu - tions having η / η s as large as 100 . Turner and Hallett 1 and Phillies , et al . 45 reveal η µ / η ≈ 1 in dextran solu - tions even with M as large as 2 MDa . In most non - dilute polymer solutions , non - Stokes - Einsteinian behav - ior is found 20 , 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 34 , 38 , 39 , 42 , 47 , 56 , 57 , 58 , 79 , often leading at large c to η µ ≪ η and r H ≪ R . A par - ticularly conspicuous example of non - Stokes - Einsteinian behavior appears in Fig . 21 , based on Lin and Phillies 39 , involving 20 - 620 nm probes in aqueous 1MDa polyacrylic acid . Much early work on the relationship between D p and η referenced the pioneering study of Langevin and Rondelez 21 on sedimentation in polymer solutions . Langevin and Rondelez propose that small sedimenting particles experience the solvent viscosity , but adequately large sedimenting particles experience a much larger drag proportional to the macroscopic solution viscosity . The distinction between small and large particles is deter - mined by a ratio R / ξ , R bring the probe radius and ξ being a hypothesized characteristic correlation length 44 ” . . . dependent on concentration . . . but independent of the molecular weight M . ” Langevin and Rondelez cite un - published results of deGennes 180 as predicting for the sedimentation coeﬃcient s s s 0 = exp ( − AR δ c ν ) + η s / η . ( 23 ) Here A is a molecular - weight - independent constant and δ is a scaling exponent . ξ ∼ 1 / ( Ac ν ) is the distance be - tween the hypothesized entanglement points of the tran - sient statistical lattice seen in the deGennes model 181 for polymer solutions . For small particles , this form predicts s ≈ s 0 , while for large particles the exponential is domi - nated by η s / η , even for η s / η ≪ 1 , so that s is determined by the solution’s macroscopic viscosity . The Langevin - Rondelez equation 21 is a special case of general assertions that : polymer solutions have a longest distance scale ξ , properties measured over distances s ≫ ξ necessarily re - ﬂect macroscopic system properties , and therefore D p of large ( R ≫ ξ ) probes must follow the Stokes - Einstein equation . If this proposal were correct , the polyacrylic acid : water systems in which the Stokes - Einstein equation fails badly would be in this regime R (cid:11) ξ , implying a sur - prising ξ of hundreds of nanometers . Langevin and Rondelez report sedimentation experi - ments leading to ν ≈ 0 . 62 , δ ≈ 1 being consistent with limited measurements , and A ∼ M 0 in the limit of low probe concentration . Langevin and Rondelez do not treat diﬀusion explicitly . The same drag coeﬃcient determines s and D p , leading to D p / D p 0 ∼ s / s 0 , implying that eq . 23 should also govern probe diﬀusion . Bu and Russo 20 examine the diﬀusion of extremely small probes ( 0 . 5 - 55 nm ) in HPC : water . In one of the few published explicit tests of eq . 23 as applied to diﬀusion , Bu and Russo ﬁnd the dependence of D p / D p 0 on R to match Langevin and Rondelez’s prediction . Small probes diﬀuse much more rapidly that expected from η ; for larger probes η µ ap - proaches η . A result A ∼ M γ for γ 6 = 0 is entirely inconsistent with the physical model invoked by Langevin and Rondelez in their ansatz for their equation . However , in large num - bers of probe : polymer systems D p / D p 0 depends strongly on M . It is at present unclear whether the strong M - dependence of D p / D p 0 would disappear with suﬃciently small probes , in which case eq . 23 could be correct , or whether D p / D p 0 is determined by an equation similar to 23 but in which A depends on M . D . Concentration Dependence of D p As seen above , in almost but not quite every system whose relaxations can be characterized by a single diﬀu - sion coeﬃcient D p , the concentration dependence of D p is described by a stretched exponential in polymer concen - tration . The ﬁtting parameters α and ν of the stretched exponentials are found in Tables I - V . It is apparent that α varies over a substantial range , and that ν varies over a considerably narrower range . Whenever D p and c were varied over a suﬃcient range to support a credible log - log plot of D p against c ( e . g . , Figures 13b , 19 , 20 , and 37 ) , the apparent slope d log ( D p ) / d log ( c ) decreases monoton - ically with increasing c , precisely as expected for data that follow a stretched exponential in c . If D p followed a power law in c , a plot of log ( D p ) against log ( c ) would reveal a straight line . It is possi - ble on the aforementioned ﬁgures to draw straight lines tangent to the observed D p ( c ) curves , but such straight lines manifestly are simply local tangents . Furthermore , a log - log plot of a stretched exponential in c , no matter its parameters , always shows a smooth curve , while on the same plot a power - law is a straight line . Measurements that actually follow a power law in c therefore cannot be described accurately with a force - ﬁtted stretched expo - nential , and vice versa . Relationships between α , ν , and M for probes in an extensive series of homologous polymers were studied by Phillies , et al . 45 ( PSL in dextran : water ) and by Phillies , et al . 48 ( PSL in polystyrenesulfonate : water . ) Represen - tative results on these systems appear as Figures 25 and 28 , respectively . Figure 60 shows α and ν for probes in dextran : water 45 . Over the observed molecular weight range , α ∼ M 0 . 84 w . With increasing M , ν decreases from 1 . 0 to slightly more than 0 . 5 . The authors deter - mined the polymer molecular weight distributions using aqueous size - exclusion chromatography ; measured poly - dispersities M w / M n ranged from 1 . 16 to 2 . 17 . No eﬀect of polydispersity on probe diﬀusion was identiﬁed . These results show that α depends strongly on M , and serve to reject any suggestion that polymer dynamics are strongly sensitive to the detailed shape of the polymer molecular weight distribution , as opposed to being determined by averaged molecular weights . Phillies , et al . 48 sought to determine the initial slope of D p ( c ) for probes in a series of of homologous monodis - perse polymers . The intent was to test the Phillies - Kirkitelos 49 hydrodynamic calculation of α . Measure - ments were ﬁt to straight lines , simple exponentials , and stretched exponentials in c , which describe these data out to progressively larger c . The Phillies - Kirkitelos 49 calculation , which parallels hydrodynamic calculations of the concentration dependence of D s of hard spheres , has no free parameters . The predicted α depends on probe radius a p , chain thickness a c , and M . So long as a p ≫ a c , the calculated α is very nearly insensitive to a p and a c . As seen in Figure 61 , for M ≥ 38 kDa good agreement is found between the measurements and the no - free - parameter calculation . For M ≤ 20 kDa , the experimental α is too large , a deviation interpreted by Phillies , et al . 48 as appearing because short polystyrene sulfonate chains are not well - approximated as random coils . Accurate determination of α and ν from non - linear least squares ﬁts is challenging , because errors in these parameters are strongly anticorrelated . To determine α and ν accurately , one needs accurate measurements of 45 10000 100000 1000000 M ( Da ) 0 . 01 0 . 1 1 a 10000 100000 1000000 M ( Da ) 0 . 6 0 . 8 1 n FIG . 60 : Parameters α and ν from ﬁts of D p of 20 . 4 ( ◦ ) and 230 ( (cid:3) ) nm spheres in dextran solutions , and η of those solutions , to exp ( − αc ν ) , against dextran M w , showing α ∼ M 0 . 84 with ν decreasing from 1 . 0 toward 0 . 5 over the observed molecular weight range . D p ( c ) at quite small , not just large , concentrations , as well as over a wide range of D p ( c ) / D p ( 0 ) . Only a lim - ited number of studies seem to attain these conditions . Furthermore , the systematic review above reveals sys - tems with multimodal spectra , systems in which D p ( c ) exhibits re - entrant behavior , and some measurements on polyelectrolyte and rodlike polymer solutions , none of which appear exactly comparable to mesoscopic probes diﬀusing in solutions of near - random - coil neutral poly - mers . 1 10 100 1000 M w ( kDa ) 0 . 001 0 . 01 0 . 1 a FIG . 61 : α , the initial slope of D p ( c ) against M for 7 ( (cid:13) ) , 34 ( • ) , and 95 ( (cid:3) ) nm radius polystyrene spheres in aqueous polystyrene sulfonate : 0 . 2 M NaCl , and ( line ) the no - free - parameter prediction for α ( M ) in this system , after Phillies , et al . 48 . With these exclusions , Figures 62 exhibit α and ν as functions of M for probes in a range of polymer solu - tions . The solid line α ∼ M 0 . 84 is taken from Figure 65 , Ref . 60 ; it represents a best ﬁt to the measurements on dextran solutions . With few exceptions , α is seen to be closely correlated with the molecular weight of the matrix polymer over two orders of magnitude in its de - pendent and independent variables . From Figure 62 , one sees ν ≈ 1 at lower polymer molecular weight , and more scattered values at larger M . Probes in polyisobutylene are noteworthy for retaining ν ≈ 1 up to the largest M examined . The solid line in Figure 62 corresponds to the dependence of ν found for the not entirely physically dissimilar polymer self - diﬀusion coeﬃcient . As seen in Figure 65 of Ref . 12 , ν from D s is ≈ 1 . 0 at lower M , declining to 0 . 5 by M ≈ 500 kDa . α and ν are thus seen to be correlated with matrix molecular weight M , a cor - relation that will be predicted by a valid physical model for these parameters . A few systems show re - entrant behavior in which a relaxation rate increases rather than decreasing with in - creasing c . Most observations of reentrant behavior in - volve systems showing bimodal spectra . For example , Bremell 16 , 17 , and Dunstan and Stokes 29 report for low - ionic - strength solutions a slow probe mode that slows with increasing c and a fast probe mode whose relaxation rate ﬁrst increases and then decreases with increasing c . With the same polymer and elevated ( 0 . 1 , 1 . 0 M ) ionic strengths , the relaxation rates of both modes increase and perhaps plateau with increasing c . Ullmann , et al . do report a probe in polyethylene oxide : water whose sin - 46 1 10 100 1000 10000 M ( kDa ) 0 . 001 0 . 01 0 . 1 1 α 1 10 100 1000 10000 M ( kDa ) 0 . 1 1 0 . 2 0 . 4 0 . 6 0 . 8 2 n FIG . 62 : α and ν of exp ( − αc ν ) as functions of M , for meso - scopic probes in solutions of PMMA ( N ) 19 , dextran ( ◦ ) 30 ( • ) 45 , polyacrylic acid ( ♦ ) 39 , polystyrene ( △ ) 43 , polyisobuty - lene ( + ) , and bovine serum albumin ( ⋆ ) 58 ( plotted based on its hydrodynamic radius ) . The lines are α ∼ M 0 . 84 , based on probes in dextran : water 45 , and ν = ν ( M ) based on Fig . 65 of Ref . 12 . gle relaxation rate has a true maximum with increasing c . However , Ullmann , et al . ’s data were from an old - style linear correlator , so their spectra might have been bimodal , the second peak passing unseen . In a very few systems , an apparent low - c plateau is observed , in which D p is nearly constant over a range of low concentrations and then begins to fall above some low - concentration limiting c . Good examples of this be - havior are supplied by Yang and Jamieson 79 for probes in HPC : water , and by Papagiannapolis , et al . 119 ( who ﬁnd the plateau in η µ rather than D p ) . E . Particle Size Eﬀects The evidence above on the eﬀect of probe size reduces to two general statements with a qualiﬁcation . First , true gels , e . g . , polyacrylamide gels , protein gels , or cellular in - teriors , are indeed size ﬁlters , as witness the results of , e . g . , Luby - Phelps , et al . 142 , 143 . True gels are substan - tially more eﬀective at retarding the diﬀusion of larger probes than at retarding the diﬀusion of smaller probes . Second , to ﬁrst approximation polymer solutions are rel - atively weak size ﬁlters . As witness the results of Hou , et al . 141 , polymer solutions are only slightly more eﬀec - tive at retarding the diﬀusion of smaller probes that at retarding the diﬀusion of larger probes . However , the ap - proximation that polymer solutions are weak size ﬁlters breaks down for very small probes , as studied by Bu and Russo 20 . In a polymer solution , a very small probe may be considerably more mobile , relative to its size , than a large probe would be . It is legitimate to ask if rheology , and probe diﬀusion using suﬃciently large albeit mesoscopic probes , should measure the same viscosity . It is noteworthy that the few true microrheological measurements on forced motion of micron - scale probes indicate that true microrheology and classical rheology do not always measure the same quantities . In simple liquids 130 and in rigid - rod fd - virus solutions 132 , macroscopic and true microscopic measure - ments of viscosity are consistently in good agreement . On the other hand , in low - molecular - weight 85 kDa polyethy - lene oxide solutions , dynamic moduli measured with a 1 . 6 µ m probe are 128 ’quite diﬀerent from those obtained by a macroscopic rheometer’ . In F - actin solutions , true mi - crorheological moduli are substantially smaller than their macrorheological counterparts 130 , typically by factors of 2 - 8 . Only very limited true microrheological measure - ments exist for neutral random - coil polymers in good solvents , so generalization appears hazardous . Because microscopic and classical macroscopic rheological instru - ments sometimes give diﬀerent values for η , there is no reason to expect that η µ from D p will agree with η from a classical macroscopic instrument , rather than agreeing with the very diﬀerent η from a microscopic instrument . F . Comparison of Probe Diﬀusion and Polymer Self - Diﬀusion Phillies , Brown , and Zhou 182 re - examine results of Brown and collaborators 19 , 69 on probe diﬀusion by sil - ica spheres and tracer diﬀusion of polyisobutylene ( PIB ) chains through PIB : chloroform solutions . These com - parisons are the most precise available in the literature , in the sense that all measurements were made in the same laboratory using exactly the same matrix polymer 47 samples . Comparisons were made between silica sphere probes and polymer chains have very nearly equal D p and D t in the absence of PIB . For each probe sphere and probe chain , the concentration dependence of the single - particle diﬀusion coeﬃcient is accurately described by a stretched exponential in c . For large probes ( 160 nm sil - ica spheres , 4 . 9 MDa PIB ) in solutions of a small ( 610 kDa ) PIB , D p ( c ) / D t ( c ) remains very nearly independent of c as D p ( c ) falls 100 - fold from its dilute solution limit . In contrast , with small probes ( 32 nm silica spheres , 1 . 1 MDa PIB ) in solutions of a large polymer ( 4 . 9 MDa PIB ) , D p ( c ) / D t ( c ) depends very strongly on c . Between 0 and 6 g / L matrix PIB , D t falls nearly 300 - fold , while over the same concentration range D p falls no more than 10 - fold . D p was followed out to the considerably larger concen - tration at which it , too , had fallen 300 - hundred - fold from its small - matrix - concentration limit . This result is some - what surprising relative to some theories of polymer dy - namics , because in non - dilute polymer solutions polymer chains are predicted 181 to have available modes of mo - tion , such as reptation , that are predicted to be denied to rigid spheres . That is , in solutions of a very large ( 4 . 9 MDa ) poly - mer , at concentrations large enough that D p was reduced 300 - hundred - fold , the matrix polymer was far more eﬀec - tive at obstructing the motions of rigid probes than at obstructing the motion of long ﬂexible chains . One could propose that at still larger c the trend in D p ( c ) / D t ( c ) reverses with increasing c , but there is absolutely no sign of such a phenomenon in the published experiments . In the 4 . 9 MDa system , c [ η ] was only taken out to 2 or 6 , so it could reasonably be argued that the observed phenomenology only refers to non - dilute non - entangled systems , and that a diﬀerent phenomenology might be encountered in entangled polymer solutions . G . Systems Having Multimodal Spectra While multimodal probe spectra have been reported in several systems , only in hydroxypropylcellulose : wa - ter is there a highly systematic examination of the full range of experimental parameters . Because only one sys - tem showing multimodal spectra has been studied sys - tematically , one cannot be certain to what extent one is examining speciﬁc chemical eﬀects rather than a general phenomenology . A few speciﬁc points seem most worth repeating : Probe and probe - free HPC solution spectra are both bimodal or trimodal , with modes on the same time scales . However , the probe and polymer modes are not the same : The concentration dependences of a probe mode and the corresponding polymer mode can be op - posite in sign . A wide range of phenomena indicate that these so - lutions have a dominant characteristic length scale ξ , ξ being approximately the size of a polymer chain , and not some shorter distance . In particular , while small and large probes both show bimodal spectra , probes having R < ξ and R > ξ show very diﬀerent concentration de - pendences for their spectral parameters . The observed characteristic length ξ is approximately 2 R g , the diame - ter of a random chain coil . ξ depends weakly or not at all on polymer concentration . In contrast , the hypothe - sized characteristic length scale between chain entangle - ments is a distance , smaller than a polymer chain , that depends strongly on polymer concentration . Taken to - gether these results serve to reject interpretations of the viscoelastic solutionlike : meltlike transition in this system as representing a transition to reptation dynamics . How - ever , it is not certain if chain dynamics in HPC : water are representative of generic polymer dynamics , or if special chemical eﬀects unique to HPC are important , so it ap - pears premature to generalize these interpretations to all polymer solutions . V . SUMMARY The experimental literature on the motion of meso - scopic probe particles through polymer solutions is sys - tematically reviewed . The primary focus is the study of diﬀusive motion of small probe particles . Compar - ison is made with literature data on solution viscosi - ties . A coherent description was obtained , namely that the probe diﬀusion coeﬃcient generally depends on poly - mer concentration as D p = D p 0 exp ( − αc ν ) . One ﬁnds that the scaling prefactor α depends on polymer molec - ular weights as α ∼ M 0 . 8 . The scaling exponent ν appears to have large - M and small - M values with a crossover linking them . The probe diﬀusion coeﬃcient does not simply track the solution viscosity ; instead , D p η typically increases markedly with increasing poly - mer concentration and molecular weight . In some sys - tems , e . g . , hydroxypropylcellulose : water , the observed probe spectra are bi - or tri - modal . Extended analysis of the full probe phenomenology implies that hydrox - ypropylcellulose solutions are characterized by a single , concentration - independent , length scale that is approxi - mately the size of a polymer coil . In a very few systems , one sees re - entrant or low - concentration - plateau behav - iors of uncertain interpretation . From their rarity , these behaviors are reasonably interpreted as corresponding to speciﬁc chemical eﬀects . True microrheological studies examining the motion of mesoscopic particles under the inﬂuence of a known external force are also examined . The viscosity determined with a true microrheological measurement is in many cases substantially smaller than the viscosity measured with a macroscopic instrument . ∗ To whom inquiries should be sent phillies @ wpi . edu 1 D .
