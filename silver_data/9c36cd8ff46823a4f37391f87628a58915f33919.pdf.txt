Results : A novel vesiculation assay was used to demonstrate a role for endocytic regulatory proteins in vesiculation . Conclusion : EHD family proteins play significant roles in both the vesiculation and generation of tubular recycling endosomes . Significance : This provides the first direct evidence of differential EHD function in vesiculation and tubulation . Endocytic recycling involves the return of membranes and receptors to the plasma membrane following their internaliza - tion into the cell . Recycling generally occurs from a series of vesicular and tubular membranes localized to the perinuclear region , collectively known as the endocytic recycling compart - ment . Within this compartment , receptors are sorted into tubu - lar extensions that later undergo vesiculation , allowing trans - port vesicles to move along microtubules and return to the cell surface where they ultimately undergo fusion with the plasma membrane . Recent studies have led to the hypothesis that the C - terminal Eps15 homology domain ( EHD ) ATPase proteins are involved in the vesiculation process . Here , we address the functional roles of the four EHD proteins . We developed a novel semipermeabilized cell system in which addition of purified EHD proteins to reconstitute vesiculation allows us to assess the ability of each protein to vesiculate MICAL - L1 - decorated tubu - lar recycling endosomes ( TREs ) . Using this assay , we show that EHD1 vesiculates membranes , consistent with enhanced TRE generation observed upon EHD1 depletion . EHD4 serves a role similar to that of EHD1 in TRE vesiculation , whereas EHD2 , despite being capable of vesiculating TREs in the semiperme - abilized cells , fails to do so in vivo . Surprisingly , the addition of EHD3 causes tubulation of endocytic membranes in our semipermeabilized cell system , consistent with the lack of tubulation observed upon EHD3 depletion . Our novel vesic - ulation assay and in vitro electron microscopy analysis , com - bined with in vivo data , provide evidence that the functions of both EHD1 and EHD4 are primarily in TRE membrane vesic - ulation , whereas EHD3 is a membrane - tubulating protein . Endocytic recycling is the process of returning membranes and receptors to the plasma membrane following their inter - nalization into the cell . Regulated recycling generally occurs from a series of vesicular and tubular membranes localized to the perinuclear region , collectively known as the endocytic recycling compartment ( 1 ) . Current models hold that the gen - eration of tubular membranes that extend from this subcellular region facilitate the sorting and trafficking of cargo ( 2 ) . After sorting , vesiculation takes place , and vesicles containing lipids and receptors are transported along microtubules and returned to the cell surface where they ultimately undergo fusion with the plasma membrane . Recycling is a tightly regulated event , controlled by a variety of proteins that include small GTPases , their effectors , motor proteins , microtubules , SNARE proteins , and the C - terminal Eps15 homology domain ( EHD ) 3 ATPase protein , EHD1 . Indeed , EHD1 and its three mammalian orthologs have all been implicated in regulating various endocytic transport events . EHD1 regulates the exit of proteins from the endocytic recy - cling compartment to the plasma membrane , whereas EHD3 and EHD4 play roles in transport at the early / sorting endo - somes ( 3 ) . EHD2 is involved in the control of caveolar struc - tures underneath the plasma membrane ( 4 – 6 ) . There have been conflicting reports on the mechanistic roles of EHD proteins . Based on their structure and in vitro studies , EHD proteins can induce membrane bending and tubulation ( 7 , 8 ) . However , a recent study indicates that the EHD1 - inter - action partners , MICAL - L1 and particularly the F - BAR - do - main - containing protein , Syndapin2 , are essential proteins responsible for tubule biogenesis in vivo ( 9 ) . Studies support a major role for EHD1 in membrane vesiculation rather than tubulation ( 10 , 11 ) . However , due to the availability of limited * Thisworkwassupported , inwholeorinpart , byNationalInstitutesofHealth Grants R01GM087455 ( to S . C . and P . L . S . ) , R01GM074876 ( to S .

We now address the physiological roles of all four EHD pro - teins . Because the existing vesiculation assays are based on in vitro systems and / or complex biophysical measurements ( 12 – 14 ) , we have developed a novel semipermeabilized cell system using purified proteins to assess the ability of each of the pro - teins to vesiculate MICAL - L1 - decorated tubular recycling endosomes ( TREs ) . Using this assay along with an in vitro vesic - ulation assay , we show that EHD1 vesiculates membranes , a role consistent with the enhanced TRE networks observed upon EHD1 depletion . Experiments with EHD4 indicate that this protein plays a role similar to that of EHD1 . EHD2 , despite being capable of vesiculating TREs in the semipermeabilized cell system , does not induce vesiculation in vivo . Surprisingly , EHD3 , the closest paralog to EHD1 , plays a role in membrane tubulation , as observed both in our semipermeabilized cell sys - tem and in vivo , and fails to vesiculate membranes in vitro . Our data provide evidence that both EHD1 and EHD4 function pri - marily in TRE membrane vesiculation , whereas EHD3 is a membrane - tubulating protein . EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES Gene Knockdown by Silencing RNA ( siRNA ) —Oligonucleo - tide duplexes targeting EHD1 ( 15 ) , EHD3 ( 16 ) , and ON - TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA targeting EHD2 and EHD4 ( Dharmacon ) were transfected into HeLa cells for 72 h using Oligofectamine ( Invitrogen ) as described previously ( 11 ) . Antibodies and Reagents —Polyclonal rabbit anti - EHD1 , - EHD2 , - EHD3 , and - EHD4 peptide antibodies were described previously ( 17 ) . Mouse anti - CD59 antibody was kindly pro - vided by Dr . V . Horejsi and described ( 11 , 18 ) . Commercial anti - bodies and reagents used in this study : mouse anti - MICAL - L1 and mouse anti - actin ( Novus Biologicals ) , rat anti - HSP70 ( Stressgen ) , rabbit anti - Syndapin2 ( Abgent ) , mouse anti - GAPDH ( Protein Tech ) , goat anti - mouse HRP and goat anti - rat HRP ( Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories , Inc . ) , and donkey anti - rabbit HRP ( GE Healthcare ) . Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti - mouse , and Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti - rabbit were pur - chased from Invitrogen . Digitonin , ATP , creatine phosphate , and creatine phosphokinase were from Sigma . Immunofluorescence and Uptake Assays —HeLa cells were grown on coverslips , transfected with EHD - siRNAs , and fixed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( v / v ) . Immunostaining was done with anti - MICAL - L1 or anti - Syndapin2 antibodies , followed by appropriate fluorochrome - conjugated secondary antibodies . CD59 and 568 - transferrin uptake was performed as described ( 11 ) . Images were obtained using an LSM5 Pascal confocal microscope ( Carl Zeiss ) with a 63 (cid:2) 1 . 4 numerical aperture objective . Constructs , Protein Purification , and Circular Dichroism — GST - EH1 was cloned and purified as described previously ( 9 ) . Pcold - GST was a generous gift from Chojiro Kojima ( Osaka , Japan ) , and all four EHD proteins were cloned into this vector . Pcold - GST - EHDs were purified as described ( 19 ) , and the puri - fied proteins underwent circular dichroism studies as described previously ( 9 ) . Semipermeabilized Cell System Vesiculation Assay —This assay was modified from the methods described by the Balch ( 20 ) and Aridor ( 21 ) laboratories . HeLa cells were grown on coverslips and at 80 – 90 % confluence , and cytosol was extracted with 20 (cid:2) g / ml digitonin for 40 s at room temperature . After three washes in KHM buffer containing 110 m M KOAc , 20 m M HEPES ( pH 7 . 2 ) , and 2 m M MgOAc , semipermeabilized cells were incubated with GST proteins in the presence of 25 m M HEPES , 115 m M KCl , 2 . 5 m M MgCl 2 , 1 m M ATP , 5 m M creatine phosphate and 0 . 2 IU of creatine phosphokinase for 30 min at 37 °C . Cells were then washed three times in KHM buffer , fixed , and stained with anti - MICAL - L1 antibody . Quantification of MICAL - L1 Tubules by ImageJ —Using ImageJ software , the image background was reduced by adjust - ing the threshold . The particle size was set between 2 (cid:2) m 2 and 150 (cid:2) m 2 . All MICAL - L1 - containing particles in this range were counted . Ten fields of images from each treatment were analyzed . Liposome Preparation —Liposomes were prepared by mixing PC ( 1 , 2 - dioleoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphocholine ) , PS ( 1 , 2 , - dio - leoyl - sn - glycero - 3 - phosphoserine ) , and PI ( 4 , 5 ) P 2 ( phosphati - dylinositol 4 , 5 - bisphosphate ) at an 80 / 10 / 10 molar ratio or 100 % PC and dried under nitrogen . Lipids were suspended in blocking buffer ( 176 m M HEPES , 100 m M NaCl , 1 m M EGTA , 1 m M DTT ( pH 7 ) ) and subjected to five freeze / thaw cycles on dry ice followed by 1 - min sonication at 21 °C . Lipids were then passed through a mini - extruder with 0 . 4 - (cid:2) m pore filters . Lipids and supplies were from Avanti Polar Lipids . Liposome Vesiculation Assays and Electron Microscopy — 100 - (cid:2) l reactions were mixed with 25 (cid:2) g / ml liposomes , 2 . 5 (cid:2) M total protein , and 1 m M ATP (cid:1) S and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min . Two 300 - mesh copper EM grids coated with formvar and carbon ( EMS ) were incubated for 15 min with half of the reac - tion mixture and negatively stained with 2 % phosphotungstic acid ( aq ) three times for 4 s . Samples were visualized using a JEM 1011 transmission electron microscope ( JEOL ) operated at 100 kV . Images were captured by ORIUS 835 . 10W CCD camera ( Gatan , Inc . ) . RESULTS To address the roles of the four human EHD proteins in vivo on TREs , we first used siRNA to knock down their expression . As depicted in Fig . 1 , we successfully depleted EHD1 ( Fig . 1 A ) , EHD2 ( Fig . 1 B ) , EHD3 ( Fig . 1 C ) , and EHD4 ( Fig . 1 D ) from cells . MICAL - L1 protein levels remained unaffected upon EHD depletions , except in EHD3 - depleted cells where a consistent decrease in expression was observed ( Fig . 1 C ) . Under these conditions , EHD1 depletion caused an increase in the overall elaborateness , total number , and the total area of MICAL - L1 - decorated TREs compared with mock - treated cells ( compare Fig . 1 , F with E ) . Quantification of total tubule num - ber and total MICAL - L1 - containing tubular area was calcu - lated using ImageJ software ( example shown in Fig . 2 , A – C ) and applied to cells depleted of each EHD protein ( quantified in Fig . 2 , D and E ) . EHD2 depletion had little effect on TREs ( compare Fig . 1 , G and E ; see Fig . 2 , D and E , for quantification ) . Surpris - ingly , EHD3 depletion greatly reduced the number and area of TREs ( Fig . 1 H ; see Fig . 2 , D and E , for quantification ) .

Similar results were observed for an additional TRE marker protein , Syndapin2 ( Ref . 9 and Fig . 1 , J – N ) . These data support the notion that both EHD1 and EHD4 are involved in the vesiculation of TREs in vivo , whereas EHD3 tubulates recycling endosomes . We next tested whether an actual cargo protein that is trans - ported along TREs , CD59 ( 18 ) , is similarly affected . In mock - treated cells , internalized CD59 partially localized to TREs ( Fig . 1 O ) . However , EHD1 depletion induced a dramatic increase in the localization of CD59 to TREs ( Fig . 1 P ) . Similar to our results assessing MICAL - L1 - decorated TREs , this increase was mir - rored by EHD4 depletion ( Fig . 1 S ) . Again , EHD2 depletion had little impact on CD59 localization ( Fig . 1 O ) , whereas EHD3 depletion , consistent with its effect on MICAL - L1 - containing TREs , enhanced vesiculation ( Fig . 1 R ) . We reasoned that if EHD1 depletion indeed led to an enhancement in TREs , then the re - expression of exogenous EHD1 in depleted cells should lead to vesiculation and reduced TREs . As shown in Fig . 3 , A and B , upon depletion of EHD1 , cells transfected with a siRNA - resistant EHD1 plasmid ( Res - GFP - Myc - EHD1 ; cells within orange boundary ) displayed decreased levels of TRE content compared with nontransfected cells . Similar results were observed for EHD4 ( Fig . 3 , E and F ; see cells within orange boundary ) . On the other hand , when a siRNA - resistant EHD3 plasmid was introduced into EHD3 - de - FIGURE 1 .

EHD Proteins as Vesiculators and Tubulators OCTOBER 18 , 2013• VOLUME 288•NUMBER 42 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 30175 by gu e s t on N ov e m b e r 19 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m pleted cells ( where no TREs were observed ) , this induced TRE tubulation ( Fig . 3 , C and D ; see cells within orange boundary ) . To address definitely the function of the four individual EHD proteins in TRE vesiculation , we first purified GST fusion pro - teins for all four EHDs and the inactive EHD1 - G65R mutant and EH domain only of EHD1 ( EH1 ) ( Fig . 4 A ) . Circular dichr - oism was used to confirm the folding and secondary structure of the purified proteins ( Fig . 4 B ) . We then developed a novel semipermeabilized cell system to measure vesiculation . We extracted cytosolic proteins and proteins that were not tightly associated with TRE or the cytoskeleton from live cells . Increas - ing concentrations of digitonin led to the extraction of EHD1 , EHD3 , EHD4 , and GAPDH ( positive control ) with a modest impact on actin levels ( Fig . 5 A ) . EHD2 was also partially extracted , but remained more resistant than the other EHD proteins , consistent with its association with caveolae ( 4 – 6 , 22 ) . Only a modest decrease was noted in the level of MICAL - L1 , likely due to its tight association with phosphatidic acid on TRE ( 9 ) . Semipermeabilized cells on coverslips were incubated with GST ( Fig . 5 B , negative control ) , GST bound to the EH1 ( Fig . 5 G , GST - EH1 , negative control ) , the GST - EHD1 G65R ATP - bind - ing mutant ( Fig . 5 H , negative control ) , GST - EHD1 ( Fig . 5 C ) , GST - EHD2 ( Fig . 5 D ) , GST - EHD3 ( Fig . 5 E ) , or GST - EHD4 ( Fig . 5 F ) . Little change was observed in TREs with the addition of GST - EH1 ( Fig . 5 G ) compared with GST alone ( Fig . 5 B ) . GST - EHD1 G65R showed a modest reduction in TREs , likely due to residual EHD1 activity ( Fig . 5 H ) . On the other hand , addition of purified wild - type EHD1 caused a significant reduction in the number and total area of TREs , indicating that EHD1 serves as a TRE vesiculator ( Fig . 5 C and quantified in I and J ) . Similarly , EHD2 was capable of vesiculation ( Fig . 5 D and quantified in I and J ) . On the other hand , the addition of EHD3 to semiperme - abilized cells induced TRE formation , reinforcing the idea that unlike EHD1 , EHD3 plays a role in the generation of tubules ( Fig . 5 E and quantified in I and J ) . Finally , the addition of EHD4 also induced vesiculation of TREs , similar to EHD1 , and similar to the role observed for EHD4 and EHD1 in vivo ( Fig . 5 F and quantified in I and J ) . To further characterize the distinct roles for EHD proteins in membrane modeling using our semipermeabilized cell system , we measured the number of MICAL - L1 - containing TREs per field ( Fig . 6 A ) and the total area of MICAL - L1 - containing TREs per field ( Fig . 6 B ) with increasing concentrations of EHD pro - teins . As demonstrated , whereas the addition of GST alone had no impact on MICAL - L1 - containing TREs , both EHD1 and EHD4 induced vesiculation in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 6 , A and B ) . On the other hand , EHD3 increased tubulation in a dose - dependent manner ( Fig . 6 , A and B ) , further highlighting the functional differences between these proteins . Given the surprising differences in their effects on mem - branes both in vivo and in our semipermeabilized cell system , FIGURE3 . RescueexperimentsforEHDdepletions .

As demonstrated in the repre - sentative micrographs , addition of EHD1 to PC / PS / PIP 2 lipo - somes in the presence of ATP induced membrane vesiculation ( Fig . 7 B ) , whereas liposomes remained unaffected by the addi - tion of EHD1 without ATP ( Fig . 7 A ) . Incubation of liposomes in the presence of EHD1 and the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog , ATP (cid:1) S , induced vesiculation similar to that seen with ATP , suggesting that under these specific in vitro conditions , ATP binding ( but not hydrolysis ) is sufficient for vesiculation . Indeed , incubation of liposomes in the presence of ATP and EHD1 G65R ( a mutant predicted to have defective ATP bind - ing ) displayed impaired vesiculation compared with wild - type EHD1 ( Fig . 7 D ) . Quantification of these data demonstrated that the mean liposome diameter was (cid:3) 280 nm , and this decreased to (cid:3) 150 nm in the presence of either EHD1 and ATP or EHD1 and ATP (cid:1) S ( Fig . 8 A ) . On the other hand , incubation of the EHD1 G65R mutant and ATP with liposomes had little effect on the mean liposome diameter ( (cid:3) 250 nm ; Fig . 8 A ) . In the same experiments , addition of EHD3 ( in the absence or presence of ATP ; Fig . 7 , E and F , quantified in Fig . 8 B ) did not lead to the vesiculation of PC / PS / PIP 2 liposomes . Quantifica - tion also demonstrated that incubation of EHD1 with the lipo - somes caused a dramatic shift in the distribution of vesicle size , with (cid:3) 50 % of the vesicles found in the 51 – 100 - nm range ( com - pared with (cid:4) 5 % for EHD3 or BSA ; Fig . 8 C ) . Overall , our results strongly support a role for EHD1 ( and EHD4 ) in TRE vesicula - tion , whereas EHD3 is likely involved in the tubulation process . FIGURE 5 .

EHD Proteins as Vesiculators and Tubulators OCTOBER 18 , 2013• VOLUME 288•NUMBER 42 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY 30177 by gu e s t on N ov e m b e r 19 , 2017 h tt p : / / www . j b c . o r g / D o w n l o a d e d fr o m DISCUSSION C - terminal EHD ATPase proteins play major roles in the regulation of endocytic trafficking . The crystallization of mouse EHD2 ( 8 ) and the identification of EHD proteins as ATPases ( 8 , 17 , 23 ) have led to predictions that EHDs act as “pinchases” that constrict and / or vesiculate membranes ( Ref . 8 ; for review see Ref . 3 ) . Experimental evidence also supports a role for EHD proteins in membrane scission ( 10 , 11 ) . However , there is also convincing evidence from in vitro tubulation assays that EHD proteins are capable of bending and tubulating membranes ( 7 , 8 ) . To clarify the functions of the four EHD proteins , we com - pared their roles in vivo using a series of knockdowns and devel - oped a novel semipermeabilized cell system to test vesiculation using purified proteins . In vivo , EHD1 depletion caused a more elaborate TRE pattern for the scaffold MICAL - L1 , its interac - tion partner Syndapin2 , and the internalized cargo molecule CD59 . These data are entirely consistent with the vesiculation of MICAL - L1 - containing TREs when purified EHD1 was added to our semipermeabilized cell system , implicating EHD1 as a vesiculator of TREs . In vitro studies with EHD1 further sup - ported its role in vesiculation , and PC / PS / PIP2 liposomes dis - played a dramatic decrease in size from (cid:3) 250 nm to (cid:3) 150 nm when incubated with EHD1 , with (cid:3) 50 % of the vesicles in the 51 – 100 - nm range ( as opposed to (cid:4) 5 % for BSA control ) . Whereas a similar role was observed for EHD4 both in vivo and with semipermeabilized cells , the role of EHD2 was more diffi - cult to interpret . In vivo , depletion of EHD2 had little or no effect on TREs , consistent with its association with caveolae ( 4 – 6 , 22 ) . However , in the semipermeabilized cell system , EHD2 did induce vesiculation . We rationalize that in the latter system , purified EHD2 may be more promiscuous in its local - ization , and a partial association with TREs ( as well as the plasma membrane ) may allow it to vesiculate TRE membranes to which it normally does not localize . Remarkably , despite 86 % identity with EHD1 , EHD3 func - tions differently than EHD1 . EHD3 depletion led to massive vesiculation of MICAL - L1 - , Syndapin2 - , and CD59 - containing TREs . Consistent with the in vivo data , addition of EHD3 in our semipermeabilized cell system led to greatly enhanced tubula - tion , pointing to a role for this EHD protein in membrane tubu - lation . Moreover , in vitro assays showed that EHD3 did not mediate vesiculation . How do we reconcile the differences in EHD1 and EHD3 function ? One possibility is based on recent studies on BAR domain - containing proteins , suggesting that membrane tubu - lation is effectively an intermediate step in the process of vesic - ulation . Indeed , modeling by Ayton et al . on N - BAR proteins , and studies by Peter et al . on the N - BAR protein amphiphysin suggest that at intermediate concentrations , N - BARs affect tubule formation , whereas at high concentrations vesiculation of membranes is induced ( 24 , 25 ) . However , because our in vitro studies with controlled concentrations of purified pro - FIGURE 6 .

For example , several of the helices have amino acid changes that might alter the “width” of the membrane - binding scissors , potentially influencing the degree of membrane bending and perhaps dictating tubulation versus vesiculation . One such example is at the start of (cid:3) helix 12 ; in EHD1 and EHD4 residue 376 is a proline , whereas in EHD3 this residue is a serine . How - ever , clarifying the precise mechanism will require a concerted and detailed structural analysis . Our data clarify the roles of EHD1 and EHD4 as TRE vesicu - lators . Our findings are also consistent with a function for EHD3 in tubulation rather than vesiculation . Given our recent identification of Syndapin2 as an essential F - BAR protein that tubulates recycling endosomes ( 9 ) and its known interaction with all four EHD proteins including EHD3 ( 26 ) , additional studies will be needed to address the potential synergy of these proteins in TRE generation . Although we speculate that differ - ential interaction partners may also contribute to the functional differences between EHD1 and EHD3 , discerning the precise mechanism will await further studies .
