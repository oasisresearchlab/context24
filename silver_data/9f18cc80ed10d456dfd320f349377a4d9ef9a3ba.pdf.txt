Introduction Cell migration is a dynamic process that involves the coordina - tion of multiple cellular events , which include the disassembly of focal adhesions at the trailing edges and the assembly of new focal adhesions at the migrating fronts ( Lauffenburger and Horwitz , 1996 ; Caswell et al . , 2009 ) . Constitutive integrin turn - over , internalization , and recycling have been demonstrated under basal cell migration conditions ( Pellinen and Ivaska , 2006 ; Mosesson et al . , 2008 ) . In recent years , clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis has been shown to play a pivotal role in the internaliza - tion of surface integrins at focal adhesions that are undergoing basal turnover ( Chao and Kunz , 2009 ; Ezratty et al . , 2009 ) . However , few studies have examined dynamic integrin dis - assembly , redistribution , and reassembly in highly motile cells ( Webb et al . , 2002 ) . In fact , in vivo cell migration is often signifi - cantly increased by growth factor up - regulation under physio - logical and pathological conditions , such as inflammation , wound healing ( Ross et al . , 1986 ) , and cancer ( Price et al . , 1999 ) . It is unknown whether the mechanisms of integrin redistribution from the trailing edge to the migrating front are the same as in basal cell migration . Unexpectedly , we found that growth factor – stimulated cell migration is achieved by using a special circular dorsal ruffle ( CDR ) macropinocytosis mechanism that recruits , inter - nalizes , and recycles integrins . CDRs are massive actin cyto - skeletal remodeling structures that form within minutes at the dorsal cell surface after stimulation by growth factors , such as PDGF , EGF , and VEGF , in various cell types ( Chinkers et al . , 1979 ; Mellström et al . , 1988 ; Wu et al . , 2003 ; Orth and McNiven , 2006 ) . Although the function of these structures is largely un - known , they have been suggested to be part of an initial step leading to massive macropinocytosis ( Orth et al . , 2006 ) . Here , we delineate the pathway by which focal adhesions rapidly disassemble as integrins translocate to CDRs , are internalized by macropinocytosis , and then distribute to newly forming focal adhesions at the leading edge of cells during stimulated cell migration . This pathway was found to be entirely distinct from the clathrin - dependent or caveolin - dependent constitu - tive pathway of integrin turnover at focal adhesions in basal cell migration . D uring cell migration , integrins are redistributed from focal adhesions undergoing disassembly at the cell’s trailing edges to new focal adhesions assembling at leading edges . The initial step of integrin redistribution is thought to require clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis . However , whether clathrin - mediated endocytosis functions in different contexts , such as basal versus stimu - lated migration , has not been determined . In this paper , we examine the spatial and temporal redistribution of integrins from focal adhesions upon stimulation by growth factors . Four - dimensional confocal live - cell imaging along with functional analysis reveals that surface integrins do not undergo significant endocytosis at ventral focal adhe - sions upon cell stimulation with the platelet - derived growth factor . Rather , they abruptly redistribute to dorsal circular ruffles , where they are internalized through macropino - cytosis . The internalized integrins then transit through re - cycling endosomal compartments to repopulate newly formed focal adhesions on the ventral surface . These find - ings explain why integrins have long been observed to re - distribute through both surface - based and internal routes and identify a new function for macropinocytosis during growth factor – induced cell migration .

As a control , in unstimulated cells , we de - tected neither such rapid integrin  3 – GFP focal adhesion dis - assembly nor CDR formation ( Video 3 ) . Focal adhesion lifetime quantification showed that PDGF stimulation signifi - cantly accelerated focal adhesion disassembly ( Fig . 1 F ) . We also observed no obvious protein degradation of integrin  3 upon PDGF stimulation ( Fig . 1 G ) . These data suggest that stimulation by PDGF resulted in the redistribution of cell sur - face integrin  3 to CDRs followed by their internalization into macropinosomes . Integrin macropinocytosis occurs at CDRs followed by integrin recycling back to the ventral cell surface to form new focal adhesions Macropinosomes form as internal spherical structures that can be characterized by their ingestion of extracellular fluid , recruitment of EEA1 , and loss of F - actin during maturation ( Swanson , 2008 ; Kerr and Teasdale , 2009 ) . To confirm that surface integrin  3 was internalized through macropino - somes , we incubated cells in medium containing fluorescent dextran . After a 5 - min PDGF stimulation , we observed integrin  3 in structures that appeared circular and contained EEA1 and F - actin but not dextran ( Fig . 2 , A and B , top ) . Such charac - teristics were consistent with CDRs , which are open cell sur - face structures that do not retain fluid . However , after 10 min , we detected integrin  3 in structures that contained both dextran and EEA1 ( Fig . 2 A , bottom ) but had lost F - actin ( Fig . 2 B , bottom ) . Such characteristics were consistent with macropinosomes , which are closed internal structures that do retain fluid . Live imaging further revealed that , after macropinocytosis , cells started to migrate , and focal adhesions that contained inte - grin  3 – GFP reappeared at the migrating front ( Fig . 1 D , t = 21 min , z = 0 µm ; and Video 2 ) . These observations suggested that integrin  3 internalized by macropinocytosis at the dorsal sur - face was recycled through endosomal compartments for re - appearance in new focal adhesions on the ventral surface . To confirm this , we quantified the change in total cell surface inte - grin  3 protein amount by flow cytometry . 15 - min PDGF stimulation shifted the fluorescence intensity curve of surface integrin  3 to the left ( Fig . 2 C , blue curve , compared with the orange curve of no stimulation ) , whereas after 60 - min PDGF stimulation , the curve shifted back almost to the same position as no stimulation ( Fig . 2 C , red curve ) . Quantification showed that the total surface integrin  3 mean fluorescence intensity ( MFI ) in the whole cell population dropped 13 % after PDGF stimulation . Considering that different cells start CDR forma - tion and subsequent macropinocytosis internalization at various times after PDGF stimulation ( Fig . 1 C ) , the flow cytometric detection of a 13 % drop in total cell surface integrin  3 MFI at one time point for the whole cell population represents a large amount of cell surface integrin  3 internalization in those cells undergoing macropinocytosis . Next , we tracked surface integrin by an antibody - binding , acid - stripping endocytosis and recycling assay . Live cells were Results and discussion Growth factor stimulation induces integrin focal adhesion disassembly at the ventral cell surface and massive CDR formation with the accumulation of integrins at the dorsal cell surface Stimulation of fibroblasts by PDGF is a model system to study stimulated cell migration ( Ballestrem et al . , 2001 ; Roberts et al . , 2001 ) . Examining integrin  3 in these cells , we detected that integrins concentrate at focal adhesions ( Fig . 1 A ) . Remark - ably , after the addition of PDGF for 5 min , the integrins accu - mulated at actin - rich circular structures ( Fig . 1 A ) . According to our previous findings in PDGF - stimulated actin cytoskele - ton remodeling ( Gu et al . , 2007 ) , such actin - enriched circular structures are CDRs . Comparing the distribution of integrin  3 with two markers of CDRs , F - actin and cortactin ( Buccione et al . , 2004 ) , we found that all three molecules showed co - localization . 3D analysis showed integrin  3 , F - actin , and cor - tactin concentrating at cup - shaped structures that were raised upward from the dorsal cell surface ( Fig . 1 B , Fig . S1 A , and Video 1 ) . As a control , actin - independent membrane protein major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) class I did not trans - locate to CDRs under the same conditions ( Fig . S1 B ) . Kinetic quantification showed that 33 , 41 , 25 , 15 , 11 , and 5 % of cells had integrin  3 at CDRs at 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , and 30 min after PDGF stimulation , respectively ( Fig . 1 C ) . This temporal profile was concordant with previous lifetime studies on CDRs ( Buccione et al . , 2004 ; Orth et al . , 2006 ) . Besides integrin  3 , we also observed that integrin  1 redistributes to CDRs ( Fig . S1 C ) . After surface integrin  1 antibody labeling in live cells , we confirmed surface integrin  1 translocation to CDRs within as short as 3 min after PDGF stimulation ( Fig . S1 D ) . Such fast and massive surface integrin redistribution suggests that surface integrins follow a direct cell surface route rather than the slow surface – cytosol – surface endocytosis and re - cycling route . CDRs have also been observed in EGF - stimulated epithe - lial cells ( Chinkers et al . , 1979 ; Connolly et al . , 1984 ) and VEGF - stimulated endothelial cells ( Wu et al . , 2003 ) . Thus , we examined EGF - stimulated MDA - MB - 231 cells and VEGF - stimulated HUV - EC - C cells . We found that integrin  1 also redistrib - uted to CDRs in these cells ( Fig . S1 , E and F ) . We used 4D analysis that involved time - lapse confocal live - cell imaging experiments on NIH3T3 cells stably express - ing integrin  3 – GFP . Before PDGF stimulation , this integrin was observed at ventral focal adhesions ( Fig . 1 D , t = 0 min , z = 0 µm , arrows ; and Video 2 ) . Upon PDGF stimulation , integrin  3 – GFP redistributed to CDRs on the dorsal surface ( Fig . 1 D , t = 7 min , z = 3 . 2 µm , arrowhead ; and Video 2 ) . After CDR formation , the progenitor cup condensed and sank below the cell surface to become macropinosomes ( Fig . 1 D , t = 10 min , z = 1 . 6 µm and t = 12 min , z = 0 . 8 µm ; and Video 2 ) . The strongest GFP fluorescence signals moved from z = 3 . 2 µm down to z = 1 . 6 µm and then down to z = 0 . 8 µm , where the cytoplasm mostly resided . We quantified the num - ber of focal adhesions , the diameter of CDRs / macropinosomes , 63 Integrins traffic rapidly via macropinocytosis • Gu et al . Figure 1 .

JCB • VOLUME 193 • NUMBER 1 • 2011 64 Growth factor – induced integrin macropinocytosis is brefeldin A – ADP - ribosylated substrate ( BARS ) dependent but clathrin and caveolin - 1 ( CAV1 ) independent Next , we sought to compare the relative importance of clathrin - and CAV1 - mediated endocytosis versus macropinocytosis in the PDGF - stimulated integrin internalization . Because BARS is critical for the fission stage of macropinocytosis ( Liberali et al . , 2008 ; Haga et al . , 2009 ) , but not for clathrin - mediated endo - cytosis ( Bonazzi et al . , 2005 ; Kaksonen et al . , 2006 ) , we examined the effect of targeting BARS . We confirmed that after targeting BARS with siRNA , BARS protein levels dropped to < 5 % of control ( Fig . 4 A ) . BARS down - regulation did not block CDR formation ( Fig . 4 B ) . However , BARS down - regulation significantly reduced the num - ber of cells forming integrin  3 macropinosomes ( Fig . 4 C ) . Con - sistent with this , flow cytometry analysis showed that BARS down - regulation failed to reduce the amount of integrin  3 on the cell surface after PDGF stimulation ( Fig . 4 , D and E ) . BARS down - regulation also blocked integrin  3 macropinosome for - mation and subsequent integrin recycling in the endocytosis and recycling assay ( Fig . 4 F and Fig . S2 F ) . Next , we cotransfected BARS siRNA and fluorescence - tagged control siRNA as a way to select cells that had down - regulated BARS in live - cell imaging experiments ( Fig . S2 A ) . 4D live imaging showed that these cells were still able to form CDRs after PDGF stimulation incubated with a nonblocking anti – integrin  3 antibody to label surface integrin  3 . After washing to remove unbound anti - bodies , we stimulated cells with PDGF for 15 min to allow the antibody - bound integrins to undergo macropinocytosis . The pool that remained at the cell surface after this time period was removed by acid washing . Cells were chased for another 60 min in the presence of PDGF to allow the recycling of the antibody - bound integrin . This protocol revealed that internalized integrin  3 reappeared in focal adhesions on the ventral surface and , thus , confirmed that endocytic recycling was involved in its redistri - bution ( Fig . 2 D ) . Growth factor – induced integrin recycling follows a route of macropinosomes → early endosomes → recycling endosomes → cell surface Next , we found that , after PDGF - stimulated macropinocytosis , integrin  3 accumulated at perinuclear regions , where it exhib - ited increased colocalization with early endosome markers EEA1 ( Fig . 3 A ) , Rab5 ( Fig . 3 B ) , and Rab4 ( Fig . 3 C ) and the recycling endosome marker Rab11 ( Fig . 3 D ) . Image quantifi - cation revealed that the extent of such colocalization induced by PDGF was more than fivefold compared with no stimulation ( Fig . 3 E ) . Thus , the data suggests that internalized integrin  3 after stimulation by growth factors resulted in its recycling through early and recycling endosomes . Figure 2 .

Bars : ( A and B ) 20 µm ; ( A and B , insets ) 5 µm ; ( D ) 100 µm . 65 Integrins traffic rapidly via macropinocytosis • Gu et al . ( Fig . 4 G , t = 5 min , z = 3 . 2 µm , arrowheads ; and Video 4 ) . However , these CDRs did not fully condense and failed to form macropinosomes ( Fig . 4 G , t = 8 min , z = 2 . 4 µm and t = 10 min , z = 4 . 0 µm , arrowheads ; and Video 4 ) . Note that the strongest GFP fluorescence signal moved from z = 3 . 2 µm down to z = 2 . 4 µm and then back up to z = 4 . 0 µm without macropinosome for - mation , suggesting that the CDR cup was still able to invaginate but could not close to form macropinosomes when BARS was silenced . Previously , we had observed the reappearance of inte - grin  3 in focal adhesions on the ventral surface after PDGF stimulation ( Fig . 1 D , t = 21 min ; and Video 2 ) . However , such targeted redistribution was inhibited in cells with BARS siRNA , as these cells exhibited integrin  3 to be more diffusely distrib - uted over the cell surface ( Fig . 4 G , t = 28 min and t = 60 min ; and Video 4 ) . Further , we found that PDGF stimulation could no longer induce enhanced colocalization of integrin  3 with EEA1 at perinuclear regions after macropinocytosis ( Fig . 5 , B and F ) . Consistent with these findings , live - imaging videos revealed that cells treated with siRNA against BARS showed a reduced ability to migrate upon PDGF stimulation ( Video 4 ) . Quantifying the number of integrin  3 focal adhesions per cell showed BARS down - regulation did not block the rapid focal adhesion disassembly upon PDGF stimulation . However , it did block subsequent integrin  3 recycling to form new focal adhe - sions ( Fig . S2 C ) . Thus , we conclude that the inhibition of macropinocytosis by BARS down - regulation blocked the inter - nalization of integrin  3 and its subsequent recycling as well as cell migration . Clathrin - mediated endocytosis has been reported to regu - late basal integrin turnover at focal adhesions ( Nishimura and Kaibuchi , 2007 ; Teckchandani et al . , 2009 ) , and CAV1 has been reported to associate with integrins at focal adhesions ( Wary et al . , 1998 ; Wei et al . , 1999 ) . In addition , the actin remodeling – regulating protein WAVE1 blocks PDGF - stimulated CDR formation ( Suetsugu et al . , 2003 ) . Thus , we examined the effects of perturbing clathrin and CAV1 as well as WAVE1 after PDGF stimulation . First , we confirmed that siRNA against clathrin heavy chain ( CHC ) , CAV1 , and WAVE1 resulted in significant protein down - regulation ( Fig . 4 A ) . A transferrin endocytosis assay showed that CHC down - regulation functionally blocked clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( Fig . S2 B ) . Neither CHC nor CAV1 down - regulation blocked integrin  3 CDR formation and sub - sequent macropinosome formation . In contrast , WAVE1 down - regulation blocked this process , suggesting that actin remodeling is required for integrin translocation to CDRs ( Fig . 4 , B and C ) . Consistent with this , flow cytometry indicated that , after CHC or CAV1 down - regulation , the MFI of surface integrin  3 in the whole cell population still dropped by > 13 % after PDGF stimulation . In contrast , WAVE1 down - regulation blocked this process ( Fig . 4 , D and E ) . Furthermore , CHC or CAV1 Figure 3 .

The temporal and 67 Integrins traffic rapidly via macropinocytosis • Gu et al . cell migration ( Regen and Horwitz , 1992 ) . Integrins were previ - ously noted at cell edge membrane ruffles ( Bretscher , 2008 ; Sung et al . , 2008 ) . CDRs are distinct from cell edge membrane ruffles in terms of their location , formation , signaling , and especially their link to macropinocytosis . Here , we report that CDRs also rapidly recruit a majority of the cell surface integrins and inter - nalize them through macropinocytosis for subsequent fast re - cycling . These results provide direct evidence to support the hypothesis that CDRs function as indicators of cellular transition from static to motile states ( Buccione et al . , 2004 ) . Macropino - cytosis is known to mediate the bulk uptake of membranes , fluid , and signaling receptors . Our findings suggest that macropino - cytosis also can participate in the very rapid turnover of cell surface integrins , a pathway that is critical for stimulated cell migration . Materials and methods Mice and cell culture Wild - type C57BL / 6 mice were maintained as homozygous inbred lines in the Dana - Farber Cancer Institute animal facility . All mice were male and 8 – 12 wk old at the time of the study . Mouse experiments followed Institu - tional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines . Primary wild - type mouse synovial fibroblasts were recovered from normal mouse joints and were cul - tured in DME supplemented with 10 % FBS ( Hyclone ) , l - glutamine , penicillin / streptomycin , 2 - mercaptoethanol , and essential and nonessential amino acids at 37°C under 10 % CO 2 . Cells had fibroblast - like morphology and were VCAM - 1 positive but lacked F4 / 80 and were CD45 negative by flow cytometry ( Lee et al . , 2007 ; Agarwal et al . , 2008 ) . Cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen unless otherwise indicated . Retrieved mouse synovial fibroblasts were used between passages 5 and 10 . NIH3T3 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in DME supplemented with 10 % bovine calf serum ( Hyclone ) , l - glutamine , and penicillin / streptomycin at 37°C under 10 % CO 2 . MDA - MB - 231 human breast cancer cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in American Type Culture Collection – formulated Leibovitz’s L - 15 medium supplemented with 10 % FBS , l - glutamine , and penicillin / streptomycin at 37°C without CO 2 .

Plasmids , siRNA , and transfection cDNA encoding the full - length mouse integrin  3 – EGFP fusion protein in a pcDNA3 expression vector was a gift from B . Wehrle - Haller ( University of Geneva , Geneva , Switzerland ; Ballestrem et al . , 2001 ) . siRNA against BARS ( Yang et al . , 2005 ) , CHC ( Li et al . , 2007 ) , and WAVE1 ( Suetsugu et al . , 2003 ) were previously described . siRNAs against CAV1 , Rab4A , and Rab4B were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology , Inc . Nonsilencing negative control siRNA was purchased from QIAGEN . Plasmids were transfected with Lipofectamine LTX reagent ( Invitrogen ) , and siRNAs were transfected with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent ( Invitrogen ) . Antibodies Armenian hamster anti – integrin  3 ( clone 2C9 . G2 ) , mouse anti - EEA1 , mouse anti - Rab5 , mouse anti - Rab4 , mouse anti - Rab11 , mouse anti - WAVE1 , mouse anti - CAV1 , and rat anti – integrin  1 ( clone Ha2 / 5 ) antibodies were pur - chased from BD . Nonblocking rat anti – integrin  3 antibody ( clone 1 – 55 - 4 ) was obtained from MBL International . The rat anti – integrin  1 antibody ( clone MB1 . 2 ) was obtained from Millipore . The mouse anti – integrin  1 antibody ( clone 12G10 ) was obtained from Abcam . The rabbit anticortactin down - regulation did not block integrin  3 macropinosome for - mation or its subsequent recycling in the endocytosis and re - cycling assay , whereas WAVE1 down - regulation did ( Fig . 4 F and Fig . S2 , G  I ) . Finally , we found that PDGF stimulation still enhanced colocalization of integrin  3 with EEA1 at perinuclear regions after macropinocytosis in CHC and CAV1 down - regulated cells but not in WAVE1 down - regulated cells ( Fig . 5 , C – F ) . Quan - tification of the number of integrin  3 focal adhesions per cell showed CHC or CAV1 down - regulation did not block focal adhesion disassembly or subsequent integrin  3 recycling to form new focal adhesions , whereas WAVE1 down - regulation did block focal adhesion disassembly , and thus , the number of integrin  3 focal adhesions per cell remained almost unchanged over time ( Fig . S2 C ) . Next , we examined fast cell migration using cells seeded in the upper chamber of Transwells with vitronectin - coated membranes . After 2 h of cell adhesion to the membrane , PDGF was added to the lower chamber , and cell migration across the membrane for 2 h was assessed to quantitate stimulated fast cell migration . As a control , we targeted integrin  3 or both integrin  3 and integrin  1 with blocking antibodies . These results con - firmed that stimulated cell migration on vitronectin is integrin dependent . As previous experiments showed that PDGF - stimulated recycling of integrin  3 required Rab4 ( Roberts et al . , 2001 ) , we also found that siRNA against Rab4 decreased this cell migration . We found that PDGF - stimulated fast cell migration was significantly delayed by siRNA against BARS or WAVE1 , whereas such a fast cell migration was only slightly delayed by siRNA against CHC or CAV1 ( Fig . 5 , G and H ; and Fig . S2 D ) . These results suggest that clathrin - or CAV1 - dependent consti - tutive integrin turnover plays only a minor role in growth factor – stimulated fast cell migration . In contrast , WAVE1 - dependent CDR formation , BARS - dependent integrin macropinocytosis , and subsequent Rab4 - dependent integrin recycling contributed significantly to growth factor – stimulated fast cell migration . In conclusion , we found that cell surface integrins in focal adhesions undergo internalization by macropinocytosis after stimulation by growth factors ( summarized in Fig . 5 I ) . This result is in contrast to those previously observed for surface integrins at disassembling focal adhesions , which have been observed to undergo clathrin - or CAV1 - mediated endocytosis . As the previous observations were made under conditions that did not involve the addition of growth factors , a likely explana - tion is that integrins use clathrin - or CAV1 - mediated endocytosis under basal conditions and BARS - dependent macropinocytosis under the growth factor – stimulated conditions studied here . Sub - sequently , the internalized integrins undergo a recycling itinerary similar to that previously documented for how integrins recycle in stimulated cells ( Powelka et al . , 2004 ) . Notably , this itinerary also explains why integrins were observed to move both along the cell surface and also through internal vesicular routes during spatial translocation of integrin  3 – GFP was traced by 4D time - lapse confocal live - cell imaging as in Fig . 1 D . Arrows in the t = 0 min image denote the integrin  3 – GFP at original focal adhesions ; arrows in t = 28 min and 60 min images point at the same positions to denote the disappearance of integrin  3 – GFP at focal adhesions without integrin  3 – GFP recycling to form new focal adhesions . Arrowheads in t = 5 min , 8 min , and 10 min images denote the integrin  3 – GFP at a CDR that did not fully close up or sink into the cytosol to form macropinosomes because of the lack of the BARS protein .

Fluores - cent 3D or 4D image reconstructions and protein colocalization analysis were performed in MetaMorph Imaging software ( version 7 . 6 . 1 . 0 ; Univer - sal Imaging ) . Flow cytometry Cells were detached by a brief incubation with 0 . 05 % trypsin - EDTA ( Invit - rogen ) at RT to minimize endocytosis . Trypsin was quenched by a trypsin inhibitor from Glycine max ( soybean ; Sigma - Aldrich ) . Cells were then washed by 2 % FBS in PBS and stained with anti – integrin  3 monoclonal antibody ( 1 – 55 - 4 ) or isotype control antibody for 1 h at RT followed by Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody staining . After staining , cells were fixed in 1 % paraformaldehyde in PBS and subjected to flow cytometry analysis by a flow cytometer ( FACS Canto ; BD ) . FlowJo software ( Tree Star ) was used to analyze the flow cytometry data . Cell migration assay 56 h after siRNA transfection , cells were serum starved for another 16 h and detached by a brief incubation with 0 . 05 % trypsin - EDTA at RT .
