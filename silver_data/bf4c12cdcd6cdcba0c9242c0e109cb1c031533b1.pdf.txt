While the general features of these activities are well documented , less is under - stood about the regulation of these activities . The ATPase rate is stimulated by non - native proteins , furthermore , interaction with ATP leads to the release of protein substrate concurrent with a conformational change in Hsp7O . One interpretation of these data is that the two domains of Hsp7O interact . In the process of mapping the carboxyl - terminal boundary of the substrate binding domain for human Hsp7O , we identified a regulatory motif , EEVD , which is conserved at the extreme carboxyl terminus among nearly all cloned cytosolic eukaryotic Hsp7Os . Deletion or muta - tion of EEVD affects the ATPase activity , the ability to interact with substrates , and interferes with the ability of the mutant Hsp7O to interact with HDJ - 1 in the refolding of denatured firefly luciferase . Examina - tion of the biophysical properties of the mutant Hsp7Os reveals a change in the overall shape and conformation of the protein consistent with reduced interactions between the two domains . These data suggest that the EEVD motif is involved in the intramolecular regulation of Hsp7O function and intermolecular inter - actions with HDJ - 1 . Key words : chaperones / Hsp7O / protein folding Introduction The Hsp7O family of molecular chaperones is ubiquitous and highly conserved with diverse biochemical roles in events including protein synthesis , protein translocation , protein - mediated protein folding , uncoating of clathrin - coated vesicles , protein degradation and modulating gene expression ( Tilly et al . , 1983 ; Ungewickell et al . , 1985 ; Munro and Pelham , 1986 ; Chirico et al . , 1988 ; Murakami et al . , 1988 ; Chiang et al . , 1989 ; Beckmann et al . , 1990 ; Skowyra et al . , 1990 ; Stone and Craig , 1990 ; Abravaya et al . , 1992 ; Nelson et al . , 1992 ; Shi and Thomas , 1992 ) . In humans , the Hsp7O multi - gene family includes the cytosolic and nuclear localized Hsc7O and Hsp7O , endo - plasmic reticulum localized Grp78 ( BiP ) and mito - chondrial localized MtHsp75 ( Grp75 ) ( Hunt and Morimoto , 1985 ; Wu et al . , 1985 ; Dwomiczak and Mirault , 1987 ; Ting and Lee , 1988 ; Bhattacharyya et al . , 1995 ) . Hsc7O , MtHsp75 and Grp78 are abundantly expressed during normal growth conditions and the level of each protein is induced to various extents in response to specific types of stress . In contrast , the levels of Hsp7O are growth regulated ( Wu et al . , 1985 ; Milarski and Morimoto , 1986 ) and strongly induced by a variety of conditions of physiological and environmental stress ( Morimoto et al . , 1992 ) . The 70 kDa chaperones contain two functional domains , an amino - terminal 45 kDa ATP binding domain and a carboxyl - terminal 25 kDa substrate binding domain . The crystal structure of the 45 kDa fragment of bovine Hsc7O reveals a bi - lobed domain with a deep cleft in which the ATP molecule is bound ( Flaherty et al . , 1990 ) . The carboxyl domain is sufficient and necessary for substrate binding , however , regulation of the substrate binding activity does not occur in the absence of the ATP binding domain ( Chappell et al . , 1987 ; Milarski and Morimoto , 1989 ; Haus et al . , 1993 ; Tsai and Chang , 1994 ) . An indication that sequences other than the ATP binding and substrate binding domains are important was provided by the analysis of a 60 kDa fragment of bovine Hsc7O ( amino acids 1 - 543 ) which could bind to clathrin cages , yet was incapable of stimulating disassembly of the clathrin cage ( Chappell et al . , 1987 ) . The ATPase activity of the 60 kDa fragment of human Hsc7O was stimulated by protein substrate , indicating that both activities were present , but perhaps not regulated properly ( Tsai and Chang , 1994 ) . It is generally considered that the diverse activities of Hsp7Os reflect their primary role in association with nascent peptide chains and non - native proteins ( Craig et al . , 1994 ; Frydman and Hartl , 1994 ; Georgopoulos et al . , 1994 ; Hightower et al . , 1994 ) . Although there are reports that Hsp7Os can function alone to prevent protein aggregation and assist in the refolding of denatured sub - strates , members of the Hsp7O family often require inter - actions with specific members of the co - chaperone DnaJ family for efficient protein folding and translocation ( Caplan et al . , 1993 ) . Following these initial events , import of nascent chains into the mitochondria requires the mitochondrial homologs of Hsp7O ( mtHsp75 ) - DnaJ and subsequent interactions with Hsp6O ( GroEL ) to acquire the final folded state ( Ostermann et al . , 1989 ; Kang et al . , 1990 ) . Likewise , in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum , the Hsp7O homolog ( Grp78 ) associates with the translocated nascent chain . The events involved in the folding of cytosolic proteins are less well characterized . TCP - 1 has been identified as a cytosolic homolog to GroEL ( Lewis et al . , 1992 ) , however , only a few proteins K Oxford University Press 2281 B . C . Freeman et aL ( P3 - actin , a - and P - tubulin ) are known to require this chaperone for folding ( Gao et al . , 1992 ; Yaffe et al . , 1992 ) . In this study we have addressed the question of how the ATPase and substrate binding domains of the cytosolic Hsp7Os are regulated . We have identified an acidic motif , EEVD , located at the extreme carboxyl terminus of nearly all Hsp7Os which has an essential role in regulating the biochemical properties of Hsp7O and interactions with HDJ - 1 . Results Identification of the sequences required for substrate recognition : deletion from the carboxyl terminus of Hsp7O interferes with substrate recognition The ability of recombinant human Hsp7O to distinguish between native a - lactalbumin and reduced carboxy - methylated lactalbumin ( RCMLA ) as substrates was examined using gel filtration ( Figure 1 ; Palleros et al . , 1991 ) . RCMLA and a - lactalbumin were labeled with 125I , incubated with wild type or mutant Hsp7O protein , and the bound and free populations of a - lactalbumin or RCMLA were separated by chromatography . Gel filtration of either protein alone yields a single symmetric peak , whereas - 50 % of the RCMLA elutes as a RCMLA - Hsp7O complex following incubation with wild type Hsp7O ( Figure 1 ) . Wild type Hsp7O does not form a stable complex with a - lactalbumin which demonstrates that Hsp7O binds preferentially to the non - native protein . The location of the Hsp7O substrate binding domain was mapped using deletion mutants of human Hsp7O . The boundaries of the Hsp7O mutants are shown schematically in Figure 2A and the homogeneity of the purified recom - binant proteins is indicated in Figure 2B . Comparison of the binding data for the mutant Hsp7Os reveals that deletion within the carboxyl domain severely reduces RCMLA binding activity , whereas loss of the residues in the amino terminus does not diminish substrate binding ( Figure 2A ) . Comparison of mutant ANSBt ( residues 415 - 640 ) which binds substrate , and ANSSmat ( residues 437 - 640 ) which cannot , establishes the amino - terminal boundaries of the substrate , binding domain between amino acids 415 and 436 . Three mutants ( ASmat , ABCt and ACRt ) containing internal carboxyl - terminal deletions were unable to bind to RCMLA , whereas two mutants ( 386 - 640t and ANSBt ) retaining the corresponding sequences in the carboxyl terminus bind to substrate ( Figure 2C ) . To establish the carboxyl - terminal boundary , we examined deletion mutants with carboxyl termini at residues 543 , 567 or 611 . As shown in Figure 2C and summarized in Figure 2A , loss of any carboxyl - terminal sequence beyond residue 611 resulted in the complete loss of binding activity . However , a small internal deletion within the extreme carboxyl terminus ( A616 - 625 ) had no apparent effect on the substrate binding activity . These data reveal that the carboxyl terminus is necessary and sufficient for substrate binding . Deletion of the EEVD residues affects the ability of Hsp7O to bind to RCMLA The results of carboxyl - terminal deletion analysis suggest that sequences between residues 626 and 640 are important 0 a - lactalbuniin Alone _ - WT Hsp7O + a - lactalbumin - 0 - - RCMLA Alone 35 30 - 25 5 0 . 1 - 4 20 15 10 1 5 9 13 17 21 25 fraction number Fig . 1 . Wild type Hsp7O specifically binds to the 125I - radiolabeled non - native form of a - lactalbumin . Samples containing ax - lactalbumin alone , Hsp7O + a - lactalbumin , RCMLA alone , or Hsp7O + RCMLA were incubated prior to resolution over a gel filtration column . The data are presented as per cent of total substrate in the reaction . for Hsp7O function . Therefore we examined the amino acid sequences in this region of - 46 members of the Hsp7O family for which nucleotide sequence information is available . Of these , 36 sequences , corresponding to cytosolic Hsp7Os from diverse eukaryotic species , had the terminal acidic motif , EEVD ( Figure 3 ) . To examine the potential role of EEVD in Hsp7O function , we generated a collection of deletion and point mutants in the EEVD sequence to study the biochemical properties ofthe purified recombinant proteins ( Figure 4 ) . Comparison of the substrate binding properties of the wild type and mutant Hsp7Os revealed that deletion of EEVD or alanine substitution ( AAAA ) of EEVD had a striking negative effect ( Figure 4A ) . Substitution of both glutamic acids residues ( AAVD ) reduces the fraction of bound RCMLA to near background levels ( Table I ) . The inability of these mutant Hsp7O proteins to bind RCMLA does not appear to be simply due to the net loss of two negatively charged residues as the mutant AEVA retained the ability to bind to substrate ( Table I and Figure 4B ) . The substrate binding results were corroborated using a native gel shift assay in which the complex between the radiolabeled RCLMA and Hsp7O is detected on a native acrylamide gel . Consistent with the results obtained by gel filtration , radiolabeled RCMLA formed a stable com - plex with wild type Hsp7O and not with AEEVD , AAAA or AAVD ( Figure 4B ) . Single non - conservative substitu - tions of EEVD reduced the fraction of RCMLA bound by 25 % except for substitution of the second glutamic acid residue in EEVD which reduced binding by 50 % ( Table I ) . The selectivity of the mutant phenotype was revealed by the mutants EEAA , AEVA , EAVD , AEVD and EEKD , all of which retained the ability to bind to RCMLA as measured by either binding assay ( Figure 4 and Table I ) . Additionally , the results of the gel shift assay corroborated the results of the gel filtration assay on the inability of 2282 Regulatory domains of Hsp7O C 10 - l . . . : A c I . - , " ! . - - s MN 1 - 611 to bind to RCMLA ( Figure 4B ) . To examine whether the role of EEVD in substrate binding was unique to inducible Hsp7O , we compared the binding properties of the constitutively expressed human Hsc7O with that of two carboxyl - terminal deletion mutants of the corresponding EEVD residues in Hsc7O . As shown in Figure 5 , deletion of EEVD ( c 1 - 642 ) in Hsc7O led to a 3 - fold reduction in RCMLA bound . Further truncation to residue 544 ( cl1 - 544 ) had no apparent additional effect on the substrate binding activity in comparison to the EEVD deletion mutant . Although the results using the RCMLA binding assay are somewhat less dramatic for Hsc7O than with Hsp7O , taken together , they offer support for the involvement of the EEVD motif in substrate binding . Alteration or deletion of EEVD alters the ATPase activity Another common feature of Hsp7Os is ATP binding and ATP hydrolysis ( - 3 pmol / min4tg of protein ; Sadis and Hightower , 1993 ) . The intrinsic ATPase is enhanced upon interaction with malfolded protein substrates . Relative to the ATPase activity of wild type Hsp7O , deletion or non - conservative substitution of both glutamic acids ( AAAA and AAVD ) has a 1 . 5 - to 2 . 5 - fold stimulatory effect ( Table I ) . Substitution of the aspartic acid residue ( EEAA and AEVA ) slightly decreased the ATPase rate relative to e RCMNT .

Following incubation , the binding reactions were resolved over a Superose - 12 column and the data are plotted as per cent of total amount of substrate . wild type . We also examined the peptide - stimulated ATPase and found that RCMLA had a stimulatory effect even on those mutants ( AEEVD , AAVD and AAAA ) that did not form a stable complex with RCMLA , as tested by gel filtration or native gel electrophoresis . Taken together , these data reveal that complete deletion of EEVD and complete ( AAAA ) or partial alanine substitution of these residues ( AAVD ) leads to a severe loss in substrate binding and an enhanced ATPase activity . In contrast to these severe phenotypes , substitution of single amino acids has a much weaker phenotype . Mutations in EEVD affect the overall conformation of Hsp7O One interpretation of the previous data on ATPase rates and substrate - recognition properties is that the EEVD motif could have a role in regulating both activities . This could be accomplished if the EEVD motif influenced the overall conformation of Hsp7O and consequently affected activities of both domains . To address this , we used a combination of biochemical and biophysical approaches to probe the conformation of the native wild type and mutant Hsp7Os . The fluorescence emission spectrum of tryptophan residues can provide a measure of the conformational state of a protein . This method can detect subtle changes in the conformation of a protein as long as the change ( s ) include the area surrounding the tryptophan . Hsp7O has 2283 . 1 " Stra - . - I , .

The EEVD motif is indicated as shaded . two tryptophan residues at position 78 in the ATP binding domain and at position 579 in the carboxyl - terminal domain . The tryptophan fluorescence emission spectrum was determined for four selected proteins ( wild type , AEEVD , AEVD and AAAA ) . Wild type Hsp7O exhibits a maximum absorbance at 334 nm whereas the AEEVD and AAAA mutant proteins exhibited decreased fluores - cence and a shift to 332 nm in their maxima ( Figure 6 ) . While our data reflect the sum absorbance properties of both tryptophans , these data suggest that the conformation of the mutant proteins is altered . The Stokes ' radii and frictional ratios for the wild type and mutant proteins were determined to obtain independent measures of the conformation of Hsp7O ( Table I ) . The AEVD protein had a slightly larger Stokes ' radius and frictional ratio ( f / f0 ) than wild type . The Stokes ' radius and flfo increased from 44 A and 1 . 58 , as measured for the wild type , to 51 A and 1 . 83 for the AEEVD protein . The changes in the physical properties of the mutants correlate with the functional data for the various proteins ; the AEEVD and AAAA proteins exhibited similar proper - ties and the properties for the AEVD protein were inter - mediate between the wild type and AEEVD or AAAA proteins . The conformation of the wild type and mutant Hsp7Os was also examined through the use of limit proteolytic digestion ( Deluca - Flaherty et al . , 1990 ; Liberek et al . , 1991a ) . We first examined the proteolytic sensitivity of wild type Hsp7O in the presence of trypsin ( Figure 7A , upper left panel ) . The stability of the full length wild type Hsp7O could be enhanced by the addition of either ATP ( upper right panel ) or RCMLA ( lower right panel ) , however , addition of a - lactalbumin ( lower left panel ) had no apparent effect , as quantified and presented in Figure 7A . Digestion of the AEEVD protein under the same conditions ( Figure 7B ) revealed that the mutant protein was more rapidly hydrolyzed , yet the addition of ATP or substrate resulted in an increased stability . We next compared the protease sensitivity of the mutants AEVD and AAAA and observed that the kinetics of degradation of AAAA protein were comparable to AEEVD and that the kinetics of the AEVD were intermediate between the wild type , AEEVD and AAAA proteins . These results , together with the ATPase data , support the conclusion that the AEEVD protein interacts with RCMLA despite its inability to form stable complexes with RCMLA . To examine whether the increased protease sensitivity exhibited by the EEVD mutants is due to misfolding of either the ATP - or substrate binding domain , we used monoclonal antibodies to Hsp7O specific to either the amino ( 5A5 ) or carboxyl ( 3A3 ) terminus to probe Western blots of protease - treated wild type and AEEVD protein . Under these conditions of trypsin digestion , wild type Hsp7O was essentially unaffected ( Figure 8 , top left , lower left panels ) . In contrast , the AEEVD protein was digested to a stable 45 kDa amino - terminal fragment ( upper right panel ) and 25 kDa carboxyl fragment ( lower right panel ) . These data reveal that the AEEVD protein exhibits an increased digestion with trypsin at a cleavage site located between the 45 kDa amino and 25 kDa carboxyl - terminal domains . These results suggest that the conformational difference ( s ) between the wild type Hsp7O and AEEVD protein are not specifically localized to either the amino or carboxyl domain but rather that the intra - domain interaction ( s ) have been altered . 2284 B .

( B ) Analysis of RCLMA binding to wild type and mutant Hsp7Os using a native gel electrophoresis assay . The free and bound iodinated RCMLA is indicated . The EEVD motif couples substrate recognition and the ATPase domain To examine whether the inability of mutant Hsp7O to form a stable complex with RCMLA is due to a direct requirement for EEVD in substrate binding or alternatively , that EEVD interacts with the ATP binding domain , we determined the substrate binding activities of wild type and mutant Hsp7Os lacking the ATP binding domain . The carboxyl terminus ( residues 386 - 640 ) of wild type or mutant ( AAVD or AAAA ) Hsp7O was overexpressed , purified and used for the gel filtration substrate binding assay . As shown in Figure 9 , the wild type and mutant Hsp7O carboxyl - terminal domains bind equally well to RCMLA , in contrast to the results obtained with the mutant Hsp7Os containing the ATP binding domain ( Table I ; Figure 4A ) . One interpretation of these data is that the ability of EEVD to modulate binding of substrate or access to the substrate - recognition domain is influenced by the ATP binding domain . These data , in conjunction with the tryptic digestion data , suggest that alteration of the EEVD residues does not directly affect the substrate binding domain but rather alters the interaction between the amino and carboxyl domains . Finally , our ability to perform substrate binding studies with carboxyl - terminal fragments of Hsp7O lacking the ATP binding domain would suggest that it should be 2285 B A , - f 1 lqw - - 9 : B .

Carboxyl domain fragments retaining residues 386 - 578 or 386 - 567 did not bind RCMLA using either gel filtration or native gel electrophoresis , and the recombinant protein retaining residues 386 - 611 is synthesized as an insoluble aggregate . EEVD is required for Hsp7O function in luciferase refolding We assessed the biochemical consequence of the reduced ability of the Hsp7O mutants , AEEVD and AAAA , to form a stable substrate complex using another assay which measures the reactivation of denatured firefly luciferase in the presence of the heat shock proteins , Hsp7O ( Hsc7O ) and HDJ - 1 ( human DnaJ homolog ; Raabe and Manley , 1991 ) . As shown in Figure 10 , luciferase activity was not recovered by the addition of wild type human Hsp7O , Hsc7O , HDJ - 1 or DnaK in the presence of ATP ( Figure IOA ) nor by various combinations of Hsp7O or Hsc7O + HDJ - 1 in the absence of ATP ( Figure lOB ) . However , the addition of either Hsp7O or Hsc7O together with HDJ - 1 and ATP reactivated denatured luciferase as measured by the time - dependent reappearance of luciferase activity ( Figure lOC and D ) . In contrast to the ability of wild type Hsp7O or Hsc7O to reactivate luciferase , the AEEVD or AAAA mutants were non - functional in this assay . These results corroborate the RCMLA binding data ; furthermore they provide direct functional evidence that the EEVD residues have an important role in Hsp7O activity . These results also indicate the specificity of HDJ - 1 interaction between Hsp7O and Hsc7O in the cooperative refolding of denatured firefly luciferase . Despite an apparent equivalent RCMLA binding activity ( Figures 4 and 5 ) refolding of luciferase was both kinetically faster and more efficient with Hsc7O and HDJ - 1 than with Hsp7O and HDJ - 1 . Specificity of interaction with HDJ - 1 is also evident in the inability of DnaK and HDJ - 1 to refold luciferase . 2286 Regulatory domains of Hsp7O A Alone kDl a MN 3 15 34 ) 60 nmn .

Following protease treatment the products were resolved by SDS - PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue . The full length wild type or AEEVD protein coresponding to the undigested protein was quantified by laser densiotometry . The EEVD motif is required for stimulation of the ATPase activity by HDJ - 1 The evidence that the EEVD motif is essential for the Hsp7O - and HDJ - 1 - dependent refolding of luciferase suggests that HDJ - 1 does not interact with certain mutants of Hsp7O . Therefore , we examined the effect of HDJ - 1 on the ATPase rate of wild type and mutant Hsp7Os based on the properties of the Escherichia coli homolog , DnaJ , which is known to stimulate the ATPase activity of DnaK above its intrinsic rate ( Liberek et al . , 199 ib ) . The addition of increasing concentrations of HDJ - 1 stimulated the ATPase activity of wild type Hsp7O and the AEVD mutant 2287 B . C . Freeman et al .

The conformation of the AEEVD protein is affected at the hinge region separating the ATP and substrate binding domains . Trypsin digestion products of the wild type Hsp7O ( left panels ) or AEEVD ( right panels ) were subjected to Western blot analysis using monoclonal antibodies specific for either the amino ( 5A5 ; upper panels ) or carboxyl terminus ( 3A3 ; lower panels ) . The lower intensity of the - 70 kDa band present in the upper left panel ( 0 . 05 , ug trypsin lanes ) is due to incomplete transfer . The predominant proteolytic product detected by antibody 5A5 in AEEVD protein is 45 kDa and by antibody 3A3 is 25 kDa . by a factor of 2 . 5 - fold , whereas the ATPase activity of the AEEVD or AAAA mutants was unaffected by HDJ - 1 ( Figure 11 ) . These results parallel the phenotype of the same mutants in the luciferase refolding assays and suggests that the EEVD residues of Hsp7O may be involved in interaction with the co - chaperone HDJ - 1 . Discussion The analysis of mutations in human Hsp7O has identified a motif located at the extreme carboxyl terminus that is essential for intramolecular coupling of ATP and substrate binding activities and for intermolecular interactions between Hsp7O and HDJ - 1 . The functional properties of the EEVD motif appear to be common to both Hsp7O and Hsc7O which lends additional support for its role in regulating the activities of eukaryotic cytosolic Hsp7Os . A number of observations suggest an interdependence of the amino - and carboxyl - terminally localized activities of Hsp7Os . In the presence of nucleotide , the non - native protein substrate is released ( Flynn et al . , 1989 ) ; likewise , the ATPase is stimulated by binding to the substrate . As we have shown here , deletion or alanine substitution of the EEVD motif affects the activities in the ATP - and substrate binding domains . Although our data does not identify the sites of intramolecular interaction for EEVD , an interaction between EEVD and the ATP binding domain seems rational . Additional evidence to support a role for EEVD as a cis - regulatory sequence in Hsp7O follows from the substrate binding studies of the EEVD mutants . While stable substrate interactions do not occur for the EEVD deletion or alanine substitution mutants which have the ATP binding domain , mutant Hsp7Os altered in the EEVD motif and lacking the ATP binding domain can bind to 25 RCMLA Alone - - * - - 386 - 640 WT + RCMLA 20 - - - 386 - 640 AAAA + RCMLA - - * - - 386 - 640 AAVD + RCMLA 15 10 5 4 . 2 do , I 0 ' 0 5 10 15 20 fraction number Fig . 9 .

RCMLA binding activities of wild type and two mutant ( AAVD and AAAA ) recombinant proteins of the carboxyl domain ( amino acids 386 - 640 ) were determined by gel filtration . The percentage of total labeled RCMLA in each fraction is indicated . substrate . This proposed interaction between the EEVD motif and the ATP binding domain is further supported by the trypsin digestion studies of the EEVD mutants which show that the hinge region separating the ATP and substrate binding domains is more accessible . In addition to the intrinsic activities of substrate - and ATP binding , the Hsp7Os interact with other heat shock proteins and molecular chaperones . For example , in E . coli , proteins that stimulate the ATPase activity of DnaK include 2288 _ wo q Regulatory domains of Hsp7O - 4 - BSA 4 . 8uM - ATP - _ - Hsp7O + HDJ - 1 - ATP 801 - - - Hsc7O + HDJ - 1 - ATP 60 t 40 ± 0 40 80 120 time ( minutes ) 160 200 u 0 0 40 80 120 time ( minutes ) - - 4 20 - = ; n 0 40 80 120 time ( minutes ) D + 0BSA - _ - Hsc7O + HDJ - 1 6 to u W - - - c1 - 642 + HDJ - 1 l - - - - c1 - 544 + HDJ - 1 8 0 DnaK + HDJ - 1 l 80 60 40 / 20 0 0 40 80 120 time ( minutes ) Fig . 10 . The EEVD motif is required by Hsp7O for reactivation of firefly luciferase . The per cent recovered activity of firefly luciferase in the presence of individual chaperones / co - chaperone in the absence or presence of ATP was calculated utilizing an equivalent amount of non - denatured luciferase .

Homologs to DnaJ are ubiquitous in eukaryotes , however , eukaryotic homologs to GrpE have only recently been identified in mitochondria ( Laloraya et al . , 1994 ) . The mechanism by which the DnaJs interact with Hsp7Os has not been established . The evidence presented here reveals that Hsp7Os deleted or substituted with alanine in EEVD cannot participate with HDJ - 1 either to stimulate the ATPase rate or in the refolding of denatured luciferase . These data suggest that the EEVD motif may be involved in the mechanism by which Hsp7O and HDJ - 1 function - ally interact . How are the EEVD residues involved in the regulation of Hsp7O function ? One possibility is that EEVD has a key role in the transition of the unliganded state of Hsp7O to the ligand ( ATP or substrate ) state . Binding to either site would affect the conformation of Hsp7O and consequently access of the EEVD motif for association with HDJ - 1 . The EEVD motif could alternate between intramolecular interactions with the ATP binding domain and inter - molecular interactions with HDJ - 1 . This would allow the cytosolic Hsp7Os to adopt different states of substrate interaction according to subsequent events with ATP and HDJ - 1 ( Cyr et al . , 1992 ) . Extending the period of interaction between a substrate and the 70 kDa chaperone may be useful during protein synthesis and protein trans - location , and in particular during exposure to physiologic - ally stressful conditions ( Beckmann et al . , 1990 ) . All of these conditions have in common the requirement that the substrate - chaperone complex is maintained until the protein is to be folded to its final conformation , trans - located , or until the physiological state of the cell is less stressful . An example of a well - studied heat shock protein complex is the progesterone receptor , in which the receptor protein is maintained in an inert complex with Hsp9O , Hsp7O and other proteins until the steroid is provided ( Bresnick et al . , 1988 ; Smith et al . , 1990 ) . Hsp9O also has the carboxyl - terminal EEVD motif and has been suggested to interact with DnaJ homologs in S . cerevisiae ( Y . Kimura , personal communication ) . Finally , in revisiting the question of the boundary of the substrate binding domain of Hsp7O , our results establish a requirement for sequences that extends well beyond the regions predicted to share structural similarities with the MHC molecule ( Flajnick et al . , 1991 ) . In contrast , the substrate binding domain of Hsc7O , while dependent on the EEVD motif , is less dependent as indicated by our data and previous observations ( Chappell et al . , 1987 ; 2289 A 100 T B - BSA - _ - Hsp7O - * - HC7O - - e - - HDJ - 1 DnaK 80t 60t 100 - . _ - . 0 40t 20± 6 , u 20 1 C 160 200 100 - 80 60 + - + 0 BSA _ - - Hsp70 + HDJ - . - + - , EEVD + HDJ - - - 9 - - AEVD + HDJ - 1 0 - AAAA + HDJ - l - - - 1 - 543 + HDJ - 1 u 40 ± IpA 160 200 160 200 n 4 . 4 2 B .

HDJ - 1 does not stimulate the ATPase activity of the AEEVD and the AAAA mutants . The ATPase rates of wild type and mutant Hsp7O proteins were determined in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of HDJ - 1 . The specified amounts of HDJ - 1 correspond to Hsp7O : HDJ - 1 molar ratios of 0 , 2 : 1 , 1 : 1 , 1 : 2 , 1 : 5 and 1 : 10 . Tsai and Chang , 1994 ) . Thus , for Hsp7O , one possibility is that the carboxyl domain contains a structural component for substrate recognition and a separate region to regulate these interactions . Further studies will be required for a complete understanding of the binding and regulatory properties of Hsp7O and Hsc7O with substrates , interactions with nucleotides , and the nature of interactions with HDJ - 1 leading to stimulation of nucleotide hydrolysis and in the refolding of non - native proteins . Materials and methods Plasmid constructions The construction of pETWThsp7O , pETASmat and pGEXANSCt has been described ( Abravaya et al . , 1992 ) . Plasmids pETABCt , ACRt , A616 - 625 , ANSSmat and ANSBt were created by digestion at existing restriction endonuclease sites , mutants 1 - 543 , 386 - 640t , and 386 - 543 were created by site - directed mutagenesis , mutants 1 - 567 , 1 - 611 , c 1 - 544 , c 1 - 642 , and the deletion or point mutants of the EEVD residues were created using the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) and wild type Hsp7O or Hsc7O DNA as templates . The amplified DNA fragments were inserted into the vector , pGEX - 2T ( Pharmacia - LKB ) . The cloned fragments were digested with ClaI and EcoRI and inserted into the vector pMSI - 543 . The junctions of all deletion and point mutants in Hsp7O and Hsc7O were subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis . The HDJ - 1 cDNA ( Raabe and Manely , 1991 ) was shuttled into the pET - 21d vector ( Novagen ) utilizing PCR , specific oligonucleotide primers and the wild type DNA . In addition , all DNA segments that were amplified by PCR were sequenced in their entirety to ensure that other mutations had not randomly occurred . Protein purification The various gene constructs were transformed into either DH - 1 , BL21 / DE3 or BB 1553 cells ( Bukau and Walker , 1990 ) . Bacterial transformants containing hsp70 or hdj - 1 constructs were grown at 37°C ( DH - 1 or BL21 / DE3 ) or 31°C ( BB 1553 ) whereas transformants containing hsc70 constructs were grown at 25°C ( BL2I / DE3 ) . Protein extracts from IPTG - induced cells were prepared at 4°C and the recombinant proteins were purified by a combination of anion exchange and affinity chromatography . The crude extract was loaded onto a 200 ml DEAE fast flow Sepharose column ( Pharmacia - LKB ) and eluted with a 50 - 350 mM NaCI gradient over five column volumes . The fractions containing Hsp7O protein were pooled and recirculated over a 20 ml ATP - agarose column ( Sigma ; C - 8 linkage ) or 20 ml glutathione - agarose column ( Pharmacia - LKB ) washed with 2 . 0 M NaCl , equilibrated to 50 mM NaCl and eluted with 10 ml of column buffer containing 10 % glycerol and either 50 mM Mg - ATP or 50 mM glutathione , respectively . The Hsp7O - containing fractions were pooled , concentrated by ultrafiltration in a Centriprep - 10 ( Amicon ) , desalted over a G - 25 column and dialyzed for 4 h in 2 1 of 20 mM Tris ( pH 6 . 9 r . t . ) , 0 . 1 mM EDTA and 100 mM NaCl . The protein sample was then loaded onto a 6 ml ResourceQ column ( Pharmacia - LKB ) and eluted with a 50 - 400 mM NaCl gradient over five column volumes . The fractions containing Hsp7O protein were pooled , concentrated by ultrafiltration in a Centricon - 10 ( Amicon ) and dialyzed for 3 days against 20 mM Tris , pH 6 . 9 , 0 . 1 mM EDTA , 100 mM NaCl at 4°C . Following dialysis , the protein concentrations were determined as an average of three measurements utilizing the BCA assay ( Pierce ) relative to a standard solution of bovine serum albumin ( BSA ) . HDJ - 1 was purified according to the protocol defined by Zylicz et al . ( 1985 ) for the purification of Ecoli DnaJ . RCMLA binding assays Reduced carboxymethylated ax - lactalbumin ( RCMLA , Sigma ) was radio - iodinated using carrier free Nall251I ( NEN , DuPont ) and lodoBeads according to the manufacturer ( Pierce ) . For the gel filtration experiments , Hsp7O ( 14 , uM ) and iodinated RCMLA were combined at a 5 : 1 molar ratio in buffer B ( 20 mM HEPES pH 7 . 2 , 5 mM MgCl2 , 100 mM NaCl ) , incubated at 37°C for 30 min and resolved on a Superdex - 200 gel filtration column ( Pharmacia - LKB ) in buffer B at 4°C , at 0 . 25 ml / min . Based upon the determined apparent Kd ( 9 . 5 tM ) between wild type Hsp7O and RCMLA , a molar ratio of 5 : 1 Hsp7O : RCMLA was utilized to acheive 50 % RCMLA bound . The 1251 in each fraction was quantified in an IsoData 20 / 20 y - counter . The binding assays using native gel electrophoresis were performed with Hsp / Hsc7O proteins ( 14 jM final ) and iodinated RCMLA that were combined at a 5 : 1 molar ratio in buffer B , incubated at 37°C for 30 min and resolved over a 6 % acrylamide - 1 X TBE gel at 4°C . ATPase assays ATP hydrolysis was determined by measuring the release of [ 32p ] p ; from [ y - 32P ] ATP according to the protocol of Sadis and Hightower ( 1992 ) . The ATPase rates were determined utilizing an average [ y - 32P ] ATP hydrolysis rate at each time point ( 5 , 10 , 15 and 20 min ) from three separate experiments for each Hsp7O protein after the background hydrolysis had been subtracted . The data were visualized and quantified by Phosphorlmager analysis ( Molecular Dynamics ) . The effect of a protein substrate ( native a - lactalbumin or RCMLA ) on the ATPase rate was measured in a 1 : 20 Hsp7O : lactalbumin molar ratio prior to incubation at 370C . Limit proteolytic digestion in the presence of ATP or protein substrates Proteolytic cleavage was carried out at 37°C by incubation of the various Hsp7O proteins ( 5 , ug ) with trypsin ( 0 . 005 jig ) in buffer C with or without ATP ( 10 mM ) , a - lactalbumin or RCMLA . At the specified times samples were removed and the reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer and boiling for 3 min . The samples were then resolved on SDS - PAGE , stained with Coomassie Blue and quantified by laser densiotometry ( Pharmacia - LKB ) . For Western blot analysis , the samples were analyzed on SDS - PAGE and electro - blotted to nitrocellulose . After blocking in 5 % non - fat milk , the blots were probed with either the 3A3 monoclonal antibody , whose epitope is located between residues 503 and 524 of human Hsp7O ( S . Murphy , personal communication ) , or the SA5 monoclonal antibody , whose epitope is located between residues 124 and 264 of human Hsp7O , in PBS , 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 . After washing and probing with goat anti - mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate in PBS , 0 . 1 % Tween - 20 , the blot was rinsed and visualized by enhanced chemi - luminescence ( Amersham ECL kit ) . The migration distance of each protein was used to calculate their respective masses , relative to protein standards electrophoresed on the same gel . Luciferase renaturation assay The refolding of guanidinium - HCI denatured firefly luciferase followed the protocol described by Buchberger et al . ( 1994 ) . Firefly luciferase ( Sigma ) was prepared at 4 mg / ml in glycylglycine pH 7 . 4 and denatured by dilution into denaturation buffer ( 25 mM HEPES pH 7 . 5 , 50 mM 2290 Regulatory domains of Hsp7O KCI , 5 mM MgCI2 , 5 mM , B - mercaptoethanol and 6 M guanidine - HCl ) for 30 min at 37°C . The luciferase activity reactivation assays were as follows . An aliquot of the denatured protein solution ( 312 . 5 ng in 1 , ul total volume ) was added to 124 , ul of refolding buffer ( 25 mM HEPES pH 7 . 6 , 50 mM KCI , 5 mM MgCl2 , 1 mM DTT and 5 mM ATP ) supplemented with either HDJ - 1 ( 1 . 6 tM ) or an Hsp / Hsc7O protein ( 0 . 8 , uM ) . At the specified times I , ul of the refolding reaction was removed , added to 50 , ul of refolding buffer and the luciferase activity was measured using a luminometer ( Moonlight ) . The percent activities were calculated against 1 gi of luciferase which had been diluted to the same extent except only in refolding buffer . Fluorescence emission spectra , gel filtration and glycerol gradient sedimentation The fluorescence emission spectra were determined at 0 . 1 mg / ml in 20 mM HEPES , 5 mM MgCl2 and 100 mM NaCl . The samples were excited at a wavelength of 295 nm and the emmission was monitored between 300 and 400 nm in an a - scan ( Photon Technology International ) . The spectra presented are the smoothed average of three scans for each sample . Gel filtration analysis was performed using a 100 , l ( 1 mg / ml ) sample of each protein in buffer B and resolved over a Superdex - 200 column ( Pharmacia - LKB ) at 0 . 25 ml / min equilibrated in buffer B at 220C . A total of 25 0 . 5 ml fractions were collected , 12 . 5 ul of each fraction was resolved on a 10 % SDS - PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue . The elution volume for each protein was determined from the location of each protein ' s UV absorption peak ( 280 nm ) relative to the void volume of the column and utilized to approximate the native size and Stokes ' radius of each protein relative to standard curves . The standard curves were generated using known globular proteins of various molecular weights and Stokes ' radii . A least - squares algorithm ( KaleidaGraph ) was used to fit a line through the standard data points to yield standard curves with correlation coefficients of R = 0 . 99 . For glycerol gradient analysis , a 100 gu ( 1 mg / ml ) sample of each protein in buffer C was layered onto a 5 . 0 ml 10 - 30 % ( v / v ) glycerol gradient in buffer C and centrifuged in a Beckman SW6OTi rotor at 35 000 r . p . m . for either 20 h at 22°C or 36 h at 4°C . Fractions ( 250 lU ) were collected from the bottom of the gradient , 12 . 5 gl aliquots of each fraction were resolved on 13 % SDS - PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue . Two gradients containing protein standards ( alcohol dehydrogenase , 7 . 4 S ; bovine serum albumin , 4 . 3 S ; cytochrome c , 1 . 9 S ) were included in every experiment . The frictional ratio for each protein was determined utilizing the average sedimentation coefficient obtained from three separate gradients of each protein .
