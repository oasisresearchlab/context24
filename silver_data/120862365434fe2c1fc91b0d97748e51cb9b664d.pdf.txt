Here , we report a synergy between shape - generating processes in the cell interior and the external organization and composition of the cell - surface glycocalyx . Mucin biopolymers and long - chain polysaccharides within the glycocalyx can generate entropic forces that favor or disfavor the projection of spherical and ﬁnger - like extensions from the cell surface . A polymer brush model of the glycocalyx successfully predicts the effects of poly - mer size and cell - surface density on membrane morphologies . Speciﬁc glycocalyx compositions can also induce plasma membrane instabilities to generate more exotic undulating and pearled mem - brane structures and drive secretion of extracellular vesicles . Together , our results suggest a funda - mental role for the glycocalyx in regulating curved membrane features that serve in communication be - tween cells and with the extracellular matrix . INTRODUCTION Tubular and spherical extensions of the plasma membrane play vital roles in human development and everyday cellular func - tions . Although curved membrane protrusions have long been recognized to increase cell - surface area for secretion , absorp - tion , and receptor - mediated communication , modern research has provided compelling examples of more diverse and sophis - ticated functionalities ( Marshall , 2012 ) . For instance , membrane projections are generated by embryonic cells to pinpoint delivery of morphogens at distant sites in developing tissues ( Bischoff et al . , 2013 ; Kornberg and Roy , 2014 ) and also by native and engineered immune cells for antigen surveillance ( D’Aloia et al . , 2018 ; Jung et al . , 2016 ) . Deregulation of membrane - shape - generating processes can contribute directly to disease pro - gression . Notably , aggressive tumor cells extend abundant membrane tubules for adhesion and long - range intercellular communication , project spherical blebs to generate friction for amoeboid migration , and generate spherical microvesicles at the plasma membrane for long - range delivery of cargoes ( Anto - nyak et al . , 2011 ; Becker et al . , 2016 ; Bergert et al . , 2015 ; Friedl and Wolf , 2010 ; Kramer and Nicolson , 1979 ; Liu et al . , 2018 ; Lou et al . , 2012 ) . Forces originating from cytoskeletal dynamics are posited to generate membrane curvature for the diverse spherical and tubular structures on the cell surface . Polymerizing cytoskeletal ﬁlaments are envisioned to push out at discrete points along the plasma membrane for extension of microvilli , cilia , ﬁlopodia , and other ﬁnger - like projections ( Footer et al . , 2007 ; Gupton and Gertler , 2007 ; Mogilner and Rubinstein , 2005 ; Peskin et al . , 1993 ) . Contraction of the cytoskeleton generates the hydrostatic pressure for spherical expansion of the membrane during bleb formation ( Charras et al . , 2005 ) . The physical dynamics that bend sub - regions of the plasma membrane into microvesicles remain poorly understood ; however , reports have implicated the actin cytoskeleton in their biogenesis ( Tricarico et al . , 2017 ) . Although the cell - surface glycocalyx is not featured in canon - ical models of membrane - shape regulation , correlations abound between glycocalyx composition and cell - surface morphology in both normal and disease states . Polypeptide and sugar co - poly - mers called mucins are frequently anchored at high densities on the surfaces of epithelial microvilli ( Hattrup and Gendler , 2008 ; Cell 177 , 1757 – 1770 , June 13 , 2019 ª 2019 Elsevier Inc . 1757 A B C D E F G H ( legend on next page ) 1758 Cell 177 , 1757 – 1770 , June 13 , 2019 Kesavan et al . , 2009 ; Kesimer et al . , 2013 ) , cilia ( Button et al . , 2012 ) , and ﬁlopodia ( Bennett et al . , 2001 ) . Hyaluronan polymers densely coat the microvilli of oocytes and mesothelium ( Evanko et al . , 2007 ; Makabe et al . , 2006 ) . Chains of sialic acid and hya - luronan decorate the highly curved surfaces of neuronal axons ( Fowke et al . , 2017 ; van den Pol and Kim , 1993 ; Zhang et al . , 1992 ) . T cells and dendritic cells exhibit coincident changes in membrane tubularization and mucin expression upon matura - tion ( Agrawal et al . , 1998 ; Cloosen et al . , 2004 ; Jung et al . , 2016 ; Pilon et al . , 2009 ) . Tumor cells frequently produce an abun - dance of mucins and hyaluronan on their cell surface ( Kufe , 2009 ; Turley et al . , 2016 ) , and the expression of these polymers has been linked to their unique membrane features , such as extensive microvilli ( Koistinen et al . , 2015 ; Polefka et al . , 1984 ) . Mucins and hyaluronan polymers are also densely arrayed on the surfaces of enterocytes , reactive astrocytes , dendritic cells , and tumor cells , and these cells commonly secrete high levels of vesicles ( Cloosen et al . , 2004 ; Gangoda et al . , 2015 ; McConnell et al . , 2009 ; Paszek et al . , 2014 ; Pelaseyed et al . , 2014 ; Tricarico et al . , 2017 ) . Although the ubiquity of these correlations suggests a possible causal relationship between glycocalyx polymer composition and plasma membrane morphologies , a speciﬁc mechanism of action has not been delineated . Mucins and long - chain polysaccharides are anchored to the membrane , such that long polymer chains or loops are expected to extend from the cell surface ( Hattrup and Gendler , 2008 ; Lee et al . , 1993 ) . The ensemble resembles a well - studied structure in polymer physics called a brush , where polymers are grafted on one end to a surface ( Chen et al . , 2017 ) . Polymer brush theory has long recognized that steric interactions in a densely crowded brush restrict the number of molecular conﬁgurations each poly - mer can explore , thereby increasing the free energy of the sys - tem through reduced entropy ( de Gennes , 1980 ) . Similar to the thermodynamic basis of gas pressure , the entropic penalty associated with molecular crowding can generate pressure on the anchoring surface ( Hiergeist and Lipowsky , 1996 ; Lipowsky , 1995 ; Stachowiak et al . , 2012 ) . Experimental studies with syn - thetic polymers have conﬁrmed that the pressures generated by these unstructured macromolecules are sufﬁcient to deform ﬂexible lipid membranes ( Busch et al . , 2015 ; Evans and Rawicz , 1997 ; Hansen et al . , 2003 ; Kenworthy et al . , 1995 ) . However , whether biopolymers in the glycocalyx might regulate plasma membrane morphologies through a similar mechanism remains largely untested . RESULTS Glycocalyx Polymers and Membrane Morphology Guided by the framework of polymer brush theory , we hypothe - sized that glycocalyx polymers may generate an entropic bending force to favor the formation of curved membrane struc - tures . As a corollary to this hypothesis , we envisioned that emer - gent membrane structures could be tuned through rational manipulation of the glycocalyx . To test these hypotheses , we evaluated a genetically encoded library of native , semi - synthetic , and rationally designed mucin polymers of varying size , backbone sequence , and membrane anchorage ( Figure 1A ) . Polymers considered included the 42 native tandem repeats ( TRs ) of Mucin - 1 ( Muc1 - 42TR ) , theserine - and threonine - rich polymer domain of Podocalyxin ( Podxl ; S / T - Rich ) , and a new synthetic mucin that we rationally designed based on a consensus mucin O - glycosylation sequence , PPASTSAPGA ( Rational ) ( Figure 1A ) . Each polymer domain was fused to the native Muc1 trans - membrane anchor with the cytoplasmic tail deleted ( D CT ) or the native mucin transmembrane anchor with a membrane - prox - imal green ﬂuorescent protein for imaging ( GFP - D CT ; Figure 1A ) . The cytoplasmic tails of the native membrane anchors were deleted to limit intracellular signal transduction by the mucins . We also created mucin chimeras with a synthetic 21 - amino - acid transmembrane domain ( TM21 ) to rule out that any observed effects of mucin expression could be attributed to the native mucin transmembrane domain and membrane - prox - imal sequences ( Figure 1A ) . Each mucin expressed well on the cell surface ( Figures S1A – S1C ) . The mucin polymer backbones were heavily glycosylated with O - linked sugar side chains to form the bottlebrush molecular structures that deﬁne mucins ( Figures S1B and S1C ) . When expressed at high levels on the epithelial cell surface , each of the long - chain mucins triggered a dramatic tubulariza - tion of the plasma membrane ( Figures 1B and 1C ) . The pheno - type was observed whether the mucin polymers were tethered to the membrane by a native - mucin transmembrane domain or synthetic membrane anchor ( Figures 1B and 1C ; compare Figure 1 .

All of the mucin polymer domains were expected to be unstructured due to their high proline con - tent and densely clustered serine and threonine sites for O - glycosylation . To test whether a more rigid , folded protein construct of comparable size to the mucins could induce a similar phenotype , we created a chimeric glycoprotein through fusion of the native Muc1 transmembrane anchor with repeating units of highly stable , epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) - like motifs from the ectodomain of human Notch1 ( Kovall et al . , 2017 ; Weis - shuhn et al . , 2016 ) . The expressed Notch1 chimera was similar in molecular weight to fully glycosylated Muc1 . However , the more rigid glycoprotein was largely ineffective at inducing membrane tubularization ( Figures 1B , 1C , and S1B ) . We conﬁrmed that the library of mucin constructs and chimeras were all expressed at similar levels on the cell surface , ruling out that the differences in membrane phenotype could be attributed to differential expression ( Figure S1C ) . We tested whether enzymatic digestion of the mucin - rich gly - cocalyx would destabilize the curved membrane features and revert tubularization . Glycans on live Muc1 - 42TR D CT - express - ing cells were labeled and imaged with single - molecule localiza - tion microscopy ( Mo¨ckl et al . , 2018 ) . The tubulated morphology of these cells was lost upon treatment with the speciﬁc mucin - backbone - digesting enzyme called secreted protease of C1 esterase inhibitor ( StcE ) from enterohemorrhagic E . coli ( Malaker et al . , 2018 ) ( Figure 1D ) . The rapid reversibility of the membrane morphologies fol - lowing mucin digestion argued against excess membrane surface area as the underlying mechanism through which gly - cocalyx biopolymers exert control over cell - surface shapes . As an additional control , we conducted a standard transferrin - receptor internalization assay to evaluate the effects of mucin expression on endocytosis and recycling , which are key mech - anisms of plasma - membrane area regulation in cells . We found that Muc1 expression did not have a signiﬁcant effect on trans - ferrin endocytosis ( Figures S1D and S1E ) . We also found that mucin glycocalyx biopolymers could induce spontaneous cur - vature in model membrane systems that lack the machinery for active regulation of surface area and surface tension . Notably , the S / T - rich polymer domain of Podxl triggered exten - sion of spherical and tubular membrane structures when anchored to the surface of giant unilamellar vesicles ( GUVs ) ( Figures 1E and S1F ) . The tubularization phenomenon observed in cells was rela - tively insensitive to the length of the mucin polymer domain , pro - vided that the polymers were expressed on the cell surface at moderate to high densities . Cell lines expressing mucins with 0 , 10 , and 42 Muc1 TRs were sorted into populations with similar mucin surface densities ( Figures 1F and S1G ) . Both 10 - and 42 - TR mucins induced signiﬁcantly more plasma - membrane tubules than the construct lacking the repeats ( Figures 1G and 1H ) . Comparison of cells with a similar spread area ruled out that effects associated with cell spreading could explain the morphological differences ( Figure 1G ) . Similar to our observations with mucins , we found that a glyco - calyx rich in large , linear polysaccharides could also trigger dramatic changes in plasma - membrane morphology . Notably , hyaluronic acid synthase 3 ( HAS3 ) expression increased the density of high - molecular - weight hyaluronic acid ( HA ) polymers on the cell surface and led to the protrusion of many ﬁnger - like membrane extensions ( Figures S1H – S1K ) , consistent with prior observations ( Koistinen et al . , 2015 ) . Together , these results sug - gested that diverse glycocalyx polymer types and sizes might in - ﬂuence cell morphological states . Mucin Expression Predicts Tumor Cell Morphologies Prior studies had found that the structural conformation of mucin biopolymers is largely determined by the initial a R - N - ace - tylgalactosamine ( GalNAc ) residues of the mucin O - glycans ( Coltart et al . , 2002 ) . To conﬁrm that more extended glycan structures were not required for membrane tubularization by mucins , we abrogated the extension of mucin O - glycan chains through CRISPR / Cas9 - mediated knockout of Core - 1 b 3 - T spe - ciﬁc molecular chaperone ( COSMC ) , which is required for elon - gation of the primary O - linked GalNAc monosaccharide into more complex Core O - glycans ( Figure 2A ) ( Stolfa et al . , 2016 ; Wang et al . , 2010 ) . We also targeted mucin sialylation through knockout of solute carrier family 35 member A1 ( SLC35A1 ) , which shuttles activated nucleotide sugars from the cytoplasm into the Golgi for sialic acid addition to glycans ( Figure 2A ) ( Rie - mersma et al . , 2015 ) . The expected glycan perturbations were conﬁrmed with ﬂow cytometry using the Vicia villosa lectin ( VVA ) to probe non - extended a R - GalNAc , peanut agglutinin ( PNA ) to probe Core - 1 glycans , and metabolic labelling with azide - functionalized sugars to detect sialic acid incorporation ( Figure 2A ) . Disruption of O - glycan extension or sialylation did not block the strong induction of cell - surface tubularization by the Muc1 polymer backbone , although the density of membrane tubes on the cell surface was somewhat reduced compared to wild - type cells expressing the mucin at similar levels ( Figures 2B and 2C ) . Our results suggested that plasma - membrane morphologies might be predicted simply by the quantity of mucins or other bio - polymers on the cell surface . We tested this possibility in carci - noma cell lines that are known to have abundant levels of Muc1 in their glycocalyx . In each tumor cell line tested—human breast cancer T47D , human breast cancer ZR - 75 - 1 , and human cervical HeLa—subpopulations were present that expressed endogenous Muc1 at comparable or higher levels than the ectopically expressed mucins evaluated earlier ( Figures 1B , 1C , and 2D ) . Cells sorted for high Muc1 expression displayed signiﬁcantly more tubules than cells expressing lower native levels of the mucins ( Figures 2E , 2F , and 2G ) .

Specialized Cells In Vivo Motivated by our observations in vitro , we considered whether glycocalyx polymers might play a role in shaping the morphology of specialized cell types in vivo . We elected to evaluate synovio - cytes , because these secretory cells are known to produce large quantities of HA for joint lubrication and , thus , are expected to display a high density of HA polymers on their surface . We iso - lated synovial tissues from equine carpus ( Figure 3A ) and found that primary synoviocytes expressing HAS3 were highly tubu - lated , but treatment with hyaluronidase ( HyA ) to degrade HA resulted in the rapid destabilization and disappearance of membrane tubules ( Figures 3B and 3C ) . We also evaluated syn - oviocyte morphology in tissues that were freshly extracted and brieﬂy cultured ex vivo ( < 1 h ) . The synoviocytes in native synovial tissue displayed an HA - rich head that appeared highly tubulated and protruded from the tissue matrix ( Figures 3D and 3E ) . Brief treatment of the tissue with HyA ex vivo resulted in a dramatic retraction of synoviocyte tubules , suggesting a role for the glyco - calyx in the maintenance of membrane projections in vivo ( Figure 3E ) . Polymer Brush Framework To develop a more comprehensive understanding of membrane - shape regulation by glycocalyx polymers , we considered whether the observed membrane shapes and their frequencies could be rationalized through the framework of polymer brush theory . We noted that two limiting regimes are classically described in polymer physics for end - grafted polymers : the ‘‘mushroom’’ regime , where polymers at low grafting densities have limited interactions with each other , and the ‘‘brush’’ regime , where crowded polymers can interact sterically and electrostatically with each other to exert larger pressures on the anchoring surface ( Milner , 1991 ) ( Figure 4A ) . For mucins , we expected the transition from the mushroom to brush regime to occur at a surface density where the average distance be - tween the polymers was approximately two times their radius of gyration in solution ( Figure 4A ) .

Size - exclusion chromatography coupled to multi - angle light scattering ( SEC - MALS ) reported 32 nm ± 0 . 4 % for the mucin radius of gyration in physiological buffer . Based on the estimated Muc1 - 42TR contour length of approxi - mately 270 nm , we concluded that the mucin had a persistence length of approximately 7 . 5 nm and adopted the extended random coil conﬁguration expected for a semi - ﬂexible polymer in solution . We next asked whether polymer brush theory could capture the physical behavior of mucin ensembles on the cell surface . We tested whether mucins stretch and extend in a predictable manner as they become progressively more crowded , a classic physical behavior predicted for polymer brushes ( Alexander , 1977 ; de Gennes , 1980 ; Milner , 1991 ) . We chose to evaluate mucin extension on actin - containing tubules that resembled microvilli , because the curvature of these structures was highly uniform and essentially independent of the mucin surface den - sity due to the rigid actin cores ( Figure S2C ) . As such , we could approximate the tubule surface as a rigid cylinder of ﬁxed radius for direct comparison to theory . Epitope tags ﬂanking the mucin polymer domain were introduced on Muc1 - 42TR . Following cellular expression , the encoded tags were labeled with ﬂuoro - phore - conjugated probes and resolved on microvilli cross - sec - tions using a super - resolution optical technique called expan - sion microscopy ( ExM ) ( Figures 4B and S2D – S2F ) . We found that the mucin extension had an exponential dependence , or ‘‘scaled , ’’ with ﬂuorescence intensity and , hence , surface den - sity , with an exponent of 0 . 48 ± 0 . 10 ( Figure 4B ) . This value compared well to the theoretically derived power law exponent of between 0 . 33 and 0 . 5 for polyelectrolytes grafted on a rigid cylindrical surface at physiological salt concentrations ( Zhulina and Borisov , 1996 ) . Encouraged by these ﬁndings , we created a polymer brush model to describe the physical behavior of a mucin - rich glycoca - lyx assembled on the plasma membrane ( see STAR Methods ) . In our model , entropic pressure from the mucin brush generated spontaneous membrane curvature that scaled strongly with polymer density and weakly with polymer chain length ( Hiergeist and Lipowsky , 1996 ) ( Figures 4C and S3 ) . The weak dependence on polymer length was consistent with our earlier ﬁndings that mucins with 10 and 42 repeats had comparable effects on cell - surface morphology despite their 4 - fold difference in size ( Fig - ures 1G , 1H , and S1G ) . For 10 and 42 TR mucins , our brush model predicted only a (cid:1) 20 % difference in spontaneous mem - brane curvature ( Figure S3 ) . Preferred Membrane Shapes We tested whether the polymer model could explain the fre - quency of ﬁnger - like and spherical protrusions from the cell A C D B Figure 4 .

We reasoned that protrusion of a speciﬁc membrane feature would be disfavored when high intracellular forces were required to extend or maintain the protrusion and favored when these force requirements were minimal . Minimizing the standard Helfrich free - energy function for membranes with induced spontaneous curvature , we calculated the equilibrium cytosolic pressure required to maintain a spherical membrane bleb and the point force required to maintain a membrane tubule ( Dere´nyi et al . , 2002 ) ( Figure 4D ; see STAR Methods ) . For experimental comparison , we evaluated the types , sizes , and frequencies of plasma - membrane features as a function of mucin cell - surface density . Cells expressing Muc1 - 42TR GFP D CT were labeled with an anti - GFP nanobody and sorted into populations of varying mucin surface levels ( Figures 5A and 5B ) . The average mucin surface density in each population was estimated by SDS - PAGE through interpolation using a nanobody standard curve ( Figure S4 ) . Molecular surface densities in the sorted populations ranged from approximately 180 to 50 , 000 mucins per m m 2 . For reference , we expected the mushroom - to - brush transition to occur around 250 mucins per m m 2 based on the measured radius of gyration of recombi - nant Muc1 - 42TR in solution . Initially , we evaluated membrane blebs . Using physical pa - rameters measured for Muc1 - 42TR , we predicted that the pres - sure required for maintaining a bleb with a typical radius of 250 nm would be minimal at moderate mucin densities near the mushroom - brush transition ( Figures 5C and 5D ) . An impor - tant model prediction was that the required maintenance pressure would rise sharply at higher mucin densities , quickly reaching pressures that exceed the known limits of the cell’s contractile machinery ( Charras et al . , 2008 ) . Thus , theory sug - gested that blebbing would be supported by low mucin densities and suppressed by a highly dense glycocalyx ( Figure 4D ) . Our experimental observations showed good qualitative agreement with these predictions . Cells with a mucin density near the estimated mushroom - brush transition displayed a signiﬁcant number of large , bleb - like forms with an average radius of 260 ± 100 nm ( Figures 5B – 5D ; 180 mucins per m m 2 ) .

The glycocalyx polymer model predicted a much different dependence of membrane tubule extension on mucin density . The predicted point force required for maintaining an extended tubule decreased progressively with high mucin densities and exhibited no sharp transitions ( Figure 4D ) . Accordingly , the fre - quency of cell - surface tubules observed in our sorted cell popu - lations increased steadily with mucin density throughout the mushroom and brush regimes until the cell was fully saturated with tubes at very high mucin densities ( Figures 5B – 5E ) . Notably , theory predicted that at these high densities , the required force for tubule extension is comparable to the polymerization force of a single cytoskeletal ﬁlament , (cid:1) 1 pN ( Footer et al . , 2007 ) . Based on the experimentally measured mucin densities , we esti - mated the theoretical point force , f , required to maintain tubules . Remarkably , the experimentally observed tube frequency on our sorted cell populations had a nearly perfect inverse correla - tion with the theoretical point force calculated for the corre - sponding mucin density ( Figure 5F ) . The Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient describing the relationship between tube density and 1 / f was 0 . 97 . Membrane Instabilities and Microvesicle Generation We next considered whether other functional membrane shapes could be generated through actions of the glycocalyx . We noted that the tubular membrane projections on our cells typically con - tained a ﬁlamentous actin ( F - actin ) core and did not contain mi - crotubules ( Figures 6A , 6B , and S5A – S5D ) . Disruption of F - actin assembly with the drug Latrunculin A ( LatA ) led to a reduction in tubule diameter by approximately 30 nm ( Figures 6C , 6D , S5E , and S5F ) , indicating that the mucin - induced spontaneous curva - ture exceeded the curvature of the stable , actin - ﬁlled projec - tions . Notably , LatA treatment triggered the formation of pearled and undulating structures that characteristically arise through membrane instabilities ( Bar - Ziv et al . , 1999 ) ( Figure 6D ) . Deuling , Helfrich , and others theoretically considered instabil - ities in membrane tubules with volume to area ratio , l , and found that for certain spontaneous curvatures , c 0 , the membrane bending energy vanished through the adoption of one of three ‘‘Delaunay’’ shapes : a cylinder for c 0 = 1 / 2 l ( Shape 1 ) , a smoothly varying set of unduloids for 1 / 2 l < c 0 < 2 / 3 l ( Shape 2 ) , and a set of equal - sized ‘‘pearls’’ for c 0 = 2 / 3 l ( Shape 3 ) ( Cam - pelo and Herna´ndez - Machado , 2007 ; Tsafrir et al . , 2001 ) . For spontaneous curvatures that exceeded 2 / 3 l , the lowest energy shapes that satisﬁed the constraints of volume and surface area were found to include a set of small pearls of the preferred curvature with one or more big pearls necessary to hold excess volume ( Shape 4 ) or a set of pearls with a gradient in size ( Shape 5 ) ( Campelo and Herna´ndez - Machado , 2007 ; Tsafrir et al . , 2001 ) . We evaluated whether the minimal energy surfaces , Shapes 1 to 5 , would be formed on cells expressing moderate to high levels of mucin without exogenous treatments and found commonplace examples of each expected minimal energy shape ( Figure 6E ) . The pearled structures were not observed in control cells that did not express high levels of mucin . Previous theoretical and experimental studies indicated that the thin membrane necks connecting pearled membrane struc - tures , such as those observed on our cells , would be expected to undergo spontaneous ﬁssure due to the high elastic stress accumulated in the constricted necks ( Kozlovsky and Kozlov , 2003 ; Morlot et al . , 2012 ; Snead et al . , 2017 ) . Therefore , we hy - pothesized that microvesicles would be released as a conse - quence of the mucin - induced membrane instabilities ( Figure 6F ) . We found that the conditioned media from Muc1 - 42TR - express - ing cells contained massive concentrations of particles ranging in size from approximately 100 nm to 400 nm ( Figure 6G ) . Particle generation was further enhanced by LatA treatments that disrup - ted the supporting F - actin cores of surface projections ( Figures 6H and S5F ) . Cryo - transmission electron microscopy ( cryo - TEM ) conﬁrmed that the secreted particles were membrane ves - icles grafted with a distinct glycocalyx ultrastructure on their sur - faces ( Figure 6I ) . The removal of the glycocalyx , such as by HyA treatment to remove HA from the cell surface of HAS3 - express - ing cells , signiﬁcantly reduced vesicle production ( Figure 6J ) . Highnumbersofmicrovesiclegenerationhavebeenreportedin many cancer - cell types ( Menck et al . , 2017 ; Muralidharan - Chari et al . , 2010 ) . We tested whether high mucin expression , which is common in tumor cells , might at least partially explain why these cells have a propensity to generate microvesicles . We found that HeLa tumor - cell subpopulations sorted for high endogenous Muc1 expression produced signiﬁcantly more vesicles than cell populations with low endogenous Muc1 levels ( Figure 6K ) . Together , our results suggested a possible sequence for mi - crovesicle generation : ( 1 ) the glycocalyx enables cytoskeletal ﬁl - aments to extend and stabilize thin protrusions from the plasma membrane , and ( 2 ) after disassembly of the cytoskeletal core , spontaneous curvature imposed by the glycocalyx induces for - mation of membrane pearls that spontaneously ﬁssure to release vesicles ( Figures 6E and 6F ) . DISCUSSION Overall , the theories and experiments presented here implicate an entropic mechanism through which the glycocalyx can strongly inﬂuence the favorability of diverse plasma membrane shapes and protrusions . The morphological changes regulated by the glycocalyx could , in principle , have broad consequences on membrane processes , ranging from absorption and secretion to cellular communication , signaling , and motility ( Lange , 2011 ; Paluch and Raz , 2013 ; Sauvanet et al . , 2015 ; Schmick and Bas - tiaens , 2014 ) . Given that glycosylation often changes dramati - cally with cell - fate transitions ( Buck et al . , 1971 ; Freeze , 2013 ; Satomaa et al . , 2009 ) and that the pool of monomers for con - struction of glycoproteins and glycosaminoglycans in the glyco - calyx is tightly coupled to speciﬁc metabolic programs ( Dennis et al . , 2009 ; Koistinen et al . , 2015 ; Ying et al . , 2012 ) , our work rai - ses the intriguing possibility that the glycocalyx may serve as a conduit linking physical morphology to speciﬁc cell states . Contemporary frameworks for understanding membrane - shape regulation largely lack a physical description of the glyco - calyx . However , long - chain biopolymers in the glycocalyx are almost universally found anchored to the surfaces of curved membrane features and cell - surface organelles ( Bennett et al . , 2001 ; Button et al . , 2012 ; Fowke et al . , 2017 ; Hattrup and Gen - dler , 2008 ; Kesavan et al . , 2009 ; Kesimer et al . , 2013 ; Makabe Cell 177 , 1757 – 1770 , June 13 , 2019 1765 A B C D E F G H I J K Figure 6 .

Our results suggest that the principles and theories of polymer phys - ics can be adopted to understand , at least to a ﬁrst approxima - tion , the physical regulation of membrane - shape generation by the glycocalyx . Undoubtedly , a model of end - anchored polymer mushrooms and polymer brushes is a simple physical represen - tation of the glycocalyx . However , the inverse relationship between the force requirements for membrane extension , as estimated using a relatively simple model of the glycocalyx , and the experimentally observed frequencies of these exten - sions argue that at least some of the physical behaviors of the glycocalyx can be captured using well - established polymer models ( de Gennes , 1979 ; Zhulina and Borisov , 1996 ) . Our model and analyses assume constant membrane tension , leading to the prediction that the lengths of tubular projections are invariant of force . In reality , cells have a ﬁnite reservoir of membrane ( Raucher and Sheetz , 1999 ) . Increasing membrane tension after depletion of reservoirs would ultimately limit the length of tubular forms projected from the membrane ( Cuvelier et al . , 2005 ; Raucher and Sheetz , 1999 ) . Transport limitations of cytoskeletal monomers also likely place an important constraint limiting the overall length of long and thin membrane projections ( Mogilner and Rubinstein , 2005 ) . Indeed , we only report a weak dependence of tubule length on glycocalyx poly - mer density ( Figure 5B ) . Bending of surfaces by anchored polymers is a general phys - ical phenomenon ( Busch et al . , 2015 ; Evans and Rawicz , 1997 ; Hansen et al . , 2003 ; Hiergeist and Lipowsky , 1996 ; Kenworthy et al . , 1995 ; Lipowsky , 1995 ; Stachowiak et al . , 2012 ) . As such , membrane - shape regulation by the glycocalyx could be a uni - versal feature in the biogenesis of curved membrane organelles and signaling structures . For instance , cilia , axons , cytonemes , tunneling nanotubes , microvilli , and microvesicles could all conceivably be regulated by physical forces related to the glyco - calyx . Thus , our work argues for a more holistic model of mem - brane - shape regulation that includes consideration of forces on both the intracellular and extracellular faces of the plasma membrane .

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS Cell Lines Parental Cell Lines MCF10A cells were cultured in DMEM / F12 media supplemented with 5 % horse serum , 20 ng / mL EGF , 10 m g / ml insulin , 500 ng / mL hydrocortisone , 100 ng / mL cholera toxin and penicillin / streptomycin . HEK293T and HeLa cells were cultured in DMEM high glucose media supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine serum and penicillin / streptomycin . T47D cells were cultured in RPMI media supple - mented with 10 % fetal bovine serum , 10 m g / ml insulin , and penicillin / streptomycin . FreeStyle 293 - F cells were maintained in Free - style 293 Expression Medium in spinner ﬂasks at 37 (cid:4) C , 8 % CO 2 , 120 RPM , and 80 % RH according to manufacturer’s protocol . Generated Cell Lines Stable MCF10A , primary equine synoviocyte , and 293 - F cells expressing the rtTA - M2 tetracycline transactivator were prepared by lentiviral transduction using the pLV rtTA - NeoR plasmid as previously described ( Paszek et al . , 2012 ) . Cells were further modiﬁed with tetracycline - responsive promoter plasmids . Stable cells expressing hyaluronan synthase 3 ( HAS3 ) were prepared by lentiviral trans - duction using the pLV HygroR tetOn HAS3 plasmid . For preparation of the mucin - expressing cell lines and Notch1 - expressing cell line ( EGF - repeats GFP D CT ) , plasmids with ITR - ﬂanked expression cassettes ( i . e . pPB tetOn PuroR plasmids ) were co - transfected with the PiggyBac hyperactive transposase using Nucleofection Kit V ( Lonza ) or FreeStyle Max Reagent ( Thermo Fisher ) according to manufacturer’s protocols . For CRISPR knockouts , cell lines expressing Muc1 - 42TR D CT were further modiﬁed by lentiviral transduc - tion using either SLC35A1 lentiCRISPR v2 GFP or COSMC lentiCRISPR v2 Blast plasmids . Selection of stable cell lines was per - formed with 750 m g / mL G418 , 1 m g / mL puromycin , 200 m g / mL hygromycin , or 15 m g / ml Blasticidin . Primary Synoviocyte Isolation and Culture Primary equine synoviocytes were obtained from the shoulder , stiﬂe , carpal , tarsal , and fetlock joints of a male thoroughbred yearling horse ( Equus caballus ) . To isolate the ﬁbroblast - like type B synovial cells ( synoviocytes ) , synovial membrane tissues were digested with 0 . 15 % collagenase ( Worthington Biochemical , Lakewood , NJ ) supplemented with 0 . 015 % DNase I ( Roche , Indianapolis , IN ) for 3 h at 37 (cid:4) C in Ham’s F12 media , followed by ﬁltration and centrifugation at 250x g for 10 min as previously described ( Saxer et al . , 2001 ) . Equine synoviocytes were cultured in low glucose ( 1 . 0 g / L ) DMEM media supplemented with 40 mM HEPES , 4 mM L - Gluta - mine , 110 mg / L sodium pyruvate , 10 % fetal bovine serum and penicillin / streptomycin . Subculture of the synoviocytes was per - formed every 3 ‒ 4 days . All adherent cells were maintained at 37 (cid:4) C , 5 % CO 2 , and 90 % RH . Equine Synovial Tissue Resection Synovial tissues were harvested from the middle carpal joint of two adult thoroughbred horses . The freshly resected tissues were either incubated for 30 min in Ham’s F12 media with or without 1 U / mL Hyaluronidase ( Sigma ) and ﬁxed or immediately ﬁxed for 24 h with 4 % paraformaldehyde and 1 % glutaraldehyde in PBS . Tissues were then either processed for SEM or reduced with 0 . 1 mg / mL NaBH 4 for 20 min on ice and further processed for confocal imaging . METHOD DETAILS Cloning and Constructs cDNAs for cytoplasmic - tail - deleted human Muc1 with 42 tandem repeats ( Muc1 - 42TR D CT ) , Muc1 - 42TR polymer domain fusion with the TM21 synthetic membrane domain ( Muc1 - 42TR TM21 ) , cytoplasmic - tail - deleted human Podocalyxin ( S / T - Rich D CT ) Continued REAGENT or RESOURCE SOURCE IDENTIFIER Fiji NIH https : / / ﬁji . sc / Matlab 2015b MathWorks https : / / www . mathworks . com / help / matlab / release - notes - R2015b . html Adobe Photoshop CC Adobe https : / / www . adobe . com / products / photoshop . html Adobe Illustrator CC Adobe https : / / www . adobe . com / products / illustrator . html Cell 177 , 1757 – 1770 . e1 – e13 , June 13 , 2019 e5 were generated and cloned into the tetracycline - inducible PiggyBac expression vector ( pPB tetOn PuroR ) or mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 . 1 as previously described ( Paszek et al . , 2014 ; Shurer et al . , 2017 ) . To make lentiviral vector pLV HygroR tetOn HAS3 , the cDNA for human HAS3 ( accession NP _ 005320 ) was obtained from R & D Systems and ampliﬁed via PCR with the forward primer , 5 0 - GGCACCTCGAGGATGCCGGTGCAGCTGACGACA - 3 0 , and reverse primer , 5 0 - GGCAGAATTCTTACACCTCAGCAAAAGCC AAGCT - 3 0 . The PCR product was cloned into pJET1 . 2 ( ThermoFisher ) according to manufacturer’s protocol , and subcloned into the AbsI and EcoRI sites of pLV HygroR tetOn ( Paszek et al . , 2012 ) . For generation of Muc1 GFP D CT pPB tetOn PuroR with varying number of tandem repeats , the cDNA for mOxGFP ( Addgene # 68070 ; heretofore mOxGFP is referred to as GFP ) was ampliﬁed with primers : 5 0 - GGCAGCTCAGCTATGGTGTCCAAGGGCGAGGAGCTGT - 3 0 ( forward ) and 5 0 - GGCAGCTGAGCCCTTATACAG CTCGTCCATGCCGTGAGT - 3 0 ( reverse ) . The PCR product was cloned into pJET1 . 2 and subcloned non - directionally into the BlpI site of Muc1 - 42TR D CT pPB tetOn PuroR . For constructs with 10 and 42 native tandem repeats ( PDTRPAPGSTAPPAHGVTSA ) , syn - thetic cDNAs for the desired repeat units were generated through custom gene synthesis ( General Biosystems ) and cloned in place of the tandem repeats in Muc1 GFP D CT pPB tetOn PuroR using the BamHI and Bsu36I restriction sites . Muc1 tandem repeats were deleted through Q5 site directed mutagenesis with 5 0 - TGGAGGAGCCTCAGGCATACTTTATTG - 3 0 ( forward ) and 5 0 - CCACCGCC GACCGAGGTGACATCCTG - 3 0 ( reverse ) primers to generate Muc1 0TR GFP D CT pPB tetOn PuroR . To add a SumoStar tag to the Muc1 - 42TR GFP D CT N terminus , a cDNA encoding the IgG kappa leader sequence , SumoStar tag , and Muc1 N terminus was generated through custom gene synthesis ( General Biosystems ) and inserted in place of the Muc1 N terminus in Muc1 GFP D CT pPB tetOn PuroR using the BamHI and BsrGI restriction sites . For construction of both COSMC and SLC35A1 vectors , we used the pLentiCRISPRv2 system . The target sequence for human COSMC ( 5 0 - GAGTCTTTGGGCTGCAGTAA - 3 0 ) was cloned into the pLentiCRISPRv2 Blast backbone ( Addgene # 83480 ) . The target sequence for human SLC35A1 ( 5 0 - TTCTGTGATACACAC GGCTG - 3 0 ) was cloned into the pLentiCRISPRv2 GFP backbone ( Addgene # 82416 ) , both after BsmBI digestion . For generation of the Notch1 GFP D CT pPB tetOn PuroR plasmid ( EGF - repeats GFP D CT ) , the cDNA for Notch1 ( Addgene # 41728 ) was ampliﬁed with primers : 5 0 - GGCAAGATCTCTAGAGGCTTGAGATGCTCCCAGCCA - 3 0 ( forward ) and 5 0 - GGCACCTGAGG CGTGGCACAGTAGCCCGTTGAATTTG - 3 0 ( reverse ) . The PCR product was cloned into the BglII and Bsu36I sites of the Muc1 42TR D CT pPB tetOn PuroR plasmid . For recombinant production of the mucin polymer domain , 42 tandem repeats from Muc1 were fused to an N - terminal S6 tag ( GDSLSWLLRLLN ) and C - terminal 10x - histidine puriﬁcation tag to make Muc1 - 42TR 10X His . To insert the S6 tag , Q5 site directed mutagenesis was performed using 5 0 - GTTGCGACTGCTTAACGGACAGATCTCGATGGTGAGC - 3 0 ( forward ) and 5 0 - AGCCAGCT CAGGGAATCCCCAGCATTCTTCTCAGTAGAG - 3 0 ( reverse ) on a pcDNA3 . 1 plasmid containing the Muc1 N terminus from Muc1 - 42TR D CT pPB tetOn PuroR between BamHI and BglII sites . The S6 tag was subsequently cut at these sites and replaced in the Muc1 - 42TR D CT N terminus in Muc1 - 42TR D CT pPB tetOn PuroR . The 10x - histidine tag was added by annealing the oligos , 5 0 - TCAGGCCACCACCACCATCACCATCATCACCACCATTAGGG - 3 0 and 3 0 - CCGGTGGTGGTGGTAGTGGTAGTAGTGGTGGTAA TCCCTTAA - 5 0 and inserting in place of the Muc1 - 42TR D CT C terminus in Muc1 - 42TR D CT pPB tetOn PuroR using the Bsu36I and EcoRI restriction sites . Immuno - and Lectin Blot Analysis Cells were plated at 20 , 000 cells / cm 2 and induced with 0 . 2 m g / mL doxycycline ( Santa Cruz ) for 24 h before lysis with Tris - Triton lysis buffer ( Abcam ) . Lysates were separated on Nupage 4 % – 12 % Bis - Tris or 3 % – 8 % Tris - Acetate gels ( Thermo Fisher ) and transferred to PVDF membranes . Primary antibodies were diluted 1 : 1000 and lectins were diluted to 1 m g / mL in 3 % BSA TBST and incubated 4 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 (cid:4) C . Secondary antibodies or ExtrAvidin were diluted 1 : 2000 in 3 % BSA TBST and incubated for 2 h at room temperature . Blots were developed in Clarity ECL ( BioRad ) substrate , imaged on a ChemiDoc ( BioRad ) documentation system , and quantiﬁed in ImageJ Fiji ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) . Flow Cytometric Analysis Cells were plated at 20 , 000 cells / cm 2 and grown for 24 h . Cells were then induced with 0 . 2 m g / mL doxycycline ( Santa Cruz ) for 24 h . For sialic acid labeling by ManNAz , separate cultures were plated in parallel with cells treated for 24 h with both 0 . 2 m g / mL doxycy - cline ( Santa Cruz ) and 25 m M Ac 4 ManNAz ( Click Chemistry Tools ) . Ac 4 ManNAz treated cells were labeled with 50 m M AF647 DBCO in 1 % FBS PBS for 20min at room temperature . Adherent cells were non - enzymatically detached by incubating with 1 mM EGTA in PBS at 37 (cid:4) C for 20 min and added to the population of ﬂoating cells , if present . Afﬁnity reagents : anti - Muc1 , GFP nanobody , 650 Neutra - vidin were diluted 1 : 200 in 0 . 5 % BSA PBS ; 647 PNA and biotin VVA were diluted to 1 m g / mL in 0 . 5 % BSA PBS and incubated with cells at 4 (cid:4) C for 30 min for each stain . A BD Accuri C6 ﬂow cytometer was used for analysis . Confocal Microscopy for Cells and Tissues Cells were plated at 5 , 000 cells / cm 2 and subsequently induced with 0 . 2 m g / mL of doxycycline ( Santa Cruz ) for 24 h before being ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde . Antibodies and HABP were diluted 1 : 200 in 5 % normal goat serum ( Vector Laboratories ) in PBS and incubated overnight at 4 (cid:4) C . For ﬂuorescent HABP , HABP ( Millipore Sigma ) was labeled with Alexa Fluor 568 NHS Ester ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) per the manufacturer’s protocol . Lectins were diluted to 1 m g / mL in 5 % normal goat serum in PBS and incubated for 2 h at room temperature . For hyaluronic acid staining of cells and tissues , HABP was diluted to 0 . 125 m g / ml in 0 . 5 % normal goat serum in PBS and incubated on samples for 24 h . Cell samples were imaged on a Zeiss LSM inverted 880 confocal microscope using e6 Cell 177 , 1757 – 1770 . e1 – e13 , June 13 , 2019 a 40 3 water immersion objective ( NA 1 . 1 ) . In addition to HABP , NaBH 4 - treated tissues were stained with 1 m g / mL Hoechst for 10 min and imaged on a Zeiss 880 upright confocal microscope with a 40x water dipping lens . Unstained tissue collagen was visualized with second harmonic generation using non - descan detectors . Scanning Electron Microscopy All samples were ﬁxed for 24 h with 4 % paraformaldehyde and 1 % glutaraldehyde in PBS , post - ﬁxed for 45 min with 1 % osmium tetraoxide in dH 2 O , washed and subsequently dehydrated stepwise in ethanol of 25 % , 50 % , 70 % , 95 % , 100 % , 100 % before drying in a critical point dryer ( CPD 030 , Bal - Tec ) . Samples were coated with gold - palladium in a Desk V sputter system ( Denton Vacuum ) and imaged on a ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscope ( Mira3 FE - SEM , Tescan or FE - SEM LEO 1550 , Carl Zeiss ) . For actin depolymerization studies , cells were treated for 60 min with 10 m M LatA ( Cayman Chemical ) before ﬁxation , where indicated . Mucin Digestion and Super - Resolution Imaging Sample prep and azido sugars incorporation MCF10A Muc1 - 42TR D CT cells were cultured in phenol red free 1 : 1 DMEM : F12 supplemented as described previously . For imaging , cells were seeded at a density of 10 , 000 cells / well on Lab - Tek II Chambered Coverglass ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) coated with 0 . 01 % poly - Lysine ( Sigma ) . Media was supplemented with Ac 4 GalNAz ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) 2 h post - seeding at a concentration of 50 m M . For induction of Muc1 - 42TR D CT expression , doxycycline ( Applichem ) was added to Lab - Tek wells 16 h post - seeding at 200 ng / mL . Enzymatic de - mucination was performed 24 h post - doxycycline induction with 50 nM StcE in complete media for 2 h at 37 (cid:4) C immediately before labeling and imaging ( Malaker et al . , 2018 ; Mo¨ckl et al . , 2018 ) . Cu - click Labeling of GalNAc Cells were moved to 4 (cid:4) C and washed three times with cold DPBS with Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + . Immediately after washing , Cu - click conju - gation with AlexaFluor - 647 - alkyne ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) was performed . The cells were incubated with 50 m M CuSO 4 ( Sigma ) , 250 m M BTTAA ( Click Chemistry Tools ) , 1 mM aminoguanidine ( Sigma ) , 2 . 5 mM sodium ascorbate ( Sigma ) , and 25 m M AlexaFluor - 647 - alkyne ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) in DPBS for 5 min at 4 (cid:4) C as reported previously ( Hong et al . , 2010 ) . Cells were washed ﬁve times with cold DPBS and ﬁxed with 4 % paraformaldehyde ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) and 0 . 2 % glutaraldehyde ( Sigma ) in DPBS for 30 min at room temperature . Periodate - Mediated Labeling of Sialic Acids Sialic acids were labeled as described previously ( Zeng et al . , 2009 ) . Cells were moved to 4 (cid:4) C , then washed three times with cold DPBS with Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + followed by a 5 - minute incubation with 1 mM sodium periodate ( Sigma ) in DPBS . The periodate was quenched by 1 mM glycerol in cold DPBS and washed three times with cold DPBS . Samples were stained with 25 m M AlexaFluor - 647 - hydroxylamine ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) in the presence of 10 mM aniline in sterile ﬁltered DPBS + 5 % FBS pH 6 . 7 for 30 min at 4 (cid:4) C in the dark with gentle agitation . Cells were washed ﬁve times with cold DPBS and ﬁxed with 4 % paraformal - dehyde ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) and 0 . 2 % glutaraldehyde ( Sigma ) in DPBS for 30 min at room temperature . Optical Setup The core of the setup was an inverted microscope ( IX71 , Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) . The laser used for illumination ( 120 mW 647 nm , CW , Coherent , Santa Clara , CA ) was spectrally ﬁltered ( ff01 - 631 / 36 - 25 excitation ﬁlter , Semrock , Rochester , NY ) and circularly polar - ized ( LPVISB050 - MP2 polarizers , Thorlabs , Newton , NJ , WPQ05M - 633 quarter - wave plate , Thorlabs ) . The beam was expanded and collimated using Keplerian telescopes . Shutters were used to toggle the lasers ( VS14S2T1 with VMM - D3 three - channel driver , Vin - cent Associates Uniblitz , Rochester , NY ) . The laser was introduced into the back port of the microscope via a Ko¨hler lens . The sample was mounted onto an XYZ stage ( PInano XYZ Piezo Stage and High Precision XY Microscope Stage , Physik Instrument , Karlsruhe , Germany ) . Emitted light was detected by a high NA detection objective ( UPLSAPO100XO , x100 , NA 1 . 4 , Olympus ) and spectrally ﬁltered ( Di01 - R405 / 488 / 561 / 635 dichroic , Semrock , ZET647NF notch ﬁlter , Chroma , Bellows Falls , VT , ET700 / 75m . Image Acquisition and Analysis for SR Microscopy For single - molecule localization microscopy , a reducing , oxygen scavenging buffer ( Halpern et al . , 2015 ) consisting of 20 mM cyste - amine , 2 m L / mL catalase , 560 m g / mL glucose oxidase ( all Sigma - Aldrich ) , 10 % ( w / v ) glucose ( BD Difco , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) , and 100 mM Tris - HCl ( Life Technologies ) was added . Image acquisition was started after a short delay needed to convert the majority of the ﬂuorophores into a dark state at a laser intensity of 5 kW / cm 2 . The exposure time was 50 ms and the calibrated EM gain was 186 . SR images were reconstructed from approximately 40 , 000 frames using the ImageJ plugin Thunderstorm ( Ovesny´ et al . , 2014 ) . The frames were ﬁltered with a B - spline ﬁlter of order 3 and scale 2 . 0 . Single - molecule signals were detected with 8 - neighbor - hood connectivity and a threshold of three times the standard deviation of the ﬁrst wavelet level . Detected local maxima were ﬁtted with a 2D - Gaussian using least squares . Post - processing involved drift correction by cross - correlation , followed by ﬁltering ( settings : sigma of the ﬁtted Gaussian < 200 nm ; uncertainty of localization < 20 nm ) . Images were reconstructed as 2D histograms with bin size = 32 nm . Giant Unilamellar Vesicles Giant Unilamellar Vesicles ( GUVs ) were prepared by electroformation as described previously ( Angelova and Dimitrov , 1986 ) . Brieﬂy , lipids and dye dissolved in chloroform were spread on glass slides coated with ITO ( Indium - Tin - Oxide ) . The slides were placed under vacuum for 2 h to remove all traces of organic solvents . The lipid ﬁlms were hydrated and swelled in 120 mM sucrose at 55 (cid:4) C . GUVs Cell 177 , 1757 – 1770 . e1 – e13 , June 13 , 2019 e7 were electroformed by the application of an oscillating potential of 1 . 4 V ( peak - to - peak ) and 12 Hz for 3 h ( Busch et al . , 2015 ) . GUVs compositions were prepared with DOPC and increasing molar fractions of DOGS - Ni - NTA lipid ( 5 , 10 , 15 , and 20 mol % ) . Bodipy - PC was used to label the lipids at a dye / lipid ratio of 1 / 2500 . Recombinant His - tagged Podocalyxin was conjugated with Alexa Fluor 568 NHS Ester ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) , and the degree of labelling quantiﬁed according to the manufacturer’s protocol . GUVs were diluted in 20 mM HEPES , 50 mM NaCl , pH = 7 . 4 ( 120 mOsm ) and then mixed with labeled Podocalyxin ( (cid:1) 2 m M ) for at least 20 min before imaging ( GUVs / proteins = 1 / 1 by volume ) . GUVs were imaged on a Nikon C2plus confocal microscope using a 60x water immersion objective ( NA 1 . 2 ) . Lipids ( Bodipy - PC ) and protein ( Alexa Fluor 568 ) were imaged through excitation at wavelength l = 488 and 561 nm , respectively . Endocytosis Assay Human apo - Transferrin ( Sigma ) was diluted to 1 mg / mL in PBS and labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 NHS Ester ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc ) per manufacturer’s protocol .

Blots were developed in ECL substrate ( Amresco ) , imaged on a ChemiDoc ( BioRad ) documen - tation system , and quantiﬁed in ImageJ Fiji ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) . Cancer Cell Line Sorting MCF10A wild - type ( Control ) or Muc1 - 42TR D CT - expressing cells and cancer cell lines ( T47D , ZR - 75 - 1 , HeLa ) were plated at 10 , 000 cell / cm 2 overnight . MCF10A cells were induced with 0 . 2 m g / mL doxycycline ( Santa Cruz ) for 24 h . Cell lines were non - enzymatically detached using 1 mM EDTA in PBS . Detached cells were washed with 0 . 5 % BSA in PBS . For each cell line , FITC - conjugated anti - Muc1 antibody was diluted 1 : 500 per million cells and incubated with cells on ice for 30 min . Cells were washed with 0 . 5 % BSA in PBS three time before sorting . Cells were sorted with a BD FACS Aria II onto poly - l - lysine treated 8 mm coverslips at 2 , 000 to 5 , 000 cells / cm 2 for SEM , allowed to adhere for 4 h at 37 (cid:4) C , and ﬁxed for SEM imaging . Analysis of Mucin Radius of Gyration The Muc1 polymer domain with 42 tandem repeats ( S6 Muc1 - 42TR 10xHis ) was produced recombinantly in suspension adapted Freestyle 293 - F cells . Stable Freestyle 293 - F cell lines were prepared with the Muc1 - 42TR 10xHis pPB tetOn PuroR as described above . Production of Muc1 biopolymer was induced with 1 m g / mL doxycycline ( Santa Cruz ) in 30 mL of suspension culture in Freestyle 293 - F media . Induced media was collected after 24 h and puriﬁed on HisPur Ni - NTA resin ( Thermo Fisher ) according to standard protocols . Brieﬂy , 1 mL bed volume of Ni - NTA resin was rinsed with equilibration buffer ( 20 mM sodium phosphate , 0 . 5 M NaCl , pH = 7 . 4 ) . Equilibrated resin was incubated overnight at 4 (cid:4) C with 10 mL harvested Freestyle 293 - F media diluted in 30 mL of equilibration buffer . Beads were washed in equilibration buffer with 5 mM imidazole and eluted in equilibration buffer with 500 mM imidazole . Eluted protein was dialyzed against PBS and analyzed by SDS - PAGE . Gels were stained with SYPRO Ruby Protein Gel Stain ( Thermo Fisher ) according to manufacturer’s instructions to conﬁrm protein size and purity . Gels were blotted and probed with Muc1 and His antibodies to conﬁrm mucin identity and PNA lectin to conﬁrm mucin O - glycosylation . Puriﬁed recom - binant Muc1 was dialyzed against PBS to remove imidazole . The radius of gyration of the recombinant Muc1 polymer domain was measured with size - exclusion chromatography - coupled to multiangle light scattering ( SEC - MALS ) . Puriﬁed protein ( 40 m L of Muc1 with a concentration of 5 m g / m L ) was subjected to SEC using a Superdex 200 Increase 10 / 300 column ( GE Healthcare ) equilibrated in MALS buffer ( 20 mM sodium phosphate , 0 . 5 M NaCl , pH 7 . 4 ) . The SEC was coupled to a static 18 - angle light scattering detector ( DAWN HELEOS - II ) and a refractive index detector ( Optilab T - rEX , e8 Cell 177 , 1757 – 1770 . e1 – e13 , June 13 , 2019 Wyatt Technology ) . Data were collected every second at a ﬂow rate of 0 . 7 mL / min . Data analysis was carried out using ASTRA VI , yielding the radius of gyration of the sample ( 32 . 0 nm ± 0 . 4 % ) . For normalization of the light scattering detectors and data quality control , monomeric BSA ( Sigma ) was used . Variation of Mucin Size and Surface Densities Mucin Lengths MCF10As expressing Muc1 GFP - D CT with 0 , 10 , or 42 tandem repeats were sorted for similar levels of GFP on a BD FACs Aria II using the Muc1 antibody ﬁrst for the 42 tandem repeat population then the GFP nanobody Atto 647N ( Chromotek ) for the 0 , 10 , and 42 tandem repeat populations . Stable populations were created from these sorted lines . Cells were plated onto 8 mm coverslips at 10 , 000 cells / cm 2 for 16 - 18 h , then induced with 0 . 2 m g / mL of doxycycline ( Santa Cruz ) for 24 h and ﬁxed for SEM analysis . Mucin Cell Surface Density Using the GFP nanobody with an approximate size of 2 nm ( 15 kDa ) and picomolar afﬁnity for GFP ( GFP Binding Protein , Chromotek ) and labeled with NHS - Alexa Fluor 647 according to manufacturer’s protocol , 647 - nanobody , MCF10A cells expressing Muc1 - 42TR GFP D CT were labeled in 5 m g / ml 647 - nanobody for 20 min on ice to label only cell surface mucins . Cells were sorted with a BD FACS Aria II onto poly - l - lysine ( Trevigen / Cultrex ) - treated 8 mm coverslips at 5 , 000 to 10 , 000 cells / cm 2 for SEM , allowed to adhere for 4 h at 37 (cid:4) C , and ﬁxed for SEM imaging . Alternatively , cells were sorted with a BD FACS Aria II into 1 . 7 mL Eppendorf tubes , resuspended in 100 m L 0 . 5 % BSA in PBS , and lysed with 100 m L 2X RIPA lysis buffer for estimation of mucin surface densities via SDS - PAGE . Lysed samples were run simultaneously with 647 - nanobody standards of known molecular concentration . 647 - nanobody ﬂuorescence in lysed samples and standards were imaged on a Typhoon 9400 imaging system ( GE Healthcare ) . Total ﬂuorescence in each sample or standard was quantiﬁed in ImageJ Fiji ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) . A standard curve was constructed by relating ﬂuorescence from nano - body standards to their known concentration . The number of labeled mucins in each lysate were estimated based on the standard curve . The mucin surface density was estimated by dividing the total number of mucins by the known number of cells in each sample and their average surface area of 5 , 000 m m 2 based on an average radius of 20 m m and spherically shaped wild - type cells in suspen - sion . A standard curve was constructed based on the number of mucins per area and the known mean ﬂuorescence signal from the FACS collected population . This standard curve was then applied to calculate the number of mucins per area of populations collected subsequently . Expansion Microscopy Expansion microscopy ( ExM ) was performed as described previously ( Tillberg et al . , 2016 ) and involved steps of anchoring ﬂuores - cent dyes and proteins , gelation , digestion , and expansion to achieve dye retention and separation . Brieﬂy , ﬁxed and stained cells were anchored with 0 . 1 mg / ml Acryloyl - X , SE ( 6 - ( ( acryloyl ) amino ) hexanoic acid , succinimidyl ester ( ThermoFisher ) in PBS for 16 h at RT , washed twice and further incubated 1 h at 37 (cid:4) C in a monomer solution ( 1 3 PBS , 2 M NaCl , 8 . 625 % ( w / w ) sodium acrylate , 2 . 5 % ( w / w ) acrylamide , 0 . 15 % ( w / w ) N , N 0 - methylenebisacrylamide ) mixed with ammonium persulfate 0 . 2 % ( w / w ) initiator and tetramethy - lethylenediamine 0 . 2 % ( w / w ) accelerator for gelation . For digestion , gelled samples were gently transferred into 6 well glass bottom plates ( Cellvis ) and treated with Proteinase K ( New England Biolabs ) at 8 units / mL in digestion buffer ( 50 mM Tris ( pH 8 ) , 1 mM EDTA , 0 . 5 % Triton X - 100 , 1 M NaCl ) for 16 h at room temperature . For expansion , digested gels were washed in large excess volume of ddH 2 O for 1 h . This was repeated 4 – 6 times until the expansion plateaued . Samples were imaged on a Zeiss LSM inverted 880 confocal microscope using a 40x water immersion objective ( NA 1 . 1 ) in Airyscan mode to optimize resolution . Isolation of Extracellular Vesicles Cell were plated at 10 , 000 cells / cm 2 in appropriate dishes . Following induction with 1 m g / ml doxycycline ( Santa Cruz ) for 18 h , cells were rinsed with PBS twice then serum - starved for an additional 6 h with 1 m g / mL doxycycline ( Santa Cruz ) . For actin depolymer - ization studies , cells were treated for 60 min with 10 m M LatA ( Cayman Chemical ) in serum free media prior to isolation . For HAS3 digestion studies , cells were treated with 1 U / mL hyaluronidase for 60 min in serum - containing media before 6 h subsequent treat - ment in serum - starved media . For HeLa experiments , cells were sorted for high and low mucin expression and then immediately rinsed 2X in serum free media and spun at 200 x g for 5 min before 6 h serum starvation in the presence of 0 . 1 ug / mL EGF for micro - vesicle stimulation . Conditioned media from serum - starved cells was clariﬁed by pelleting cellular debris through two consecutive centrifugations at 600 x g for 5 min . Plunge - Freezing Vitriﬁcation From clariﬁed media , 3 – 5 m L of sample was pipetted onto holey carbon - coated 200 mesh copper grids ( Quantifoil Micro Tools , Jena , Germany ) with hole sizes of (cid:1) 2 m m . The grids were blotted from the reverse side and immediately plunged into a liquid ethane / pro - pane mixture cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature using a custom - built vitriﬁcation device ( MPI , Martinsried , Germany ) . The plunge - frozen grids were stored in sealed cryo - boxes in liquid nitrogen until used . Cryogenic Transmission Electron Microscopy Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy ( cryo - TEM ) was performed on a Titan Themis ( Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc , Waltham , MA ) operated at 300 kV in energy - ﬁltered mode , equipped with a ﬁeld - emission gun , and 3838x3710 pixel Gatan K2 Summit direct Cell 177 , 1757 – 1770 . e1 – e13 , June 13 , 2019 e9 detector camera ( Gatan , Pleasanton , CA ) operating in Counted , dose - fractionated modes . Images were collected at a defoci of between - 1 m m and - 3 m m . Images were binned by 2 , resulting in pixel sizes of 0 . 72 – 1 . 1 nm . Theoretical Model Details Glycocalyx Polymer Brush Model We propose a simple model to explain how biopolymers in the glycocalyx can generate entropic driving forces for membrane cur - vature . The model considers long chain polymers anchored on one end to the plasma membrane . Common examples of long - chain polymers in the glycocalyx include mucins and hyaluronic acid ( HA ) , which we model speciﬁcally here . The modeling framework could be similarly applied to other types of glycocalyx polymers , including polysialic acid and other glycosaminoglycans . Hyaluronic acid is a semi - ﬂexible linear polysaccharide comprised of repeating units of glucuronic acid and N - acetylglucosamine . Mucins have a more complex bottlebrush structure comprised of a central polypeptide backbone and densely clustered glycan side chains along the backbone . Although their structure is complex , bottlebrush polymers can be modelled as effective linear polymers with a mono - mer size on the order of the side chains ( Paturej et al . , 2016 ) . Therefore , we consider all glycocalyx polymers in our model to be linear or effectively linear . Biopolymers in the glycocalyx are anchored to the cell surface in several ways , including through transmembrane anchors , cova - lent conjugation to integral membrane proteins , and non - covalently to speciﬁc transmembrane receptors . Cell surface mucins are anchored directly near their carboxy terminus by a single transmembrane domain . Hyaluronic acid is anchored to the cell surface through speciﬁc transmembrane receptors on the cell surface . While it is possible for hyaluronic acid to be anchored at multiple points along the polymer backbone , for simplicity , we consider all glycocalyx polymers to have a single membrane anchor at one end . The cell surface is also decorated with many types of integral and peripheral membrane proteins . These molecules could also contribute to an entropic pressure on the cell membrane , similar to a 2D gas pressure . To isolate the effects of glycocalyx polymers on the membrane , we neglect possible contributions from other cell surface proteins , as well as intracellular forces . However , the model could be extended to include these additional contributions to the system energy . Biopolymers have excluded volumes accounting for steric interactions between monomers on the same polymer as well as be - tween monomers on adjacent molecules ( de Gennes , 1980 ) . Large negative charges on acidic sugars , such as glucuronic acid and sialic acid , give rise to intramolecular and intermolecular electrostatic interactions ( Israels et al . , 1994 ) . Finally , the polymers and the brush have entropic contributions due to the elastic energy , which captures the stretch of the molecules ( de Gennes , 1980 ) . Embedded in a deformable lipid membrane , the energy of this polymer glycocalyx and that of the membrane can minimize to yield the equilibrium conﬁguration ( Lipowsky , 1995 ; Stachowiak et al . , 2012 ) . Hence , in our model below , we perform an energy minimization of the glycocalyx and the underlying membrane to describe the surface curvature . Depending on surface density , polymers tethered to a surface exhibit two particular regimes of physical behavior – mushroom and brush . The Flory radius measures the approximate size of an entire polymer , and is given by R F z l a N n a = l n l 1 (cid:3) n a , where l a is the size of each monomer or effective monomer , N a is the number of such monomers in a polymer , l is the fully extended length of the polymer chain , and n is called the Flory exponent . n y 0 : 6 for hydrophilic biopolymers in good solvents like water . At low densities , such that intermolecular spacing is larger than the polymer Flory radius , i . e . C G < 1 = ð R F Þ 2 , where C G is biopolymer concentration , biopolymers take up preferable conformations independent of neighbor interactions . In this regime , the ﬂexible molecules can coil up to exhibit mushroom - like structures . On the other hand , at high surface concentrations , when the intermolecular spacing is smaller than the Flory radius , intermolecular interactions can dominate and stretch the biopolymers out into a brush - like structure . The polymer layer extension or thickness , the stored energy , and the generated membrane curvatures exhibit different scaling laws in these regimes , as described below . In the mushroom regime , the attachment of a biopolymer to a ﬂat , impenetrable surface reduces the number of accessible molec - ular conformations relative to those of a polymer free in solution . Attachment to a substrate eliminates polymer shapes that would have to penetrate the surface . Curving the impenetrable grafting surface can free up space for the polymer , marginally increasing the permissible conﬁgurations and the entropy of the polymer . Thus , ﬂexible biopolymers tethered to a deformable membrane can generate curvatures , as described by Lipowsky ( Lipowsky , 1995 ) . However , the additional entropy due to membrane curvature is small and consequently , curvatures generated by polymer mushrooms are also small , relative to deformations elicited by intermo - lecular interactions in polymer brushes . In this mushroom regime , the free energy due to the entropic contribution of each mushroom polymer tethered to a curved membrane is : F mushroom = (cid:3) TS mushroom (cid:1) (cid:3) k B T 2 p R mushroom R ; ( 1 ) where the reference conﬁguration is the polymer tethered to a ﬂat surface , S mushroom is the corresponding entropic contribution , R mushroom is the Flory radius of the mushroom - shaped biopolymer , and R is the radius of curvature of the underlying membrane . In the mushroom regime , we consider the formation of spherical membrane structures . The bending energy of the curved membrane is : F membrane = k 2 C G R 2 ; ( 2 ) e10 Cell 177 , 1757 – 1770 . e1 – e13 , June 13 , 2019 where k is the bending stiffness of the membrane bilayer , C G is the surface density of the biopolymers , and 1 = C G is the area avail - able for each polymer . Minimizing the total energy , F total = F mushroom + F membrane with respect to the radius of curvature , R , as v F total = v R = 0 , we obtain the following scaling law for R : R (cid:1) k k B T 1 2 p C G l a N n a ; ( 3 ) where l a is the size of a monomeric segment and N a is the number of such segments in a polymer . At high surface densities , such that neighboring polymer molecules interact with each other , grafted polymers exhibit a brush - like structure ( de Gennes , 1980 ) . Intermolecular steric and electrostatic interactions are signiﬁcantly higher in this regime , implying the creation of higher curvature - generating forces . In this regime , we consider the formation of tubular structures from the membrane and predict the tubule curvatures generated by intermolecular crowding effects on the cell surface . An energy minimization approach elucidates the equilibrium curvature and brush extension as follows . For a tubule with radius R , the energy of the glycocalyx per length of the tubule contains elastic , excluded volume , and electrostatic components ( Borisov and Zhulina , 2002 ; Bracha et al . , 2013 ; Zhu - lina et al . , 2006 ) : F brush = F elastic + F excluded volume + F electrostatic ; ( 4 ) F brush = k B T Z R + H R " 3 2 l 2 a c p s + (cid:2) w + a 2 b 2 F ion (cid:3) c 2 p s # dr ; ( 5 ) where R is the radius of the tubule , H is the thickness of the glycocalyx brush , l a is the size of monomeric segments that form the biopolymers , c p is the monomer concentration , and s is the area per polymer . At the tubule surface , the area per polymer , s ð r = R Þ is related to the biopolymer surface density , C G , as s ð r = R Þ = 1 = C G . w is the excluded volume of monomer segments , a b is the degree of ionization of a monomer , F ion is the ion concentration in bulk solution , and r is a radial coordinate . Zhulina et al . ( Zhulina et al . , 2006 ) provide expressions for c p . Given the monomer length and diameter are similar ( Paturej et al . , 2016 ) , we consider the monomeric segments to be cylinders with an aspect ratio close to 1 . The energy per length of the underlying membrane bent into the tubular structure is ( Helfrich , 1973 ) : F membrane = pk R ; ( 6 ) where k is the membrane bending modulus . Thus , the total energy per tubule length is : F total = F brush + F membrane = k B T Z R + H R " 3 2 l 2 a c p s + (cid:2) w + a 2 b 2 F ion (cid:3) c 2 p s # dr + pk R : ( 7 ) Minimizing the total energy with respect to the tubule radius ð dF total = dR = 0 Þ reveals the dependence of the spontaneous curvature on the properties of the glycocalyx and the cell membrane , including the surface density of biopolymers . We consider the implications of this theory for native Muc1 , as an example mucin . We course - grain the bottlebrush biopolymer into N a effective monomers of size l a ; eff ( Paturej et al . , 2016 ) . In this work , we measure the radius of gyration , R G , of Muc1 to be 32 nm . We estimate the overall stretched length , l , to be 270 nm based on electron micrographs of Muc1 puriﬁed from human HEp - 2 epithelial cells ( Bramwell et al . , 1986 ) . The radius of gyration is related to the Flory radius by R G z ð 1 = ﬃﬃﬃ 6 p Þ R F = ð 1 = ﬃﬃﬃ 6 p Þ l n l 1 (cid:3) n a ; eff . Using estimates of R G = 32 nm , l = 270 nm , and n = 0 . 6 , we estimate the mucin to be described by N a = 18 effective monomeric segments each having a size of l a ; eff = 15 nm . We note that this effective monomer size is in good agreement with expectations based on estimates of the mucin side chain size to be 5 - 10 nm ( Kesimer et al . , 2013 ; McMaster et al . , 1999 ) . We assume that sialic acids on mucins contribute to a charge density of approximately 5 e (cid:3) per 20 amino acid tandem repeat . Our assumption is based on most mucin O - glycosylation sites being occupied with sialylated glycans ( Ba¨ckstro¨m et al . , 2003 ; Mu¨ller et al . , 1999 ) . The scaling law for the mucin mushroom regime predicts small spontaneous curvatures for low biopolymer densities ( Figure 4C ) . The predicted spontaneous curvatures are comparable to the curvatures of the bleb - like protrusions observed in cells expressing low surface densities of mucins , as shown in Figure 5B , 180 mucins / m m 2 . For higher densities , where the biopolymers form a brush , the corresponding model above predicts the generation of curvatures similar or greater to those observed in the tubules on the cells of Figure 5B , 52 , 000 mucins / m m 2 . The curvature of such tubules is predicted to increase exponentially with biopolymer density . Notably , the continuous transition between mushroom and brush regimes predicted about a biopolymer density of 250 # / m m 2 accompanies a change in cell surface morphology from bleb - like to tubulated ( Figures 5B , 5D , and 5E ) . Similarly , HA molecules closely resemble linear polymer chains . For instance , a 1 MDa HA molecule has a length of 2 . 5 m m when stretched out and can be modeled as a chain of 250 monomeric units approximately 10 nm long ( Cleland Robert , 2004 ; Hayashi et al . , 1995 ) . Polymer theory predicts such a polymer to have a large Flory radius of about 1 m m , which is more than an order of magnitude larger than that of Muc1 . Thus , HA is expected to have a much larger effective volume and physical presence on the cell surface than Cell 177 , 1757 – 1770 . e1 – e13 , June 13 , 2019 e11 Muc1 . The consequently stronger intramolecular and intermolecular interactions in HA should render it signiﬁcantly more effective at bending the membrane than Muc1 . Consequently , considerably lower surface density of HA is expected to generate the same mem - brane curvature as a surface densely crowded with Muc1 . We also conducted preliminary calculations for the speciﬁc example of HA . Adopting the approach of Bracha et al . on DNA , also a linear polyelectrolyte , we coarse grained hyaluronic acid into N a cylindrical segments of length l a and diameter d to allow application of polymer brush theory scaling laws ( Bracha et al . , 2013 ) . The Kuhn length , l a , of the biopolymers is twice the persistence length and the length scale at which the molecule is straight . Hyaluronic acid is semi - rigid owing to the local stiffness that arises from intrinsically large size of the sugar ring monomers and the hindered rotations about the glycosidic linkages ( Day and Sheehan , 2001 ) . Measure - ments of the persistence length range from 5 to 9 nm . The diameter of the hyaluronic acid chain is about 0 . 6 nm ( Cowman et al . , 2005 ) . In this work , we measure the molecular weight of hyaluronic acid produced by the hyaluronic acid synthase 3 ( HAS3 ) to be approx - imately 3 MDa . This large size corresponds to a fully stretch length of approximately 10 m m , assuming a disaccharide size of 1 nm . Force Requirements for Cell Surface Blebs and Tubes To predict the relative frequencies of blebs and tubes on the cell surface , we perform energetic calculations for the cell membrane . The crowding pressure of the glycopolymers effectively increases the natural curvature of the cell membrane . Hence , we lump together the crowding effects of the glycocalyx into a spontaneous membrane curvature , c 0 . Intracellular forces pushing the cell membrane out , e . g . actin polymerization , can generate cylindrical tubes ( Weichsel and Geiss - ler , 2016 ) . Here we consider a tube of length L and radius R tube generated due to a force f . On the other hand , a hydrostatic pressure difference p between inside and outside the cell can form spherical blebs of radius R bleb ( Charras and Paluch , 2008 ) . The energy of the membrane in these conﬁgurations includes the bending energy , surface tension , and contributions from the pressure p or the force f ( Dere´nyi et al . , 2002 ; Helfrich , 1973 ; Seifert et al . , 1991 ) : F = Z A k 2 ð c 1 + c 2 (cid:3) c 0 Þ 2 dA + s A (cid:3) pV (cid:3) fL ; ( 8 ) where k is the bending stiffness of the membrane , c 1 and c 2 are the principal curvatures , c 0 is the spontaneous curvature of the membrane – generated due to the crowding pressure of the biopolymers , A is the area of the membrane , and s is the surface tension of the membrane . For tubes , p = 0 ; f s 0 ; and L is the length of the tube , whereas for blebs , f = 0 ; p s 0 ; and V is the bleb volume . A cylindrical tube of radius R tube has spontaneous curvatures , c 1 = 0 and c 2 = 1 = R tube , which simplify the energy : F tube = " k 2 (cid:2) 1 R tube (cid:3) c 0 (cid:3) 2 + s # 2 p R tube L (cid:3) fL : ( 9 ) The case of a spherical bleb with a very thin neck provides an upper limit on the energy of a bleb . For a bleb with radius R bleb , c 1 = c 2 = 1 = R bleb , and F bleb = " k 2 (cid:2) 2 R bleb (cid:3) c 0 (cid:3) 2 + s # 4 p R 2 bleb (cid:3) 4 p R 3 bleb 3 p : ( 10 ) At equilibrium , these energies are minimized with respect to the radii of the blebs and tubes ( Dere´nyi et al . , 2002 ) . The tube energy is also minimized with respect to the tube length L at steady state ( Dere´nyi et al . , 2002 ) . That is , v F tube v R tube = 0 ; v F tube v L = 0 ; ( 11 ) and v F bleb v R bleb = 0 ( 12 ) at equilibrium . The equilibrium equations ( Eq . 11 ) for the tube imply : R tube = 1 ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ c 20 + 2 s = k p ; ( 13 ) and f = 2 pk (cid:2) ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ c 20 + 2 s = k q (cid:3) c 0 (cid:3) : ( 14 ) These equilibrium calculations predict the tube radius is completely governed by the mechanical properties of the lipid bilayer and the spontaneous curvature , which in this case is generated by intermolecular interactions in the glycocalyx brush . These calculations do not account for the structural support of actin ﬁlaments widening the tubes . e12 Cell 177 , 1757 – 1770 . e1 – e13 , June 13 , 2019 Bleb energy minimization ( Eq . 12 ) yields the pressure requirement for a bleb of a given size : p = 2 s R bleb (cid:3) c 0 k R bleb (cid:2) 2 R bleb (cid:3) c 0 (cid:3) : ( 15 ) Eq . 13 - 15 relate the force or pressure required to maintain a tube or bleb with the spontaneous curvature generated by the biopoly - mers . Figure 4C details the dependence of the spontaneous curvature on biopolymer concentration . We thus graph the force and pressure requirements against the biopolymer concentration ( Figure 4D ) . Comparisons with typically observed forces from actin polymerization and hydrostatic pressures explain the relative densities of tubes and blebs as a function of biopolymer density . QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Scanning Electron Microscopy Quantiﬁcation Cellular tube density , diameter , and length were analyzed in ImageJ Fiji ( Schindelin et al . , 2012 ) . For quantiﬁcation of tube density per area , a (cid:1) 2 m m 3 2 m m region of interest was drawn , and the encompassed tubes counted manually using the cell counter plug - in .
