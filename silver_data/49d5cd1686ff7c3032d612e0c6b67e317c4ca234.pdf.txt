However , little is known whether this tiny protein also plays an important role in immunity , thereby keeping body from the cancer development and metastasis . Here , we investigated the functions of transgelin‑2 in dendritic cell ( DC ) immunity . Further , we inves‑ tigated whether the non‑viral transduction of cell‑permeable transgelin‑2 peptide potentially enhance DC‑based cancer immunotherapy . Methods : To understand the functions of transgelin‑2 in DCs , we utilized bone marrow‑derived DCs ( BMDCs ) puri‑ fied from transgelin‑2 knockout ( Tagln2 − / − ) mice . To observe the dynamic cellular mechanism of transgelin‑2 , we utilized confocal microscopy and flow cytometry . To monitor DC migration and cognate T – DC interaction in vivo , we used intravital two‑photon microscopy . For the solid and metastasis tumor models , OVA + B16F10 melanoma were inoculated into the C57BL / 6 mice via intravenously ( i . v . ) and subcutaneously ( s . c . ) , respectively . OTI TCR T cells were used for the adoptive transfer experiments . Cell‑permeable , de‑ubiquitinated recombinant transgelin‑2 was purified from Escherichia coli and applied for DC‑based adoptive immunotherapy . Results : We found that transgelin‑2 is remarkably expressed in BMDCs during maturation and lipopolysaccharide activation , suggesting that this protein plays a role in DC‑based immunity . Although Tagln2 − / − BMDCs exhibited no changes in maturation , they showed significant defects in their abilities to home to draining lymph nodes ( LNs ) and prime T cells to produce antigen‑specific T cell clones , and these changes were associated with a failure to suppress tumor growth and metastasis of OVA + B16F10 melanoma cells in mice . Tagln2 − / − BMDCs had defects in filopodia‑like membrane protrusion and podosome formation due to the attenuation of the signals that modulate actin remod‑ eling in vitro and formed short , unstable contacts with cognate CD4 + T cells in vivo . Strikingly , non‑viral transduction of cell‑permeable , de‑ubiquitinated recombinant transgelin‑2 potentiated DC functions to suppress tumor growth and metastasis . Conclusion : This work demonstrates that transgelin‑2 is an essential protein for both cancer and immunity . There‑ fore , transgelin‑2 can act as a double‑edged sword depending on how we apply this protein to cancer therapy . © The Author ( s ) 2021 .

J Hematol Oncol ( 2021 ) 14 : 43 Introduction Dendritic cells ( DCs ) are professional antigen - presenting cells that survey tissues for foreign antigens [ 1 , 2 ] . Fol - lowing an encounter with a foreign antigen , DCs are acti - vated in a process involving the capture and processing of the antigen , expression of lymphocyte co - stimulatory molecules , migration to lymphoid tissues like the spleen and lymph node for completion of their maturation , and secretion of cytokines to initiate the adaptive immune response [ 3 , 4 ] . During maturation and migration to the lymph node , DCs undergo global rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton , which are mediated through specific temporal and spatial actions of actin - binding or regula - tory proteins [ 1 ] . Rac1 / 2 , a small G - protein responsible for ruffling movements , is essential for the interaction between DCs and T cells [ 5 , 6 ] . The formin mDia1 is essential for DC adhesion , migration , and sustained interaction with T cells [ 7 ] . Wiskott – Aldrich syndrome protein , a molecule that controls Arp2 / 3 - dependent actin polymerization , is required for the formation of the immunological synapse ( IS ) and DC migration [ 8 – 10 ] . The cortactin HS1 is necessary for organizing the podo - some array and is primarily required for directional per - sistence of migrating DCs [ 11 , 12 ] . However , none of these actin regulators is specific for DC functions as they are ubiquitously expressed and function in most mam - malian cells [ 1 ] . Thus , the discovery of a DC - specific actin regulatory protein would help us understand how DC immunity is linked to dynamic actin remodeling at a fundamental level . Transgelin - 2 , a 22 - kDa actin - binding protein , is one of three transgelin family members characterized by their actin cross - linking and gelling properties [ 13 ] . Although the topic is still debated , transgelin - 2 has been impli - cated in tumorigenesis and cancer development [ 14 ] . Indeed , its upregulation is correlated with the clinical stage , tumor size , and invasion in a wide spectrum of cancers [ 15 ] . We previously found that transgelin - 2 is also expressed in lymphocytes and functions to stabilize the immunological synapse , thereby enhancing T cell activation [ 16 , 17 ] . It is also involved in filopodium ini - tiation and / or elongation presumably by interfering with the interaction between the Arp2 / 3 complex and actin [ 18 ] , which may drive the enhanced phagocytic behav - ior of macrophages toward invading bacteria [ 19 ] . Taken together , these results suggest that transgelin - 2 is not only important for tumorigenesis and cancer progression but is also essential for immune functions . In the present study , we observed that although transgelin - 2 is not at all or only minimally expressed in immature BMDCs , it is dramatically expressed dur - ing granulocyte – macrophage colony - stimulating fac - tor ( GM - CSF ) - or FMS - like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand ( Flt3L ) - induced maturation and lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) activation . This suggests that transgelin - 2 may play a role during DC maturation or DC - mediated priming of antigen - specific T cells . In support of this idea , previous reports demonstrated that the actin bundling protein fas - cin is induced upon DC maturation and involved in the antigen presentation activities of mature DCs [ 20 , 21 ] . Why would DCs require the expression of an actin bun - dling protein specific to DCs ? Since the main functions of DCs , which distinguish them from other cells , are to continuously capture , deliver , and process antigens and present them to T cells [ 22 ] , mature DCs may require actin regulatory proteins optimized for DC functions . In addition , this suggests that these proteins are not redun - dant and that each may have distinctive roles for mature DC functions . Here , we investigated the subcellular local - ization and functions of transgelin - 2 in BMDCs . Two - photon microscopy was utilized to monitor the in vivo migration of BMDCs , as well as their dynamic interac - tion with T cells . BMDCs with genetic ablation of Tagln2 ( Tagln2 − / − ) exhibited significant defects in homing to the draining lymph node and priming of antigen - specific T cells for clonal expansion and cytokine production . Sur - prisingly , exogenous introduction of a cell - permeable and ubiquitination site - mutated ( K78R ) recombinant transgelin - 2 ( dU - TG2P ) into BMDCs significantly poten - tiated tumor regression in vivo , suggesting a potential use for transgelin - 2 peptides in DC - mediated anticancer therapy . In summary , our findings indicate that transge - lin - 2 positively regulates DC - mediated adaptive immune responses . Results Tagln2 ‑knockout ( Tagln2 − / − ) DCs do not optimally control B16F10 tumor metastasis and growth in mice Previously , we reported that transgelin - 2 is highly expressed in immune - related tissues , such as the Engineering and clinical application of this protein may unveil a new era in DC‑based cancer immunotherapy . Our findings indicate that cell‑permeable transgelin‑2 have a potential clinical value as a cancer immunotherapy based on DCs .

J Hematol Oncol ( 2021 ) 14 : 43 thymus , spleen , and LNs [ 16 ] . Transgelin - 2 is also dom - inantly expressed in lymphocytes and plays an impor - tant role in stabilizing the IS , thereby enhancing T cell - mediated immune responses [ 16 , 17 , 23 ] . In addi - tion , we found that transgelin - 2 is physically associ - ated with the integrin lymphocyte function - associated antigen - 1 ( LFA - 1 ) , which enhances the adhesion of cytotoxic T cells to intercellular adhesion molecule - 1 ( ICAM - 1 ) - positive tumor target cells , such as E0771 cells , but not ICAM - 1 - negative B16F10 cells [ 17 ] . In accordance with the previous results , overexpression of transgelin - 2 ( TG2 ) in OTI T cells did not enhance T cell adhesion to ovalbumin ( OVA ) - pulsed B16F10 target cells in vitro and showed only a mild effect on B16F10 tumor regression in vivo ( Fig . 1a , b ) . Interest - ingly , however , we observed that whole - body transge - lin - 2 - KO ( Tagln2 − / − ) mice , as compared to wild - type ( WT ) mice , developed rapid B16F10 - derived tumor growth , resulting in increased tumor weights and sizes ( Fig . 1c ) . Kaplan – Meier survival studies 40 days after tumor injection showed that WT mice had a median survival time of 35 days . However , Tagln2 − / − mice had a median survival time of only 28 days ( Fig . 1c ) . These results suggest that cell types other than T cells can participate in tumor regression independently of the LFA - 1 / ICAM - 1 interaction between cytotoxic T cells and tumor target cells . Since DCs play a major role in processing and pre - senting antigen peptides to antigen - specific T cells , we next asked whether DCs express transgelin - 2 or other isotypes , such as transgelin - 1 and - 3 . Interestingly , immature DCs isolated from bone marrow ( BM ) did not express transgelin family members ( Fig . 1d ) . How - ever , transgelin - 2 was highly expressed during GM - CSF - induced differentiation ( Fig . 1d ) . The expression of transgelin - 2 was also induced in fully differentiated BMDCs in response to LPS ( Fig . 1e ) , suggesting a spe - cific role of transgelin - 2 in mature BMDCs . To understand the significance of transgelin - 2 expres - sion in mature DCs , we used mature BMDCs from WT ( Tagln2 + / + ) and Tagln2 − / − mice ( Fig . 1f ) , which were previously generated in our laboratory [ 16 ] . To determine whether transgelin - 2 regulates the functions of BMDCs , OVA257 – 264 - pulsed WT or transgelin - 2 - knockout ( KO ) BMDCs were i . v . injected into mice , thereby generating cytotoxic T cell clones against the OVA257 – 264 peptide in vivo ( Fig . 1g ) . At 7 days after DC injection , the mice were i . v . injected with OVA + B16F10 melanoma cells . The metastatic colonies were evaluated at day 14 , and a sig - nificant increase in metastatic nodules was observed in mice with adoptively transferred OVA257 – 264 - pulsed Tagln2 − / − BMDCs compared to OVA257 – 264 - pulsed WT BMDCs ( Fig . 1h ) . For the solid tumor model , OVA + B16F10 cells were implanted into the mammary fat pads of C57BL / 6 female mice previously injected with WT BMDCs or Tagln2 − / − BMDCs . In accordance with the metastatic model , Tagln2 − / − BMDCs could not opti - mally control tumor growth in mice ( Fig . 1i ) . Kaplan – Meier survival studies showed that mice injected with OVA257 – 264 - pulsed WT BMDCs had a median sur - vival time of 40 days . However , mice adoptively trans - ferred with OVA257 – 264 - pulsed Tagln2 − / − BMDCs had a median survival time of only 34 days similar to PBS control group ( Fig . 1j ) . Further , we observed a significant reduction in CD8 + tumor - infiltrating lymphocytes ( TILs ) in the B16F10 tumors from Tagln2 − / − DC - injected mice ( WT vs . KO , 9 . 8 ± 1 . 5 vs . 1 . 8 ± 1 . 1 ) ( Fig . 1k ) . In addition , the tumor - infiltrating CD8 + T cells from Tagln2 − / − DC - injected mice expressed a lower level of IFNγ than that in WT DC - injected mice ( Fig . 1l ) . Among various DC subsets , conventional type 1 DCs ( cDC1s ) are the main cellular source of IL - 12 , a fundamental cytokine for anti - cancer CD8 + CTL activation , and the super promising ( See figure on next page . ) Fig . 1 Tagln2 − / − BMDCs do not optimally control B16F10 tumor metastasis and growth in mice . a Effect of transgelin‑2 expression in T cells for adhesion to B16F10 tumor cells .

PBS ( none ) , WT ( OTI‑T ) , KO ( Tagln2 − / − OTI‑T ) , or transgelin‑2‑overexpressing T ( TG2OE OTI‑T ) cells were adoptively injected into C57BL / 6 mice after OVA + B16F10 inoculation .

J Hematol Oncol ( 2021 ) 14 : 43 DC subset for induction of anti - tumor immunity due to their superior capacity to uptake dying or dead cell mate - rials and to process tumor - associated antigens for cross - presentation [ 24 – 26 ] . We therefore determined whether transgelin - 2 is also expressed in Flt3L - induced cDC1s . To this end , BM - isolated immature DCs were treated with Flt3 ligand for 9 days , and analyzed the expression of surface markers and transgelin - 2 ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S1A and B ) . We found that transgelin - 2 was also dramati - cally induced during Flt3L - induced cDC1 differentiation , while transgelin - 2 - KO followed the normal differen - tiation patterns as judged by the expressions of CD103 , CD24 , and XCR1 ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S1A and B ) . We next evaluated the antitumor activity of Tagln2 − / − cDC1s against s . c . injected OVA + B16F10 cells . Similar to the GM - CSF - induced BMDCs , Tagln2 − / − cDC1s were not able to optimally control tumor growth in mice ( Addi - tional file 1 : Fig . S1C ) , suggesting that transgelin - 2 is also important for the function of cDC1s to facilitate optimal antigen presentation . Transgelin‑2 is essential for global actin rearrangements in activated DCs To investigate the mechanism by which transge - lin - 2 affects the function of DCs , we analyzed mature BMDCs obtained from Tagln2 − / − mice and compared them with WT BMDCs in terms of their morphol - ogy , actin dynamics , and signaling . Morphologically , although there were no gross differences between WT and KO mice , Tagln2 − / − BMDCs exhibited an absence of filopodia - like membrane protrusions , as determined by scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) ( Fig . 2a , yel - low arrowheads ) . To understand this morphological phenotype , LPS - stimulated WT BMDCs were stained for F - actin and transgelin - 2 and visualized by confo - cal microscopy . As shown in Fig . 2b , transgelin - 2 was specifically localized at the leading edge of lamellipo - dia , where filopodia are formed from the pre - existing meshwork of Arp2 / 3 complex - branched filaments . In addition , transgelin - 2 co - localized with F - actin in the actin - rich cores of podosomes , which were surrounded by vinculin in the stereotypical podosome organization ( Fig . 2b , right ) . Podosomes are characteristics of cells in the myeloid lineage , including DCs , macrophages , and osteoclasts , which can degrade extracellular matri - ces and play a role in the migration of DCs through tissues [ 27 ] . Thus , the localization of transgelin - 2 in filopodia tips , as well as in podosomes , demonstrated that transgelin - 2 is involved in the membrane protru - sions that support DC migration and interactions with T cells for proper antigen presentation . To this end , we next assessed podosome formation and spreading dur - ing DC activation in response to LPS and fibronectin ( Fn ) , respectively . DCs have been shown to exhibit transient podosome loss at approximately 20 min after their activation with LPS and then recover them again after 2 h [ 27 , 28 ] . Like - wise , in our study , BMDCs from both WT and KO mice showed a substantial reduction in the number of cells with podosomes after 30 min of stimulation with LPS . However , podosomes were significantly slower to reform in Tagln2 − / − BMDCs after 2 h ( Fig . 2c ) . Next , since the interaction of BMDCs with extracellular matrix ( ECM ) proteins , such as Fn , induces a dynamic cytoskeletal rear - rangement driven by actin polymerization , thereby medi - ating cell adhesion and migration through integrins [ 28 , 29 ] , we evaluated the effects of the transgelin - 2 KO on DC spreading and actin polymerization . Compared to WT BMDCs , Tagln2 − / − BMDCs exhibited reduced cell spreading and lower levels of polymerized actin when seeded on Fn ( Fig . 2d ) . Taken together , these results strongly suggest that transgelin - 2 has a specific role in DC migration by modulating filopodia and podosome formation , and cell spreading on ECM . CCR7 is necessary for directing DCs to secondary lym - phoid nodes and eliciting an adaptive immune response [ 30 , 31 ] . Furthermore , CCR7 induces actin rearrange - ments by activating Akt and Erk signaling , as well as the G i - dependent activation of MAPK members Erk1 / 2 , Jnk , and p38 [ 32 ] . To determine whether transgelin - 2 is linked to dynamic actin signaling in mature BMDCs , we examined signaling downstream of CCR7 activation by CCL19 . PI3K and its downstream effector Akt were both significantly attenuated in Tagln2 − / − BMDCs . Similarly , Fig . 2 Transgelin‑2 is essential for global actin rearrangements in activating DCs . a SEM images of WT or Tagln2 − / − DCs in the resting state . b Localization of transgelin‑2 in DCs .

J Hematol Oncol ( 2021 ) 14 : 43 p38 and Erk signaling were also reduced in these cells ( Fig . 2e ) . Tagln2 − / − DCs showed impaired migration into the lymph node Reduced CCR7 - mediated signaling led us to examine whether transgelin - 2 deficiency was connected with the expression of chemokine receptors or adhesion mol - ecules on the surface of DCs . We found no differences in the expression levels of surface proteins between WT and KO BMDCs . However , Tagln2 − / − BMDCs exhib - ited dramatic defects in migration in response to vari - ous chemokines , such as CCL3 , 5 , 19 , 21 , and SDF - 1α ( Fig . 3a ) . We further performed live time - lapse imaging to further monitor how DCs responded to stimulation with the chemokine CCL19 . Although WT BMDCs read - ily spread , formed membrane protrusions , and showed a typical dendritic morphology , Tagln2 − / − BMDCs were round and irregularly shaped , with a relative absence of a protrusive morphology ( Fig . 3b and additional movie files show this in more detail . [ See Additional files 2 – 5 ] ) , suggesting that the spatial and temporal regulation of the actin cytoskeleton is impaired in Tagln2 − / − BMDCs . We therefore next asked whether DC migration was also impaired in vivo in Tagln2 − / − mice . To this end , we co - injected differentially labeled BMDCs from WT or Tagln2 − / − mice into the footpads of normal recipient mice . Draining popliteal LNs were collected at 24 h post - injection , and the presence of migrated DCs was assessed by flow cytometry ( Fig . 3c ) . Fixed tissues were also exam - ined under confocal microscopy ( Fig . 3d ) . In contrast to WT BMDCs , which reached the draining LNs nor - mally , there was a significant reduction in the number of Tagln2 − / − BMDCs observed in the draining LNs ( Fig . 3c , d ) , thus demonstrating that transgelin - 2 influences the migration rate of DCs in vivo . Tagln2 − / − DCs do not optimally support T cell activation Although enlarged draining popliteal LNs were observed in recipient OTII TCR mice adoptively transferred with OVA323 – 339 - pulsed WT BMDCs , no significant change in LN size was seen with Tagln2 − / − BMDCs ( Fig . 4a ) . This result suggests that antigen - specific OTII CD4 + T cells may be less pro - liferative in mice injected with Tagln2 − / − BMDCs . As expected , the population of Tagln2 − / − BMDCs ( CD11c + cells ) that migrated into the draining LN was significantly smaller than that of WT BMDCs ( Fig . 4b ) . Interestingly , however , the expression of co - stimulatory molecules , such as CD80 and CD40 , was not altered in Tagln2 − / − BMDCs in vivo , suggesting that transgelin - 2 has little effect on the ability of DCs to express these co - stimulatory factors . This result led us to ask whether the migratory defects seen in Tagln2 − / − BMDCs were the only driver of the reduced antitumor response ( Fig . 1h , i ) or whether another mechanism was also involved . To this end , we investigated the role of transgelin - 2 in the direct DC - mediated T cell response in vitro . OVA323 – 339 - pulsed BMDCs were co - cultured with OTII CD4 + T cells , and the surface expression of CD69 or CD25 on T cells was determined . Interestingly , the expression of these activation markers was significantly reduced in T cells co - cultured with Tagln2 − / − BMDCs , thereby indi - cating a second role for transgelin - 2 in DCs . To understand how Tagln2 − / − BMDCs attenuated T cell activation in vivo , we performed an in vitro activa - tion assay . We first determined whether transgelin - 2 KO affected the differentiation of immature DCs into mature DCs . During GM - CSF - induced differentiation , Tagln2 − / − BM cells followed the normal differentia - tion patterns based on the surface expression of CD11c ( Fig . 5a ) . In addition , the expression levels of MHC class II and co - stimulatory molecules , such as CD80 , CD86 , and CD40 , were not significantly different in either WT or Tagln2 − / − BMDCs by LPS stimulation ( Fig . 5b ) . Further , the expression levels of DC cytokines such as IL - 1β and IL - 12 were similar in both WT and Tagln2 − / − BMDCs ( Fig . 5c ) . By contrast , the activa - tion of OTII CD4 + T cells was significantly reduced in OVA323 – 339 - pulsed Tagln2 − / − BMDCs as determined by the expression of CD69 and CD25 , and the secre - tion of IL - 4 , IL - 2 , and IFN - γ ( Fig . 5d – f ) . Indeed , higher levels of antigen peptide were required to produce a similar amount of cytokines in the Tagln2 − / − BMDCs ( Fig . 5e , f ) .

J Hematol Oncol ( 2021 ) 14 : 43 would be unable to optimally activate antigen - spe - cific T cells to expand in vivo . To this end , C57BL / 6 mice were injected with OVA257 – 264 - pulsed WT or Tagln2 − / − BMDCs via the footpad . After 7 days , CD3 + T cells were purified and examined for proliferation and cytokine secretion in response to the same OVA257 – 264 - pulsed WT BMDCs in vitro . As shown in Fig . 5g , h , Tagln2 − / − BMDCs induced lower levels of cell pro - liferation and cytokine secretion , suggesting that they could not optimally support T cell clonal expansion in vivo . Deletion of transgelin‑2 reduces DC contact with T cells T cell activation and differentiation require sustained interaction with cognate DCs via integrin affinity and avidity regulation . In a previous study , we showed that transgelin - 2 in T cells is associated with LFA - 1 and can regulate LFA - 1 avidity [ 17 ] . We therefore tested whether transgelin - 2 is also involved in DC - mediated T cell adhe - sion . However , SEM analysis revealed no differences between WT and Tagln2 − / − BMDCs ( Fig . 6a ) . To assess the adhesion strength between BMDCs and T cells in a quantitative manner , we performed a conjugation assay in the presence of an OVA peptide . We found that Tagln2 − / − BMDCs showed a significant reduction in con - jugation ( Fig . 6b ) , demonstrating that transgelin - 2 sup - ports adhesion between DCs and antigen - specific T cells . To evaluate the role of transgelin - 2 in regulating inter - actions between DCs and T cells in the live LN , we per - formed three - dimensional live - imaging of DCs using two - photon microscopy . OVA323 – 339 - pulsed WT or Tagln2 − / − BMDCs labeled with Cell Tracker CMFDA were s . c . injected into the rear footpads of C57BL / 6 mice . At 24 h post - injection , OTII CD4 + T cells labeled with CMRA were i . v . injected ( Fig . 6c ) . As previously observed ( Fig . 3d ) , a significantly smaller number of Tagln2 − / − BMDCs migrated into the LN as compared to WT BMDCs ( Fig . 6c ) . Moreover , T cells formed more stable contacts with WT BMDCs than with Tagln2 − / − BMDCs ( Fig . 6d ) . As a result , the T cell speed in the LN was reduced , and track displacement differences were not significant ( Fig . 6d ) . Collectively , these results demon - strate that transgelin - 2 is essential not only for the deliv - ery of antigen materials through the dynamic movement of DCs but also for maintaining sustained interactions between DCs and T cells for the initiation of adaptive immune responses . Cell‑permeable recombinant transgelin‑2 fused with protein transduction domain ( PTD ) reconstitutes DC functions In a previous report , we demonstrated that cell - perme - able recombinant transgelin - 2 fused with PTD ( TG2P ) enhanced cytotoxic T cell - mediated anticancer activ - ity through increased LFA - 1 avidity [ 17 ] , suggesting that TG2P can compensate for endogenous transgelin - 2 without viral transduction . WT - TG2P was rapidly inter - nalized into the DCs ( Fig . 7a ) . Figure 7b shows a sche - matic of the secondary structure of transgelin - 2 fused with PTD . However , because we expected that natural transgelin - 2 could be degraded by the ubiquitin pathway , as predicted by the program UbiSite [ 33 ] , we substituted the potential ubiquitination site lysine ( K ) 78 with argi - nine ( R ) to generate de - ubiquitinated TG2P ( dU - TG2P ) ( Fig . 7b ) . Interestingly , dU - TG2P ( K78R ) showed remark - able stability and persisted longer than 24 h in the cyto - sol of BMDCs ( Fig . 7c ) . Therefore , we next asked whether dU - TG2P could mimic the actions of transgelin - 2 in Tagln2 − / − BMDCs . To this end , Tagln2 − / − BMDCs were incubated with dU - TG2P ( 10 μM ) for 2 h , and then , the cells were seeded on Fn - coated plates . After 90 min , the size of the BMDCs was determined by flow cytometry , revealing that dU - TG2P significantly increased the size of Tagln2 − / − BMDCs ( Fig . 7d ) . To rule out a potential effect of LPS contamination and to confirm the specific - ity of the recombinant transgelin - 2 , dU - TG2P was heated inactivated ( heat = H , H / dU - TG2P ) , and its effects on Tagln2 − / − BMDCs were examined . Heat inactivation completely abolished the ability of dU - TG2P to increase the size of Tagln2 − / − BMDCs ( Fig . 7d ) , suggesting that the efficacy of dU - TG2P was solely mediated by transge - lin - 2 . dU - TG2P ( 10 μM ) also significantly increased the spreading of Tagln2 − / − BMDCs on Fn , whereas H / dU - TG2P had a little effect as determined by confo - cal microscopy and image analysis ( Fig . 7e ) . Consist - ently , dU - TG2P remarkably increased T cell adhesion to Tagln2 − / − BMDCs in a dose - dependent fashion ( Fig . 7f ) . Further , dU - TG2P - treated Tagln2 − / − BMDCs supported more rapid antigen - specific ( OT - II ) T cell proliferation Fig . 4 Tagln2 − / − DCs do not optimally support T cell activation in vivo . a Schematic diagram of the experimental setup for this figure ( left ) .

J Hematol Oncol ( 2021 ) 14 : 43 and cytokine production than untreated or H / dU - TG2P - treated Tagln2 − / − BMDCs ( Fig . 7g , h ) . dU‑TG2P potentiates DC‑based cancer immunotherapy Although we have previously shown that TG2P could enhance cytotoxic T cell - mediated anticancer activity [ 17 ] , its efficacy may be limited unless a sufficient num - ber of tumor - specific T cell clones are obtained . From this point of view , the amplification of the DC func - tions may be more important because they can gener - ate numerous T cell clones targeting tumor antigens . We therefore asked whether dU - TG2P could promote the efficacy of WT BMDCs , which would prove use - ful for DC - based therapeutic applications . WT BMDCs treated with dU - TG2P exhibited significantly increased spreading on Fn ( Fig . 8a ) . Moreover , dU - TG2P treatment produced increased adhesion between WT BMDCs and activated T cells ( Fig . 8b ) , which stimulated the release of increased levels of T cell cytokines ( Fig . 8c ) . Likewise , a larger number of T cells proliferated with co - cultured dU - TG2P - treated BMDCs than with untreated BMDCs ( Fig . 8d ) . We further asked whether dU - TG2P also could pro - mote the efficacy of WT cDC1s . Similar to the result of WT BMDCs , dU - TG2P increased conjugation between CD8 + OTI T cells and WT cDC1s ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S2A ) . In addition , increased conjugation correlated with the increased cytokine productions ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S2B ) . Accordingly , a larger number of T cells prolifer - ated with co - cultured dU - TG2P - treated cDC1s than with untreated cDC1s ( Additional file 1 : Fig . S2C ) . To evaluate the effects of dU - TG2P - treated BMDCs in the in vivo tumor model , OVA257 – 264 - pulsed untreated BMDCs or dU - TG2P - treated BMDCs were i . v . injected into mice , followed by OVA + B16F10 melanoma cells , as described in Fig . 1g . A significant reduction in metastatic nodules was observed in mice with adoptively trans - ferred OVA257 – 264 - pulsed dU - TG2P - treated BMDCs compared to OVA257 – 264 - pulsed untreated BMDCs ( Fig . 8e ) . Consistent with the metastatic model , dU - TG2P - treated BMDCs significantly suppressed tumor growth in mice ( Fig . 8f ) . Kaplan – Meier survival studies showed that mice injected with OVA257 – 264 - pulsed BMDCs had a median survival time of 43 days and mice adoptively transferred with OVA257 – 264 - pulsed dU - TG2P - treated BMDCs had an 80 % probability of sur - viving longer than 47 days ( Fig . 8g ) . Collectively , these results indicate that dU - TG2P is a promising therapeutic approach for DC - based cancer immunotherapy . Discussion Adaptive cellular immunity is initiated by the presenta - tion of a foreign antigen by DCs to antigen - specific naive T lymphocytes [ 22 ] . In the periphery upon pathogen encounter , immature DCs uptake antigen and proceed through a maturation process during their migration to the draining LNs . All aspects of immature and mature DC functions rely on dynamic rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton , which are regulated by various actin - binding proteins and signaling pathways [ 34 ] . Despite the importance of DC migration from the periphery to the draining LNs , the roles of the numerous actin regula - tory molecules that control this process are incompletely understood . In this study , we showed that transgelin - 2 is a critical actin - binding protein that supports the migra - tion of DCs to the draining LNs and DC - dependent priming of T cells for clonal proliferation , which are important functions for the host defense against foreign invaders and neoplastic diseases . Interestingly , recom - binant transgelin - 2 protein , engineered for cell - penetra - tion and de - ubiquitination , significantly improved the therapeutic activity of WT BMDCs in controlling tumor growth and metastasis in mice . We previously found that transgelin - 2 expression increases in macrophages in response to LPS stimulation [ 19 ] . Among three transgelin family members , transge - lin - 2 is the only isoform that contains an NF - κB con - sensus motif in the 5 ′ promoter region and is expressed in immune cells [ 19 ] , suggesting that this small pro - tein plays a central role in host defenses against infec - tions and neoplastic diseases . We demonstrated that the actin – transgelin - 2 – LFA - 1 axis in cytotoxic CD8 + T cells is effective in potentiating adoptive T cell therapy in cases where cancer cells express ICAM - 1 on their surface ( See figure on next page . ) Fig . 5 Tagln2 − / − DCs did not optimally support T cell activation in vitro . a , c Differentiation ( a ) , activation ( b ) , and cytokine secretion ( c ) of Tagln2 − / − BM cells .

Indeed , LFA - 1 is an essential initiator for the for - mation of the IS between cytotoxic T cells and cancer cells , and it mediates the polarization of cytotoxic gran - ules toward target cells via tight adhesion to the target cells [ 35 ] . However , not all cancer cells express ICAM - 1 [ 17 ] . Moreover , some reports have demonstrated that the expression of ICAM - 1 is positively correlated with a more aggressive tumor phenotype and metastatic poten - tial [ 36 , 37 ] . By contrast , the antitumor functions of DCs are mediated through the initiation of various adaptive immune mechanisms , including clonal expansion of antigen - specific CD4 and CD8 T cells . Thus , improving DC functions represents a more attractive strategy than directly enhancing T cell functions . In this respect , cell - permeable peptides that promote transgelin - 2 - like func - tions in DCs have a potential clinical value as a cancer immunotherapy based on DCs . In some cancer cells , transgelin - 2 is known to inhibit cellular motility by suppressing actin polymerization [ 38 ] . Consistently , transgelin - 2 was found to be more downregulated in metastatic tumors than in primary can - cers [ 38 ] . However , as observed in this study , the reduced migration of Tagln2 − / − BMDCs toward chemokine gra - dients or into the draining LN unambiguously suggests that transgelin - 2 is involved in the dynamic movement of DCs . This conclusion is also corroborated by our previ - ous works , in which transgelin - 2 - KO in T cells or mac - rophages reduced their motility [ 16 , 19 ] . Dynamic actin regulation by transgelin - 2 appears to be mediated by its ability to induce small filopodia - like protrusions at the leading edge of migrating cells and to control podosome formation [ 27 ] . Filopodia and podosomes are impor - tant subcellular architectures that sense the external environment and degrade the ECM during DC migra - tion , respectively [ 27 ] . Moreover , the fact that Tagln2 − / − BMDCs showed a remarkable decrease in F - actin levels suggests that transgelin - 2 is involved in actin polymeri - zation in vivo [ 16 ] . We believe that the reduced F - actin content in transgelin - 2 KO cells is due to the rapid decomposition of polymerized F - actin as this protein directly stabilizes F - actin structures after polymerization but does not increase actin polymerization [ 16 , 18 , 39 ] . In cancer cells , however , these characteristics of transge - lin - 2 may be involved in the process of tumorization in a wide range of cancers [ 14 , 40 ] . In this respect , transge - lin - 2 may be a promising target protein for cancer ther - apy . In fact , several reports using chemical compounds or microRNAs targeting the Tagln2 gene have shown poten - tial positive results in the suppression of cancer devel - opment and metastasis . These interesting features of transgelin - 2 suggest that this small actin - binding protein acts as a double - edged sword in the context of cancer and immune cells . One interesting lingering question is the mechanism by which transgelin - 2 in BMDCs mediates increased T cell adhesion , thereby enhancing T cell clonal proliferation . One possibility is that transgelin - 2 may participate in the growth of small microvilli on the DC surface , and these multiple finger - shaped structures could provide a physi - cal means of clustering adhesion molecules to support T cell adhesion . Interestingly , a previous report demon - strated that DCs can produce multifocal synapses with clustered T cells via microvilli [ 41 ] . These microvilli on the DCs exhibited a high density of antigen - presenting molecules and co - stimulatory molecules , providing the physical basis for the preferential adhesion of both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells [ 41 , 42 ] . Along these lines , Jung et al . and our group recently found that T cell microvilli also provide a platform to cluster important T cell molecules , including TCR , TCR complex , co - receptors , and co - stimulatory molecules [ 43 , 44 ] , suggesting that initial rec - ognition and adhesion are mediated through polarized microvilli between DCs and T cells . DCs are the most potent antigen - presenting cell type and are key players in tumor - specific immune responses . This characteristic has been exploited by DC therapy , in which DCs are loaded with tumor - associated antigens and applied to patients to induce immune responses against tumor antigens . However , although multiple clinical trials have been performed , clinical scores have been largely disappointing . This is due in part to insuf - ficient antigen presentation and T cell activation , migra - tory potential , and cytokine production [ 45 ] . In this regard , accumulating evidence suggests cDC1s—which ( See figure on next page . ) Fig . 7 Recombinant dU‑TG2P reconstitutes Tagln2 − / − DC functions . a The transduction efficiency of WT‑TG2P ( 10 µM ) in WT or Tagln2 − / − DCs . b Schematic diagram of the domain composition of transgelin‑2 .

J Hematol Oncol ( 2021 ) 14 : 43 are different from monocyte - derived DCs—play an inte - gral role in tumor immunity and are a good candidate for vaccination purposes [ 45 ] . In the present study , we found that transgelin - 2 is also induced in Flt3 ligand - induced cDC1s . Moreover , reduction of tumor growth control by Tagln2 − / − cDC1s strongly suggests that transgelin - 2 is an important actin regulator for optimal action of vari - ous DC subsets . Therefore , it will be very interesting to investigate the global gene signatures of WT BMDCs and Tagln2 − / − BMDCs and to compare these with cDC1s . Further , it will be interesting to test whether cell - per - meable transgelin - 2 can change the gene signatures of BMDCs toward the cDC1s . Abnormal changes in the actin cytoskeleton contrib - ute to the growth , metastasis , and invasion of cancer cells . However , because the actin cytoskeleton is indis - pensable for all living cells , drugs that target the actin cytoskeleton of tumor cells may exhibit off - target toxic - ity in noncancerous cells . To overcome this matter , tar - geting actin - regulating factors with altered expression in cancers may become an alternate therapy to increase tumor toxicity . Interestingly , transgelin - 2 is essential for both cancer development and immune functions [ 23 , 40 ] . This suggests that transgelin - 2 can act as a double - edged sword depending on how we apply this protein to cancer therapy . Transgelin - 2 plays an important role in fine - tun - ing the structure and function of the actin cytoskeleton , which is crucial for DC migration , antigen presenta - tion , and the formation of the immune synapse between DCs and T cells . Engineering and clinical application of this protein may unveil a new era in DC - based cancer immunotherapy . Conclusion Adaptive cellular immunity is initiated by a series of actions of DCs that uptake and present foreign antigens , migrate to the draining LNs , and interact with antigen - recognizing T cells . Transgelin - 2 , a 22 kDa actin - bind - ing protein , is upregulated in DCs during maturation and LPS activation . Tagln2 − / − DCs exhibited significant defects in their abilities to home to draining LNs and to form optimal contacts with cognate CD4 + T cells to prime T cells , and these changes were associated with a failure to suppress tumor growth and metastasis of B16F10 melanoma cells in mice . Recombinant transge - lin - 2 protein , engineered for cell - penetration and de - ubiquitination , potentiated DC functions to suppress tumor growth and metastasis , demonstrating that this small - actin binding protein represents a promising thera - peutic approach for DC - based cancer immunotherapy .

Cells B16F10 ( CRL - 6475 ) cell lines were purchased from ATCC . A stable B16F10 cell line expressing membrane - bound OVA ( OVA + B16F10 ) was produced by transient transfection with pCL - neo - mOVA ( Addgene , Cam - bridge , MA ) using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent ( Invit - rogen ) and selection with G418 ( InvivoGen , San Diego , CA , USA ) . For BMDCs cultures , 5 × 10 6 BM cells were cultured in 10 mL of RPMI supplemented with 20 ng / mL recombinant murine GM - CSF for 7 to 9 days . GM - CSF was added every 3 days . To generate cDC1s , 3 × 10 6 BM cells were incubated in 3 mL of RPMI supplemented with 200 ng / mL Flt3 - L for 9 days . Flt3 - L was added every 2 days and cDC1s ( CD11c + B220 − ) were isolated by anti - B220 positive selection beads to exclude plasmacytoid DCs ( CD11C + B220 + ) for further experiments . However , unless otherwise indicated ( for Additional file 1 : Figs . S1 and 2 ) , we used GM - CSF - induced BMDCs for most of the experiments . Naive CD4 + T cells were purified from the mouse spleen and LNs by negative selection using an EasySep magnetic separation system ( Stemcell Tech - nologies , Vancouver , Canada ) . To generate mouse T cell blasts , OTII CD4 + T cells were incubated in 2 µg / mL anti - CD3 / 28 - coated culture plates with 100 U / mL rIL - 2 for 48 h and cultured further for 3 days with 100 U / mL rIL - 2 . Mice C57BL / 6 wi mice and OTII TCR transgenic mice ( C57BL / 6 background ) were purchased from Damul Sci - ence ( Korea ) and Jackson Laboratories ( Bar Harbor , ME , USA ) , respectively . All mice were housed under specific pathogen - free conditions . Transgelin - 2 ( Tagln2 − / − ) KO mice have been described previously [ 16 ] . All experimen - tal methods and protocols were approved by the Institu - tional Animal Care and Use Committee of the School of Life Sciences , Gwangju Institute of Science and Technol - ogy , and carried out in accordance with their approved guidelines ( IACUC GIST - 2015 – 04 ) . Western blotting To analyze transgelin family expression in DCs , BM cells were harvested at the indicated day during differentia - tion with GM - CSF and Flt3L , respectively , and cells were lysed in ice - cold lysis buffer ( 50 mM Tris – HCl , pH 7 . 4 , containing 150 mM NaCl , 1 % Triton X - 100 , and one tab - let of complete protease inhibitors ) for 15 min on ice . Cell lysates were centrifuged at 16 , 000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C , and the supernatants were eluted with sodium dodecyl sulfate ( SDS ) sample buffer ( 100 mM Tris – HCl , pH 6 . 8 , 4 % SDS , and 20 % glycerol with bromophenol blue ) and heated for 5 min . The proteins were separated by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10 % – 15 % gels and were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using a Trans - Blot SD semidry transfer cell ( Bio - Rad , Hercules , CA ) . The membrane was blocked in 5 % skim milk for 1 h , rinsed , and incubated with the appropriate antibod - ies in TBS containing 0 . 1 % Tween 20 ( TBST ) and 0 . 5 % skim milk overnight . Excess primary antibody was then removed by washing the membrane three times in TBST . The membrane was then incubated with 0 . 1 μg / mL per - oxidase - conjugated secondary antibodies ( anti - rabbit or anti - mouse ) for 1 h . After three washes with TBST , bands were visualized using western blotting detection reagents ( EZ - Western Lumi Femto Kit ; DoGenBio , Seoul , South Korea ) and were then exposed to an X - ray film ( Kodak , Rochester , NY ) . Analysis of differentiation and activation of DCs WT or Tagln2 − / − BMDCs ( 1 × 10 6 ) were activated with 200 ng / mL of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) , harvested , and blocked with a rat anti - mouse CD16 / CD32 antibody ( mouse Fc Block , BD Pharmingen ) . Cells were then stained with activation markers , including CD11c , CD80 , CD86 , CD40 , and MHC - II , for flow cytometry . To exam - ine T cell - mediated DC activation in vitro , 1 μg / mL of pOVA ( 323 – 339 ) - pulsed WT or Tagln2 − / − BMDCs ( 1 × 10 5 ) was co - cultured with OTII CD4 + T cells ( 5 × 10 5 ) for 24 h , and the supernatants were subjected to ELISA assay to examine cytokine production . Cell spreading on Fn BMDCs were plated on coverslips coated with or with - out 10 μg / mL of Fn for 90 min . The cells were fixed for 10 min with 4 % paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0 . 1 % Triton - X ( Sigma - Aldrich ) in PBS for 10 min at room temperature ( RT ) . The coverslips were then incubated with TRITC - conjugated phalloidin at RT for 30 min , washed , mounted onto slide glass using Vectash - ield ( VectorLabs , Burlingame , CA ) , and imaged using a FV - 1000 confocal microscope ( Olympus , Tokyo , Japan ) To measure cell spreading area , the captured images were analyzed using ImageJ software ( NIH ) as follows : threshold values were set to define the cell edge , and a mask was then created for each cell to get the total cell area ( with arbitrary units ) within the mask . Cell size was determined by flow cytometry after detachment of the BMDCs with 10 % EDTA . Conjugation assay OTII CD4 + or OTI CD8 + T cells were stained with Cell Tracker Green CMFDA , and WT or Tagln2 − / − BMDCs Page 19 of 23 Kim et al . J Hematol Oncol ( 2021 ) 14 : 43 or Flt3L - induced cDC1s were stained with Cell Tracker Orange CMRA for 30 min . The cells were then washed and resuspended in RPMI 1640 media . For conjuga - tion , DCs were incubated with T cells ( 1 : 5 ratio ) for 2 h in the presence or absence of pOVA ( 323 – 339 , 1 μg / mL ) or pOVA ( 257 – 264 , 1 μg / mL ) . The relative proportion of green , orange , and green and orange - positive events in each tube was determined by FACS Canto ( BD Bio - sciences , San Jose , CA ) and analyzed with FlowJo soft - ware ( Treestar , San Carlos , CA ) . The number of gated events counted per sample was at least 10 , 000 . The per - centage of conjugated T cells was determined as the number of dual - labeled ( green and orange - positive ) events divided by the number of green - positive T cells . Determination of in vitro and in vivo T‑cell activation To examine in vitro T - cell activation , the indicated con - centration of pOVA ( 323 – 339 , 10 − 3 – 10 1 μg / mL ) - pulsed WT or Tagln2 − / − BMDCs ( 1 × 10 5 ) was co - cultured with OTII CD4 + T cells ( 5 × 10 5 ) for 24 h , and the super - natants were subjected to ELISA assay to determine cytokine secretion . In addition , the cells were stained with anti - CD69 or CD25 to determine DC activation . To determine the effects of dU - TG2P , BMDCs or Flt3L - induced cDC1s ( 1 × 10 5 ) were treated with dU - TG2P along with pOVA ( 323 – 339 , 1 μg / mL ) or pOVA ( 257 – 265 , 1 μg / mL ) for 2 h and co - cultured with OTII CD4 + T cells ( 5 × 10 5 ) or OTI CD8 + T cells ( 5 × 10 5 ) for 24 h , and the supernatants were subjected to ELISA assay to deter - mine cytokine secretion . For in vivo T - cell priming , WT or Tagln2 − / − BMDCs ( 3 × 10 6 ) were pulsed with pOVA ( 323 – 339 , 1 μg / mL ) for 2 h and injected s . c . into the footpads of OTII mice , and the cells were isolated from the popliteal lymph node at 24 h post - injection . In gen - eral , to stain the cells with fluorescently conjugated anti - bodies , the cells were blocked with anti - FcγR antibody ( CD16 / 32 , clone 2 . 4G2 ) and then stained for surface acti - vation markers . Data were acquired using a FACS Canto and analyzed with FlowJo software . In vitro migration assay using a Transwell system Transwell cell migration was assayed using a 96 - well Boyden chamber ( ChemoTx plate , Neuroprobe , Inc . , Gaithersburg , MD ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions . The Boyden chamber was assembled with polyvinylpyrrolidone - free polycarbonate filters ( 3 – 5 - µm pore size ) . WT or Tagln2 − / − BMDCs ( 1 × 10 6 ) were added to the Fn - coated upper compartment , and media containing 200 ng / mL of each chemokine were added to the lower compartment . The apparatus was incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in a humidified CO 2 incubator . Cells on the bottom wells were harvested and resuspended in 300 µL of PBS , and the number of cells was counted using a FACS Canto for a fixed period of time ( 300 s ) under con - stant middle pressure . In vivo migration assay To evaluate DC migration , a mixture of 2 × 10 6 WT ( CMFDA - green ) and 2 × 10 6 Tagln2 − / − BMDCs ( CMRA - orange ) was injected into the footpads of WT recipi - ent mice . A popliteal lymph node was harvested at 24 h post - injection . The popliteal LNs were fixed in 4 % para - formaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C overnight . On the next day , the samples were washed and incubated in PBS with 30 % sucrose ( w / v ) ( Sigma - Aldrich ) overnight at 4 °C . The samples were then embedded in Tissue - Tek ® O . C . T . Compound ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) and frozen using 2 - methylbutane , cooled with liquid nitrogen . 10 μm sec - tions were cut using a Leica CM1800 cryostat . For immu - nostaining , tissue sections were blocked for 2 h at RT in 10 % normal goat serum ( Sigma - Aldrich ) . The sections were incubated with fluorescently conjugated anti - B220 antibody at RT for 30 min in 10 % goat normal serum . The samples were washed three times to remove unbound antibody and mounted in Permount solution ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) . Images were acquired with a confo - cal microscope and analyzed with Fluoview software . To quantify the number of migratory DCs , single - cell sus - pensions from the draining popliteal LNs were obtained by digestion in collagenase D , and the % of migrating DCs was quantified using FACS Canto . In some experiments , the excised lymph node was photographed for size deter - mination . Draining popliteal LNs were harvested from the left hind limb , which were injected with cells through the footpad , whereas nondraining LNs were excised from the right hind limb . Immunocytochemistry To analyze the podosome dynamics , BMDCs were har - vested and seeded on poly - L - lysine - coated glass cover - slips in a 12 - well plate ( 2 × 10 6 cells / well in supplemented medium ) and incubated for the indicated time in the presence of 200 ng / mL of LPS at 37 °C and 5 % CO 2 . To analyze the localization of transgelin - 2 , BMDCs were incubated for 24 h in the same condition . Coverslips were washed once with warmed PBS , followed by fixa - tion with 4 % paraformaldehyde in PBS at RT for 10 min . After permeabilization using 0 . 1 % Triton X - 100 , the cells were stained with 10 µg of anti - vinculin and anti - transge - lin - 2 antibodies at 4 °C overnight . The next day , the cov - erslips were washed with PBS two times , and the cells were stained with mouse anti - Alexa647 and rabbit anti - rabbit Alexa488 secondary antibodies . For actin stain - ing , permeabilized cells were incubated with anti - Alexa 647 - or TRITC - conjugated phalloidin ( 1 : 100 ) for 1 h at RT . The coverslips were mounted onto slideglass using Page 20 of 23 Kim et al . J Hematol Oncol ( 2021 ) 14 : 43 Vectashield ( Vector Labs ) and imaged using a confocal microscope . For quantitation of cells with podosomes , the cells were assessed for the presence of at least one clearly identifiable podosome with an F - actin - rich core . At least 100 cells were scored per sample , with a mini - mum of three biological replicates . DC – T cell interactions via intravital two‑photon microscopy For in vivo imaging , pOVA ( 323 – 339 , 1 µg / mL ) - pulsed WT or Tagln2 − / − BMDCs ( 3 × 10 6 ) were stained with Cell Tracker CMFDA - green and injected s . c . into the footpads of WT recipient mice . After 24 h , purified OTII CD4 + T cells were stained with CMRA - orange and adoptively transferred to recipient mice intrave - nously . Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane , and the popliteal LNs were surgically exposed . Imaging was per - formed on a Zeiss LSM 880 microscope equipped with a MaiTai laser ( Coherent ) tuned to 750 nm in combination with an NDD2 BIG2 GaAsP detector and a 20 × water - dipping lens ( NA 1 . 0 , Zeiss ) using ZEN v2 . 1 acquisition software . Images were collected with a typical voxel size of 0 . 593 × 0 . 593 × 1 . 0 μm and a volume dimension of 607 . 28 × 607 . 28 × 200 μm to create a three - dimensional data set . For four - dimensional data sets , images were col - lected with a typical voxel size of 0 . 45 × 0 . 45 × 1 . 5 μm and a volume dimension of 425 . 1 × 425 . 1 × 30 μm . This volume collection was repeated every 60 s for up to 2 h . To analyze the number of DC - contacted T cells and the speed , displacement , and duration of these interactions , tracks were generated for T cells and analyzed using Ima - ris software . Data were plotted using Prism ( GraphPad ) . Time‑lapse video microscopy For the dynamic analysis of DC spreading and protru - sion , time - lapse imaging was conducted on an EVOS system ( EVOS ™ FL Digital Inverted Fluorescence Micro - scope , Fisher Scientific , Paisley , Scotland , UK ) . WT or Tagln2 − / − BMDCs ( 3 × 10 5 ) were seeded on 10 µg / mL of Fn - coated 12 - well non - tissue culture plates for 10 min at 37 °C , and the plates were immediately placed in the chamber of the EVOS unit ( which was programmed to supply 5 % CO 2 and maintained at 37 °C constant temper - ature ) . The cells were recorded in the presence or absence of 200 ng / mL CCL19 every 10 s for up to 1 h . Sequential images were analyzed using ImageJ software . Scanning electron microscopy For scanning EM , cells were fixed with 2 . 5 % glutaral - dehyde solution for 2 h , rinsed with PBS for 5 min , and fixed in OsO 4 for 2 h . The samples were then dehy - drated through incubation with a graded ethanol series over 30 min and dried in a critical point dryer . The samples were prepared by sputter coating with 1 – 2 nm gold – palladium and analyzed using FE - SEM ( HITACHI , Tokyo , Japan ) . B16F10 melanoma tumor model and isolation of TILs To evaluate transgelin - 2 functions in T cells for tumor suppression ( for Fig . 1b ) , PBS ( none ) , WT ( OTI - T ) , KO ( Tagln2 − / − OTI - T ) , or transgelin - 2 - overexpressing T ( TG2OE OTI - T ) cells were adoptively transferred into tumor - bearing C57BL / 6 mice at days 7 , 10 , and 13 post - tumor implantation . All mice were sacrificed at day 25 , and tumors were isolated and weighed . To evaluate the effect of Tagln2 − / − in mice ( for Fig . 1c ) , OVA + B16F10 cells ( 3 × 10 5 ) were s . c . injected into the dorsal flank region of age - and sex - matched WT or Tagln2 − / − mice . To evaluate transgelin - 2 functions in DCs for tumor suppression , BMDCs ( 1 × 10 7 ) from WT or Tagln2 − / − were pulsed with 1 µg / mL of pOVA for 2 h and i . v . injected into 8 - week - old WT mice . At day 7 , OVA + B16F10 cells ( 3 × 10 5 ) were s . c . or i . v . injected into the dorsal flank region to induce solid and metastatic tumor models , respectively . Mice were sacrificed at day 8 post - inoculation with tumor cells . At the end of the experiments , tumors were isolated , weighed , and photo - graphed for gross morphology . To analyze TILs , tumor tissues were dissected and mechanically disaggregated before digestion with collagenase D ( 1 mg / mL , Roche ) for 30 min at 37 °C . After digestion , all of the cells were passed through 70 - µm filters , and leukocytes were iso - lated by centrifugation using 38 % Percoll for 30 min . Pel - lets were resuspended with PBS , stained with anti - CD3 and CD8 antibodies , and analyzed by flow cytometry . To analyze cytokine production , isolated TILs were stimu - lated with PMA / Ionomycin ( 200 nM / 1 µM ) in the pres - ence of Brefeldin A ( 1 µg / mL ) for 4 h at 37 °C . Cells were subsequently collected and stained for CD8 followed by fixation with IC fixation Buffer ( eBioscience ) for 20 to 30 min at RT . Then , the cells were washed twice with 1 × Permeabilization Buffer ( eBioscience ) and stained with IFN - γ antibody . After washing , cells were analyzed by flow cytometry . Generation of OVA‑specific T cells and ex vivo proliferation assay To measure proliferation and cytokine production from OVA - specific T cells , DCs from WT or Tagln2 − / − ( 1 × 10 7 ) were pulsed with 1 µg / mL of pOVA ( 257 – 265 ) for 2 h and i . v . injected into 8 - week - old C57BL / 6 WT mice . At day 7 , CD3 + T cells were isolated from the LNs and spleens , stained with CTV , and co - cultured with 1 µg / mL of pOVA ( 257 – 265 ) - pulsed WT BMDCs for 4 days for clonal expansion . The proliferative CTV - pos - itive cells that were in a live cell gate were quantified by flow cytometry . To measure the IL - 2 or IFN - γ cytokines Page 21 of 23 Kim et al . J Hematol Oncol ( 2021 ) 14 : 43 from OVA - specific T cells , co - cultured supernatants were harvested at 24 h and subjected to ELISA . Generation of dU‑TG2P mutant and purification of recombinant TG2P or dU‑TG2P Recombinant transgelin - 2 protein fused with PTD ( TG2P ) was described previously [ 17 ] . To generate a de - ubiquitinated mutant of TG2P , a potential ubiquitinated amino acid residue was predicted using the program UbiSite [ 33 ] , and the resulting residue , K78 , was mutated to an R by site - directed mutagenesis . The resulting PCR - amplified cDNAs encoding dU - TG2P were ligated into the pET - 28a vector ( Novagen , Madison , WI ) . Expression of recombinant TG2P and dU - TG2P in Escherichia coli BL21 ( DE3 ) cells has been described previously [ 17 ] . Introduction of TG2P ( dU‑TG2P ) into DCs DCs were washed and incubated with 10 μM of TG2P or dU - TG2P for 2 h at 37 °C in serum - free media . The cells were then washed with PBS and resuspended in media for further assays . To rule out the potential for LPS con - tamination , dU - TG2P was heat - inactivated by boiling for 5 min . Proliferation assay OTII CD4 + or OTI CD8 + T cells were stained with CTV and co - cultured with 1 µg / mL of pOVA ( 323 – 339 ) - pulsed BMDCs or pOVA ( 257 – 264 ) - pulsed cDC1s ( 1 × 10 5 ) for 2 , 3 or 5 days . Total cells were fixed with Cell Fixation & Cell Permeabilization Kit ( Thermo Fisher Scientific ) for 1 h at 4 °C and stained with anti - Ki67 along with 1 μL of NucSpot Far - Red for 1 h at 4 °C in the dark . The samples were washed with PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry . The percent of proliferative populations was acquired from the gate in a CTV - positive population . Statistics Student’s t - test and one - way ANOVA analysis of variance ( corrected for all pairwise comparisons ) were performed using Prism software . P - values < 0 . 05 were considered statistically significant .
