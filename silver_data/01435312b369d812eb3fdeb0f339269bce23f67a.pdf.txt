Covid - 19 has redefined airborne transmission Improving indoor ventilation and air quality will help us all to stay safe Julian W Tang , 1 Linsey C Marr , 2 Yuguo Li , 3 Stephanie J Dancer 4 Over a year into the covid - 19 pandemic , we are still debating the role and importance of aerosol transmission for SARS - CoV - 2 , which receives only a cursory mention in some infection control guidelines . 1 2 The confusion has emanated from traditional terminology introduced during the last century . This created poorly defined divisions between “droplet , ” “airborne , ” and “droplet nuclei” transmission , leading to misunderstandings over the physical behaviour of these particles . 3 Essentially , if you can inhaleparticles—regardlessoftheirsizeorname—youarebreathinginaerosols . Although this can happen atlongrange , itismorelikelywhenclosetosomeone , as the aerosols between two people are much more concentrated at short range , rather like being close to someone who is smoking . 4 PeopleinfectedwithSARS - CoV - 2producemanysmall respiratory particles laden with virus as they exhale . Some of these will be inhaled almost immediately by those within a typical conversational “short range” distance ( < 1 m ) , while the remainder disperse over longer distances to be inhaled by others further away ( > 2 m ) . Traditionalists will refer to the larger shortrangeparticlesasdropletsandthesmallerlongrangeparticlesasdropletnuclei , but they are all aerosols because they can be inhaled directly from the air . 5 Why does it matter ? For current infection control purposes , mostofthetimeitdoesn’t . Wearingmasks , keeping your distance , and reducing indoor occupancy all impede the usual routes of transmission , whether through direct contact with surfaces or droplets , or from inhaling aerosols . One crucial difference , however , is the need for added emphasis on ventilation because the tiniest suspended particles can remain airborne for hours , and these constitute an important route of transmission . If we accept that someone in an indoor environment caninhaleenoughvirustocauseinfectionwhenmorethan2mawayfromtheoriginalsource—evenaftertheoriginalsourcehasleft—thenairreplacementoraircleaningmechanismsbecomemuchmoreimportant . 6 7 This means opening windows or installing or upgrading heating , ventilation , and air conditioning systems , as outlined in a recent WHO document . 8 People are much more likely to become infectedinaroomwithwindowsthatcan’tbeopenedorlackinganyventilationsystem . A second crucial implication of airborne spread is that the quality of the mask matters for effective protection against inhaled aerosols . Masks usually impedelargedropletsfromlandingoncoveredareas of the face , and most are at least partially effective against inhalation of aerosols . However , both high filtration efficiency and a good fit are needed to enhance protection against aerosols because tiny airborneparticlescanfindtheirwayaroundanygapsbetweenmaskandface . 9 10 Ifthevirusistransmittedonlythroughlargerparticles ( droplets ) that fall to the ground within a metre or so after exhalation , then mask fit would be less of a concern . Asitis , healthcareworkerswearingsurgical masks have become infected without being involved in aerosol generating procedures . 11 - 13 As airborne spread of SARS - CoV - 2 is fully recognised , our understanding of activities that generate aerosols willrequirefurtherdefinition . Aerosolscientistshave shown that even talking and breathing are aerosol generating procedures . 14 - 16 It is now clear that SARS - CoV - 2 transmits mostly between people at close range through inhalation . Thisdoesnotmeanthattransmissionthroughcontactwithsurfacesorthatthelongerrangeairborneroutedoesnotoccur , but these routes of transmission are lessimportantduringbriefeverydayinteractionsovertheusual1mconversationaldistance . In close range situations , peoplearemuchmorelikelytobeexposed to the virus by inhaling it than by having it fly throughtheairinlargedropletstolandontheireyes , nostrils , or lips . 17 The transmission of SARS - CoV - 2 after touching surfaces is now considered to be relatively minimal . 18 - 20 Improvedindoorairqualitythroughbetterventilationwillbringotherbenefits , includingreducedsickleave for other respiratory viruses and even environmentallyrelatedcomplaintssuchasallergiesandsickbuildingsyndrome . 21 22 Less absenteeism—with its adverse effect on productivity—could save companies significant costs , 23 whichwouldoffsettheexpenseofupgrading their ventilation systems . Newer systems , including aircleaningandfiltrationtechnologies , arebecoming ever more efficient . 24 Covid - 19maywellbecomeseasonal , andwewillhave to live with it as we do with influenza . 25 So governments and health leaders should heed the science and focus their efforts on airborne transmission . Saferindoorenvironmentsarerequired , not only to protect unvaccinated people and those for whom vaccines fail , but also to deter vaccine resistant variants or novel airborne threats that may appearatanytime . Improvingindoorventilationand air quality , particularly in healthcare , work , and educational environments , will help all of us to stay safe , now and in the future .
