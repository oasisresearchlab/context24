The figure refers to Wuhan and includes both the scenario accounting for the estimated susceptibility to infection by age and the scenario where we assume that all individuals are equally susceptible to infection. The distribution of the transmission rate is estimated through the next-generation matrix approach by using 100 bootstrapped contact matrices for the baseline period to obtain the desired \\\\(R_{0}\\\\) values. We then use the estimated distribution of the transmission rate and the bootstrapped outbreak contact matrices to estimate \\\\(R_{0}\\\\) for the outbreak period. The 95% CIs account for the uncertainty on the distribution of the transmission rate, mixing patterns, and susceptibility to infection by age. (**B**) Same as (A), but for Shanghai.
