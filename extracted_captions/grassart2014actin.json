In the first group, which represents 20 of 22 events, we observed that the stable recruitment of dynamic2 happens once clathrin intensity plateaued. We consider this as late recruitment. In the second group, which represents only 2 of 22 events, dynamin2 is recruited during the recruitment phase for clathrin. We refer to these events as early dynamin2 recruitment. Despite this variability, common features can be observed. First, initial dynamin2 recruitment occurs subsequent to genesis of clathrin-coated structures. Second, maximum dynamin2 recruitment is not temporally coupled to maximum clathrin assembly. Third, final dynamin2 departure precedes clathrin departure.
