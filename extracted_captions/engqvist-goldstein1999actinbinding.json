The percentage identity for the two most similar proteins is highlighted in bold. For hHip1R, the cDNA sequence reported by Ishikawa et al. (1998) was used (K1AA 0655 protein; sequence data available from EMBL/N GenBank/D DBJ under accession no. A B 014555). (b) Sequence alignment of the NH2-terminal domain in Sla2-related proteins. Residues that are conserved in at least four proteins are boxed. For hHip1R, residue M 179, designated as the first methionine by Seki et al. (1998), is highlighted in bold. The upstream hHip1R sequence is from Ishikawa et al. (1998). The hHip1 sequence displayed represents a sequence published by K\\\\(\\\\ddot{\\\\rm a}\\\\)lchman et al. (1997) (M 82-A 277), and a recently identified upstream sequence (S1-D 81) (Chopra, V.S., unpublished results). (c) Schematic diagram showing mHip1R domain organization. The three predicted coiled-coil forming domains and the leucine zipper are indicated, as well as the C 00 H-terminal tailn-like domain, and the NH2-terminal domain.
