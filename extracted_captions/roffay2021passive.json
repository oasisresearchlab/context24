(A) In the case of low membrane area buffer, cells have larger initial volumes that remain mostly unchanged during hypotonic shocks. Membrane nuffles are initially unfolded, which leads to higher stretching of the membrane and an increase of PM tension in resting conditions. (B) In the case of intermediate membrane area buffer, cell volumes increase under hypotonic shocks causing the unfolding of membrane nuffles. Membrane stretches and PM tension increases in a cell volume-dependent manner. (C) In the case of high membrane area buffer, cells have smaller initial volume, thus having also more nuffles and therefore call volume increase under hypotonic shocks. Call volume increase during hypotonic shock is responsible for unfolding the nuffles without stretching the membrane to its maximum, therefore having limited increase of PM tension.\\n\\n'"}
