NLRP3 complex was affinity-purified from NLRP3-Flag J774 cells after LPS (100 ng/ml) priming for 4 h and then nigericin (10 mM) stimulation for 0, 5, 15, 40, 60, or 90 min, digested with trypsin and subjected to high-sensitive quantitative MS analysis. MS data was analyzed with Group-DIA and peptide intensities were extracted. The results revealed nine candidate proteins whose amount time-dependently increased in NLRP3 complex. The extracted ion chromatogram (XIC) peaks of multiple product ions of one representative peptide for each of these proteins were shown. Arrows indicate the co-eluting XIC peaks of product ions of corresponding representative peptides. **(B)** GSDMD is involved in inflammasome activation. The genes as indicated were knocked out by CRISPR-Cas9 in RAW-asc cells. The cells were primed with LPS for 4 h and then treated with nigericin for 2 h. The release of p20 caspase-1 into the culture media was measured by immunoblotting using anti-caspase-1 antibody, which was used to assay pyrotosis. **(C)** Time-dependent recruitment of GSDMD and caspase-1 to NLRP3 complex. Relative abundance of NLRP3, caspase-1 and GSDMD proteins in NLRP3 immunoprecomucomplex across six time points was shown. **(D)** Requirement of GSDMD in pyrotosis.
