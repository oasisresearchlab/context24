(Cl Top: Height (red) and stress (black) as a function of time for a representative growing network. The stress was kept constant at a defined setpoint via the feedback mechanism of the AFM (\u201cforce-clamp mode\u201d) until the height change over time appeared linear and the network composition was constant, which means that a steady state in network assembly was reached. The stress was then raised to a higher setpoint, to which the network responded by a rapid adaptation, followed by a new steady state assembly phase. Network growth velocities and densities of components as a function of growth stress were determined from the linear, steady-state phases (grey areas). Bottom: Quantification of average fluorescent intensities for indicated protein components (left) y-axis, colored lines) for networks either subjected to step-wise increasing loads (dark colors, applied stress is shown in the right y-axis (black lines) or adjacent control networks growing in the same chamber in the absence of load (bright colors, see also Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1).

Exponential decay of Arp2/3 fluorescence reflects movement of the fluorophore away from the coverslip driven by actin filament assembly. Some Arp2/3 molecules remain attached to the growing actin network for their entire transit through the TIRF illumination field (blue) whereas others detach from the network while still detectable by TIRF illumination (red). Individual intensity trajectories, therefore, reflect either the transit time through the evanescent field or the time to detachment (dwell time).
