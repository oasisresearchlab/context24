Scale bar, 10 \u03bcm, **g**, Curved adhesions, marked by the colocalizations of \\\\(\\\\text{TFC}\\\\)/6S and \\\\(\\\\text{FCH}\\\\)/2, are abundant on vitronectin fibres in 3D matrices (top), whereas focal adhesions marked by the colocalization of \\\\(\\\\text{TFC}\\\\)/6S and vinculin are sparse (bottom). Scale bar, 10 \u03bcm (full size) or 1 \u03bcm (insets). **h**, Quantification of the number and size of focal adhesions and curved adhesions on 2D flat surfaces and in 3D matrices of vitronectin fibres.
