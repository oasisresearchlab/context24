(A)** Schematic illustrating design features important for genome editing experiments. An N-terminal GFP tagging strategy preceding the first exon of the gene of interest is shown as an example. The location of both crRNA binding sequences is indicated in purple. PAM sequences are indicated in red. The position of the anticipated double strand break generated by each crRNA is indicated with a blue arrow. The donor plasmid contains 1 kb homology arms on either side of the GFP and linker sequence and a bacterial selection sequence in the backbone. The example in the schematic shows successful N-terminal tagging via HDR resulting in the tag and linker being inserted after the endogenous start codon (ATG) in frame with the first exon. (B) Schematic depicting the genome editing process. Transfection includes pre-complexing of the RNP (Cas9/crRNA/tracrRNA) and co-electroporation with the donor plasmid. FACS is used to enrich for GFP-positive cells 3-4 days after transfection. GFP-positive cells are collected and expanded as an enriched population for image-based confirmation of tagging before clonal line generation. (C) Flow cytometry plots displaying GFP intensity (y-axis) 3-4 days after editing. Data shown from several experiments (target locus is indicated), along with control untransfected cells. Gates indicate the population of putatively edited cells and values reflect the percentage of edited cells within the total population. Forward scatter is shown on the x-axis.

In clones where at least one incorrect junction is amplified (purple), the aberrant junction product is larger than expected. These cases are interpreted as possible evidence of plasmid backbone integration at the targeted locus. Clones in which no junctions are amplified (black) are interpreted to contain random integration of the donor plasmid, because the absence of the junction product indicates that the plasmid has no physical association with the target locus. These cases may alternatively represent high levels of transfected plasmid persisting in cells. Clones in which both junctions are correct (yellow) are interpreted to contain duplications of the GFP tag sequence at the targeted locus.\\n\\nAs shown in Fig. 2, amplification of the correct junctional product occurs in 90% of clones confirmed by ddPCR to lack plasmid integration while also containing the GFP tag. By contrast, the majority of clones rejected by ddPCR (45% of total) due to suspected integrated donor plasmid yield incorrect junctional products. We hypothesize that integration of the donor plasmid tends to cause incorrect junctional products and that plasmid incorporation at the site of intended editing is a common byproduct of HDR.

Scale bars are as indicated in the merged panels. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde before imaging. Low magnification images (top row) reveal that sorting significantly enriches the population for mTagRFP-T+ cells, which vary in mTagRFP-T intensity. This pattern was also seen with LMNB1-mEGFP+ sorted cells (Fig. 1E) before clones were selected.\\n\\n'", "SUPP CAPTION TABS1.png": "\"\\n\\n### Table S1. Design features for crRNAs used in editing experiments shown in Fig. 1D.\\n\\nName of the targeted gene (and AICS cell line identifier used in the cell line catalog at Allen Cell Explorer and the Allen Cell Collection at Coriell), crRNA number, HDR efficiency, and binding sequence are shown. Percent HDR was determined by FACS and is shown as a percentage of GFP+ cells within the gated cell population in each experiment. The crRNA used to create the final clone chosen for expansion and distribution for each gene is bolded and underlined. The non-complementary DNA strand corresponding to the crRNA binding site and PAM in the WTC genome is shown in black. The non-complementary DNA strand corresponding to the crRNA binding site in the donor plasmid and PAM is shown in red. Mutations introduced into the donor plasmid to eliminate Cas9 cleavage are indicated by lower case (point mutations), dashes (deletions), or forward slash (where the tag and linker sequence interrupts the crRNA binding site). The distance between the intended insertion site and the PAM -3 site (where double strand breaks are anticipated) is indicated for each crRNA. Distances are negative when the double strand break is anticipated 5' of the insertion site and positive when the double strand break is anticipated 3' of the insertion site relative to gene orientation. Gene orientation and crRNA orientation are defined according to strand in the GRCh38 reference genome. Genomic coordinates are indicated for the site of integration, and for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions or deletions (INDELs) specific to the WTC genome within the homology arm region of the plasmid. In cases where the WTC-specific SNP was heterozygous, the reference genome variant was used in the homology arm. Coordinates are from the GRCh38 (GCA 000001405.15) assembly, NCBI annotation 107. *TUBG1 heterozygous SNP was changed to WTC variant in donor plasmid.\\n\\n\"", "SUPP CAPTION TABS2-1.png": "'\\n\\n**Table S2.** PCR primers used in experiments.\\n\\n'", "SUPP CAPTION TABS2-2.png": "\"All primers are listed in 5' to 3' orientation.\\n\\n\"", "SUPP CAPTION TABS2.png": "''", "SUPP CAPTION TABS3-1.png": "'\\n\\n**Table S3.
