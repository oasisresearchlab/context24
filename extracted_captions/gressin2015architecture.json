In this model, binding of ADF/cofilin to actin cables does not trigger their disassembly, but switches actin filaments (blue filaments) to a pre-diassembly state (red filaments) (top). However, ADF/cofilin has an important effect for the dismantling of branched networks, through its de-branching activity (bottom). For all actin networks, presence of Alp1 turns these stable ADF/cofilin-decorated structures into unstable assemblies, prone to stochastic disassembly. (B) Swarming and disassembly at the single-filament scale. In this model, binding of ADF/cofilin needs to reach a threshold level of 23 molecules to trigger a conformational change of the filaments (represented by a change in their color, from blue to red). At a low concentration of ADF/cofilin (left), the threshold level is not reached.

After fragmentation, ADF/coffin stretches remain near the pointed ends (PO), while barbed ends (BA) remain free to elongate.

In this model, the conformation of actin filaments regulates the activity of Aip1.
