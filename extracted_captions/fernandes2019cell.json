The first box (solid line) shows the region of the cell magnified below it. The second box (dotted line) shows the region depicted in the top view on the right. (_B_) According to the model, a TCR (TCR) is triggered, i.e., phosphorylated because its residence time in the contact is >=2 s. TCR\\\\({}_{2}\\\\) is not triggered because it diffuses out of the contact in less than 2 s. (_C_) Also according to the model, a receptor (TCR) that engages ligand is likely to be held in the contact \u22652 s and become triggered. In \\\\(B\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\), the margins of the contact are marked by the average positions of excluded CD45 molecules (green).

(A) Experimental approach. High-density labeling of CD45 (Gap 8.3 Fab, Alexa Fluor 488) was used to indicate sites of close-contact formation between T cells and a rat CD2-presenting SIs (Ledt), and this was combined with simultaneous low-density labeling of CD45 (Gap 8.3 Fab, Alexa Fluor SBE), Lck (Halo tag, tetramethylrhodamine [TM&]), or TCR (Halo tag, TMR) (right) to enable TIRFM-based single-molecule tracking. (B-D, Left) TERM-based single-molecule tracking of CD45 (B), Lck (C), and TCR (D). Well-separated individual trajectories were recorded for >280 ms and colored according to position in the contact (orange in CD45-rich region and blue in CD45-depleted regions).
