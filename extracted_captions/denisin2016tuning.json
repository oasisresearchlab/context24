(A) We conduct metadata analysis of 25 studies which report gel elastic modulus (\\\\(E\\\\)). The gel formulations are grouped by total acrylamide content (\\\\(T\\\\)) using different colors and the measurement type is represented by circles (\\\\(\\\\blacksquare\\\\)) and triangles (\\\\(\\\\blacktriangle\\\\)) for micro- and macroscale measurements, respectively. We analyze the relationship between cross-linker content (\\\\(C\\\\)) and \\\\(E\\\\) at approximately constant \\\\(T\\\\) in samples with (B) 10.02\\\\(-\\\\)10.6% T, and (C) 20.5\\\\(-\\\\)22% T.\\n\\n'", "CAPTION FIG2.png": "'Figure 2: Relationship between cross-linker concentration and elastic modulus varies for total acrylamide content (\\\\(T\\\\)). Gels containing (A) 10, (B) 15, and (C) 20% total acrylamide exhibit an increase in elastic modulus with increasing cross-linker concentration following a power law up to inflection points at 4, 6, and 8% C, respectively. After the inflection point, the gel modulus decreases with increasing cross-linker. As verification of our characterization method, we also plot gel stiffness reported recently by Wen and colleagues in panel A. Elastic moduli for all samples were calculated using the Hertz (black rectangles, \\\\(\\\\blacksquare\\\\)) fitting approach to microscale force-indentation experiments. The power fit (solid blue line: \\\\(R^{2}=0.91\\\\) for 10% T, 0.95 for 15% T, and 0.98 for 20% T) expected from polymer theory is shown for data points before inflection.
