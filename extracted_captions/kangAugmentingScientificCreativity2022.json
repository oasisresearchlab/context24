We develop Seq2Seq classifiers to classify tokens into purpose, mechanism, or neither, going beyond previous approaches that worked on sentences or relied on crowds. 2 We embed the extracted purpose texts using a pre-trained language model (Google\u2019s USE [20]) and train a tree-based index of vectors to place high semantic similarity vectors in close neighborhoods for efficient lookup. 3 When the user query arrives at the system, it is first embedded with USE. This query embedding is then used to lookup the pre-computed tree indices for high similarity purpose embeddings. Article abstracts for the corresponding purpose embeddings are retrieved from Google Datastore. In the first system, additional human filtering is performed to remove obviously irrelevant results that may have been included due to model errors. Finally, a set of articles with similar purposes to the query but different mechanisms are returned to the users for ideation.\\n\\n'", "CAPTION FIG3.png": "'Fig. 3.
