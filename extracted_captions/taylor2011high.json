The recruited App1-mCherry was identified as an \u201cobject\u201d in segmented images (lower panel). A region of interest (red circle) centred on the scission event (upper panel) was interrogated at each successive frame in the 80 s before and after scission to find whether a segmented object of more than three pixels and >8 s dwell time was present at the site of scission or not. Frames in which an object was detected were scored \u20181\u201d, and \u20180\u201d otherwise. The filtering thresholds were set using mCherry as a negative control, which scored a peak detection probability of 0.013, wherein residual detection of mCherry \u201cobjects\u201d was due to detector noise. (B) The analysis was repeated for all events and the average scores calculated to yield a time-resolved profile representing the \u201cprobability of object detection\u201d at a given frame relative to scission. (C) The analysis was repeated for all the tagged endocytic proteins, which were ranked by probability of detection and colour coded according to the module membership (as defined in Figure 4).

A simplified schematic illustrating the relative timing of recruitment of the seven different endocytic protein modules to sites of scission, highlighting some unexpected findings for future investigation. The patterns of recruitment are the same for terminal events (Aii) and non-terminal events (Aii). The heterogeneous size of endocytically productive CCSs is most easily explained if clathrin-coated buds formed at the edges of clathrin patches of variable size, thus accounting for the variability in fluorescence of endocytically reactive CCSs (Aii). Repeat scission events most likely occurred by re-growth of clathrin-coated invaginations at the edge of \u201chost\u201d patches of clathrin (flower curved arrow, [Aii]).\\n\\n'"}
