This suggests that dynamic is not involved in the initial entry step but affects early compartments on route to the Golgi complex. It also provides further evidence for a nonexwolce, nonclathrin pathway as DynK44A inhibits both clathrin- and Cav1-dependent endocytosis.

In the case of caveolae, it is a considerable problem to distinguish between structures connected to the extracellular media and internal structures because caveolae and groups of caveolae can be connected to the cell surface by very narrow nacks (Porten et al., 1994). These nacks could exclude pretenaceous extracellular markers, as is the case for deeply invagorated clathrin-coated pits (Schmidt and Smythe, 1991). To prevent labeling of externally connected structures, we used the reducing agent ascorbic acid (AA) to quench the HRP-DAB reaction product on an extracellular surface (Sborovgogl et al., 1996). This necessitates carrying out the DAB reaction on cells before fixation. WT MEFs were labeled with CTB-HRP on ice, and then the HRP reaction was performed immediately or after warming to 37\u00b0C for 2.5 or 30 min. In each case, the DAB reaction was performed on ice in the presence or absence of ascorbic acid (=AA) and subsequently fixed and processed for EM. In addition, we optimized conditions to allow immunogold labeling of the CTB-HRP-labeled elements so that individual structures could be identified as surface connected or internal and identified using well-defined markers such as Cav1 and dynamin. [A] Cells maintained at 4\u00b0C and DAB reacted in the absence of AA [-AA] show an electron-dense layer of reaction product over the entire cell surface [a and b], including clearly surface-connected caveolae and putative caveolae structure that appear to be some disconnects from the PM but are obviously surface connected outside the plane of section [b]. The morphology was similar to that seen in cells in which the DAB reaction was performed after fixation [standard conditions; see Fig. S2). In the presence of AA [+AA] staining was completely abolished [c\u2013b], indicating that the AA is able to efficiently quench the surface reaction product even in deeply invagorated structures (e and f]. [B] WT MEFs were warmed to 37\u00b0C for 30 min and stained in the presence or absence of AA. Staining can be seen in putative endosomal structures and the Golgi [G] in both samples, although cells processed in the presence of AA show no surface labeling [compare to d [-C] for examine the non-surface-connected carriers involved in the earliest stages of CTB-HRP uptake, WT MEFs internalized CTB-HRP for 2.5 min at 37\u00b0C, and were DAB treated in the presence of AA to remove surface reaction. Note that structures within 50 nm from the surface show CTB-HRP/DAB staining but are clearly not surface connected. Thus, this method can be used to identify and characterize budding all intermediates in the CTB entry pathway for the first time. [D] A second method for sample preparation was also used in which cells were not sectioned after processing but were prepared as whole mount specimens using a modification of the method described previously (Stoovvagel et al., 1996). WT MEFs were grown on EM grids, which had internalized CTB-HRP for 5 min at 37\u00b0C. Cells were treated with DAB in the presence of AA. This method allowed the call pariphery to be observed without sectioning, and so facilitated the visualization of complex structures in three dimensions. When compared to C, similar structures observed in the section are observed in the whole mount calls. Bars: [Aa, Ac, Ba, and Bc] 1 mm; [Ab, Ad, Bb, Bd, C, and D] 500 nm; [Aa and Af] 100 nm.\\n\\n'"}
