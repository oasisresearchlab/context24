(A to F) The interface side of the 40S ribosomal subunit is depicted with Met-tRNA\\\\({}_{\\\\text{b}}^{\\\\text{Met}}\\\\) bound to eIF2 and GTP in the TC and base paired with UUG or AUG triplets in the ribosomal P site. The bulk of eIF3 is bound to the solvent side of the 40S subunit and only the NIP1-NTD and TIF32-CTD are visible as they gain access to the interface side of the ribosome. eIF5 is bound to the NIP1-NTD and to eIF2, and the TIF32-CTD contacts eIF2 directly, as shown in Fig. 1A. The eIF1 has been released from its interactions with NIP1-NTD and TIF32-CTD and is bound near the P site to eIF5. (A) In WT cells, base pairing of tRNA\\\\({}_{\\\\text{b}}^{\\\\text{Met}}\\\\) with UUG during scanning (upper schematic) does not elicit GTP hydrolysis by the TC because eIF1 senses the imperfect codon-anticodon interaction and inhibits the GTPase activating function of eIF5. Scanning continues and, upon base pairing of tRNA\\\\({}_{\\\\text{b}}^{\\\\text{Met}}\\\\) with AUG (lower schematic), the negative regulation of eIF5 by eIF1 is disabled to permit eIF5-stimulated GTP hydrolysis, release of eIF2-GDP and other eIFs, and joining of the 60S subunit to form an 80S initiation complex. (B) In _suil-1_ cells, eIF1 does not bind effectively to 40S subunits, which decreases its ability to inhibit eIF5 GAP function and allows increased rates of GTP hydrolysis and initiation at a UUG codon (Sui\\\\({}^{-}\\\\) phenotype). (C) The _NIP1-Box2_ mutation partially suppresses the Sui\\\\({}^{-}\\\\) phenotype in _suil-1_ cells by disrupting a contact between eIF5 and the NIP1-NTD, thus leading to a weaker association of eIF5 with the preinitiation complex and attendant reduction in its GAP function. This partially compensates for the increased rate of GTP hydrolysis at UUG codons produced by _suil-1_, yielding an Sui\\\\({}^{-}\\\\) phenotype. The compound defects in binding of eIF1 and eIF5 to the 40S ribosome in the _suil-1 NIP1-Box2-His_ double mutant dramatically decreases the rate of translation initiation at AUG codons and produces a severe growth defect. (D) _NIP1-Box21_ leads to increased GTP hydrolysis by the TC at UUG triplets by altering the interaction of eIF5 with the 40S ribosome and thereby reducing the ability of eIF1 to interact with eIF5 in the manner required to inhibit its GAP function at UUG codons (Sui\\\\({}^{-}\\\\) phenotype). Overexpression of eIF1 can restore, by mass action, the interaction between eIF1 and eIF needed to prevent GTP hydrolysis at UUG codons and suppresses the Sui\\\\({}^{-}\\\\) phenotype of _NIP1-Box12_ (not depicted). (E) The _TIF5-G3IR_ allele encodes a hyperactive form of eIF5 that escapes strong inhibition of its GAP function by eIF1 at UUG codons (Sui\\\\({}^{-}\\\\) phenotype). (F) _NIP1-Box6R_ suppresses the Sui\\\\({}^{-}\\\\) phenotype of _TIF5-G31R_ by weakening the interaction of eIF5 with the NIP1-NTD, leading to reduced association of eIF5 with the 40S ribosome and diminishing the GAP function of eIF5. This offsets the increased rate of GTP hydrolysis at UUG codons produced by _TIF5-G31R_ and results in a Su\\\\({}^{-}\\\\) phenotype. (G) The _NIP1-Box6R_ and _-Box15_ mutations weaken the association of TC with the MFC and thus decrease the rate of TC binding to 40S subunits scanning downstream from uORF1 in the _GCN4_ mRNA leader. This allows a fraction of 40S subunits to bypass uORF4 and reinitiate at _GCN4_ instead of reinitiating at uORF4 and dissociating from the mRNA, even in the absence of eIF2a phosphorylation in _gcn2_ cells, where TC levels are high (Gcd\\\\({}^{-}\\\\) phenotype).\\n\\n'", "CAPTION TAB1.png": "'TABLE 1: Yeast strains used in this study '", "CAPTION TAB2.png": "'\\n\\n**TABLE 2.** Example used in this study.\\n\\n'", "CAPTION TAB3.png": "'\\n\\n\\\\begin{table}\\n\\\\begin{tabular}{l l'"}
