(_P_) In the expansion phase of membrane bleibbing, Rnd3 and p1968\u2013Rho-GAP inhibit the activation of RhoA. As the protruded membrane areas become enlarged, the relative concentration of Rnd3 decreases. Sporadic activation of RhoA leads to ROCK phosphorylation of Rnd3 and removal of p1968\u2013Rho-GAP from the membrane. Thus, RhoA activation is amplified and sustained by the positive-feedback loop. ROCK also phosphorylates earin and activated earin recruits, which leads to reassembly of the actin cortex.\\n\\n'"}
