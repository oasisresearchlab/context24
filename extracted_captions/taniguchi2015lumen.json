Fifty multi-cell clones were counted per independent replicate (total of 150 clones in three experiments). Mean values with 5D are plotted. (B-E) cysts were grown in 3D culture for 3 days; phalloidin (green) stains F-ACTIN. (B) \u03b1-TUBULIN immunostaining (red) shows microtubule localization.

Two distinct phenotypes are seen in the presence of 10 uM for Y-27632: clones without a central EERIN accumulation (no lumen) and clones with EERIN accumulation at the AMIS (lumen). Cells treated with blebbistatin exhibit lumens, but treatment with SMIFH2 (+10 uM Y) or CK-666 (+10 uM Y) reduces lumen size.\\n\\n(B) Comparison of AMIS formation in hESCs at the two-cell stage in the presence of graded concentrations of Y-27632 (ROCK inhibitor) on blebbistatin (MYOSIN-II inhibitor). Statistical differences are indicated in black for Y-27632 and in red for blebbistatin. Consistent with recent studies, blebbistatin treatment alone rescues dissociation-mediated cell death (Ohgushi et al., 2010).\\n\\n(C) hESCs were treated with graded concentrations of the formin inhibitor, SMIFH2. Quantitation of AMIS formation at the two-cell stage is shown. Y-27632 was added to hESC cultures to prevent cell death.\\n\\n(D) Quantitation of the size (area) of the Exrin\\\\({}^{*}\\\\) AMIS in H9 clones treated with the indicated small molecules. For each quantitation, four independent sets of 15 individual two-cell clones, treated with the indicated small molecules or experimental control (treated only with Y-27632), were imaged. Images of individual clones, focused at the plane with the largest lumen, were analyzed in ImageJ to determine the surface area of the AMIS. Average of log\\\\({}_{2}\\\\) of normalized value (surface area of small-molecule-treated clones divided by surface area of '", "CAPTION FIG4-2.png": "\"control clones) from four independent replicates are plotted.

Quantitation of lumen formation at the two-cell stage is shown. Student's test was performed to assess differences in lumen formation at different concentrations of all inhibitors; 2.5 mM was used as the baseline for Y-27632 and blebbistatin in (B), while DMSO was used as the baseline for (C) and (G). The Student's test was utilized for statistical analysis: ns = p > 0.05; *P <= 0.05; *P <= 0.01, and ***p <= 0.001. For all images, blue indicates DMA staining (DAPI). For small-molecule quantitation in (B), (C), and (G), 50 two-cell clones were counted per independent sample (total of 150 for the three samples) for each concentration. Error bars indicate 5D.\\n\\n(H) Proposed model for lumenogenesis in hESC and the role of RHO- and RAC-dependent actin polymerization is shown. Lumenogenesis is promoted by inhibition of ROCK-MYOSIN-II signaling (decreased contraction of the actin network), activation of MDIA1 (increased actin nucleation and extension), and activation of RAC-ARP2/3 (increased actin meshwork formation).\\n\\nScale bars represents 10 mm in (A) and (F).\\n\\n\"", "CAPTION FIG4.png": "''"}
