Kaplan-Meier cumulative incidence of the second cases with respect to the incubation period (\\\\(A\\\\)) and serial interval (\\\\(\\\\beta\\\\)) is shown with black lines, with a plot of estimates of the cumulative distribution function of log-normal distributions fit to the data represented by thick cyan and magenta lines respectively, along with 10 000 parametric bootstrapped sample estimates of the cumulative distribution function depicted by cyan and magenta shading, respectively. Horizontal lines indicate the 95% CIs for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles of these fitted distributions. Estimated median incubation period at COVID-13 was 4.3 days (95% CI: 3.4\u20135.3 days), with symptoms developing in 95% of the infected persons by 15.3 days (95% CI: 10.4\u201321.1 days) and in 5% by 1.2 days (95% CI: .76\u20131.8). Estimate of the dispersion parameter was 2.2 (95% CI: 1.8\u20132.5), and the estimated mean incubation period was 5.8 days. Accordingly, the serial interval of household secondary cases was estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI: 4.3\u20136.2 days); distributions that were fit to the observed data implied that the serial interval was <14.8 days in 95% of cases (95% CI: 11\u201319.2 days) and <1.8 days in 5% of cases (95% CI: 1.4\u20132.4 days). Estimate of the dispersion parameter was 1.9 (95% CI: 1.65\u20132.2), and the estimated mean serial interval was 6.3 days.
