{"CAPTION FIG1.png": "\"\\n\\n**Fig. 1. Novelty and conventionality in science**. For a sample paper, (**A**) shows the distribution of \\\\(z\\\\) scores for that paper's journal pairings. The \\\\(z\\\\) score shows how common a journal pairing is as compared to chance. For each paper, we take two summary measures its median \\\\(z\\\\) score, capturing the paper's central tendency in combining prior work, and the 10th-percertile \\\\(z\\\\) score, capturing the paper's journal pairings that are relatively unusual. For the population of papers, we then consider these values across all papers in the WOS published in the 1980s or 1990s. (**B**) considers the median \\\\(z\\\\) scores and shows that the vast majority of papers displays a high propensity for conventionality; in the 1980s and 1990s, fewer than 4% of papers have median \\\\(z\\\\) scores below 0 and more than 50% of papers have median \\\\(z\\\\) scores above 64. (**C**) considers the 10th-percertile \\\\(z\\\\) scores, which further suggest a propensity for conventionality; only 41% of papers in the 1980s and 1990s have a 10th-percertile \\\\(z\\\\) score below 0. Overall, by these measures, science rarely draws on atypical pairings of prior work.\\n\\n\"", "CAPTION FIG2.png": "'\\n\\n**Fig. 2. The probability of a \"hit\" paper, conditional on novelty and conventionality.** This figure represents the probability of a paper being in the top 5% of the citation distribution conditional on two dimensions: whether a paper exhibits (i) high or low median conventionality and (ii) high or low tail novelty, as defined in the text. Papers that combine high median conventionality and high tail novelty are hits in 9.11 out of 100 papers, a rate nearly double the background rate of 5%. Papers that are high on one dimension only (high median conventionality or high tail novelty but not both) have hit rates about half as large. Papers with low median conventionality and low tail novelty have hit rates of only 2.05 out of 100 papers. The sample includes all papers published in the WOS from 1990 to 2000. The supplementary materials show similar findings when considering (i) all other decades from 1950 to 2000; (ii) hit papers defined as the top **1** or 10% by citations; and (iii) analyses controlling for field and other observable differences across papers, hinting at auniversality of these relationships for scientific work. The difference in the hit probabilities for each category is statistically significant (\\\\(P<0.00001\\\\)). The percentage of WOS papers in each category are: 6.7% (green bar), 23% (gold bar), 26% (red bar), and 44% (blue bar).\\n\\n'", "CAPTION FIG3.png": "\"distinct (solo versus pair \\\\(P=0.016\\\\), pair versus team \\\\(P=0.001\\\\), team versus solo \\\\(P<0.001\\\\)).
