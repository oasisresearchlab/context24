Cell spreading and focal adhesion maturation on tissue culture polystyrene is abrogated when cultures are performed on softer fibronectin-coated PDMS 10: 1 and fibronectin-coated PDMS 40: 1. Increased internalization of particles was observed for cells on more mechanically compliant substrates. (B) Transmission electron micrograph of silica nanoparticles (d_TSM_ = 120 nm). Corrected time course dynamic light scattering measurements performed in water and supplemented RPMI at 0 h and 6 h indicate particle stability.
