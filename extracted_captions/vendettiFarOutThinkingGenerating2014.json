Participants were shown both scenes at the same time. After 10 s, one of the objects in the top scene was highlighted (here, the umbrella), and participants had to indicate which object in the bottom scene \"goes with\" the highlighted object in the top scene. For each pair of scenes, the botoon picture included both a potential feaural match (here, the umbrella over the coffee stand) and a potential relational match (here, the newspaper the woman is holding over her head, which performs a function similar to the umbrella\\'s in the top scene).\\n\\n'", "CAPTION FIG2.png": "'Figure 2: Results from Experiment 1a and Experiment 1b: mean proportion of relational objects chosen in the picture-mapping task as a function of the semantic distance between word pairs in the verbal analogy task.
