For this, STxB was covalently linked to biotin, via a cleavable disulphide bond. After binding to cells at 4\u00b0C, the cells were shifted to 37\u00b0C for the indicated periods of time, before being placed on ice again. The use of the membrane-impemaneable reducing agent sodium-2-mercapto-ethanesulfonic acid (MESNA) then allowed differentiating cell surface inaccessable STxB (MESNA-protected) from total STxB (no MESNA treatment). The quantification of biotinylated STxB was achieved by ELISA on plates coated with anti-STxB antibody (130C and using streptavidin-HRP. STxB entry into control cells was highly efficient at 37\u00b0C (O), and was totally abolished at 4\u00b0C (O).

The cells were then shifted to 4\u00b0C, treated with MESNA, fixed, and viewed by confocal microscopy.

In Figure 1D, we show that on energy-depleted cells, biotinylated STxB is completely MESNA accessible upon treatment at 37\u00b0C, in order to results obtained upon MESNA treatments at 4\u00b0C or at 19.5\u00b0C. A trivial explanation would not that MESNA gain access by fluid phase uptake to biotin/ylated STxB in endosomes. The following experiment was designed to analyze this point. Biotinylated STxB was bound to the plasma membrane of non-energy-depleted HeLa cells for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The cells were then shifted for 10 min to 37\u00b0C (STxB entry into endosomes), placed on ice again (endocytosis is terminated), and STxB that remained at the plasma membrane was quenched by MESNA treatment for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. The cells were then energy-depleted at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. At this point, biotinylated STxB was in endosomes of energy-depleted cells. In a final incubation with MESNA for 30 min at 37\u00b0C for was tested whether the endosomal biotinylated STxB could be reached by fluid phase in the centrifuged presence of the energy-depletion cocktail. In MESNA-treated (F) and nontreated (G) cells, a polyclonal antibody against STxB was used to show that STxB was trapped in endosomes (colabeling with transferrin receptor). StxB, the similar labeling intensities with fluorophore-tagged streptavidin that were observed in both conditions indicated that MESNA could not access biotin-tagged STxB in endosomes of energy-depleted cells.\\n\\n(H) The uptake into cells of biotinylated STxB or transferrin (TI) was measured while dynamin activity was inhibited by treatment of cells with 80 \u03bcM d/nascore.

(A-C) The green arrow (B) indicates the site of scission of the STxB tubule 5.5 min after washout of energy poisons in the absence of Lattruculin B. At this time point, GP values of the STxB tube have already dropped, suggesting that membrane reorganization precedes scission. (D-F) After washout of energy poisons in the presence of Lattruculin B, the STxB tubule did not undergo scission and GP values remained stable.\\n\\n'", "SUPP CAPTION FIGS7.png": "\"Figure S7: Scission of STxB-Induced Tubules Occurs Only When Actin Is Allowed to Polymericize on Membranes, Related to Figure 7\\n\\nTable scission on liposomes composed of egg phosphatidyl choline, erythrocyte GB3 (5 mol%), cholesterol (15 mol%), and DOGS-NTA-NL (5 mol%) is triggered by polymerization of actin on the membrane (see Figure 7). In the absence of VPCA and Arp2/3 that provide the actin link with the membrane (A and condition 2' in B and C), no tubule scission was observed. Conditions 2 and 3 were the same as in Figure 7. In(B), respectively 83, 79, and 14% of the liposomes display tubules attached to the membrane in conditions 2, 2\u2032, and 3 (n = 29, 14, and 29, respectively).
