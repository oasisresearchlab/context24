{"CAPTION FIG1.png": "'\\nFig. 1: **Structural basis for cooperativity observed in multiple-antibody cocktails. a** SFR-based analysis of the competitive binding of three-antibody cocktail. **b** Binding affinities of HB27 prior to (right) or after (left) partial saturation of H014 to SARS-CoV-2 5 trimer. **c**, **d** Orthogonal views of SARS-CoV-2 5 trimer in complex with the 3- mAb **(c)** and 4- mAb cocktails **(d)**. The 51 and 52 regions are labeled. The triangular exterior of the 5 trimer by nine copies of Fab molecules and the triangular interior on the top of 52 are marked by triangle and circle. **e** The variational alterations of RBD and NTD driven by different binding patterns. **f** Top views of four possible conformations of SARS-CoV-2 5 in complex with H014 (upper panel) or the mixture of H014 and HB27 (lower panel). Left to right, 5 trimers with 0\u20133 open RBDs. H014 and HB27 Fab molecules are outlined by bright colored lines. Two different binding patterns of either H014 or HB27 to the open RBDs are analyzed and marked by \u201cOR\u201d.\\n\\n'"}
