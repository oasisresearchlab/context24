The maximum-likelihood estimation for the parametric distribution of the cumulative distribution function as shown, along with 1050 parametric bootstrap estimates of the cumulative distribution function. Panel A shows estimates of the proportion of cases who are confirmed by RT-PCR, according to the number of days after symptom onset. We estimated that 55% of cases detected through symptom-based surveillance were confirmed by RT-PCR within 4 6 days (55% Cl 4.2-5 4) after symptom onset, and 95% were confirmed by RT-PCR within 12 7 days (11.5-13 8) after symptom onset. Contact-based surveillance reduced the day from symptom onset to RT-PCR confirmation to 4.9 days (35% Cl 2.6-3 4) in 55% of cases and to 5.6 days (5.3-3-5) in 55% of cases. Panel B shows estimates of the proportion of cases who were admitted to hospital, according to the number of days after symptom onset. We estimated that 50% of the cases detected through symptom-based surveillance were identified to hospital by 3.4 days (95% Cl 3.1-3-5) after symptom onset, and 95% by 12.4 days (10.9-13 3). Contact-based surveillance reduced the day from symptom onset to hospital admission to 2.1 days (95% Cl 1.7-3-5) in 55% of cases, and 6.0 days (95% Cl 4.5-7-5) in 95% of cases. Panel C shows estimates of the proportion of cases detected through symptom onset. The proportion of cases included, according to number of days after symptoms onset. We estimated that 50% of cases detected through symptom onset, and 95% by 12.4 days (10.9-13 3).
