At the boundary of Ac1/Ac0, the ID-ID and OD-ID intrastrand interactions between the actin subunits (Fig. S3, blue and red arrows, respectively) remain because there was no significant structural change inside the ID of Ac1 (C-form) from the F-form and because Ac0 is in the F-form. **c** Model of Cot2 binding to the Gi-site of Ac3 in **b**'", "CAPTION FIG7.png": "'Figure 7: Model for severing.

The intrasrand actin-actin contact is represented by a pair _of_ thick blue lines, one for the ID-ID interactions and the other for the OD-ID interactions. The interstrand actin-actin contacts are also represented by thick blue lines. **b** Upon binding of the first ccfilin molecule (orange oval) to one strand of the F-actin, two actin subunits undergo conformational transition into the C-form (camel), which is associated with a twist change in the actin strand, and therefore charges in relative positions of subunits. We assume that these positional charges weaken the interstrand contacts, as indicated by the thin gray lines. **c** The second ccfilin binds next to the first ccfilin on the same actin strand. Collision occurs between the strands, as indicated by an \u201cX\u201d. Accumulated position mismatches between actin subunits with and without bound ccfilin may require adapter subunits at either boundary (gray). **d** As the size of the ccfilin-bound section in the ccfilin-bound strand increases, the helical twist transition propagates to the opposite strand. At this stage, the strain accumulated in the ccfilin-bound strand and between the strands would be relieved. The ccfilin-free actin subunits with the ccfilactin helical twist are represented in magenta. The P-end boundary of the section is a candidate for severing (red arrows). **e** The helical twist change in the ccfilin-free strand facilitates the binding of ccfilin molecules to the strand, forming a double-stranded ccfilin-bound cluster. The potential severing site remains (red arrows). Orange lines represent the interstrand interactions in ccfilation (Fig. 3e). **f** When another ccfilin joins at the boundary of the ccfilin cluster before severing, the ccfilin cluster grows.
