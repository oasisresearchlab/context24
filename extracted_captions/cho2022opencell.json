The adjusted Rand index (ARI (88)) of clusters relative to three ground-truth datasets is plotted as a function of the Leiden clustering resolution. ARI [a metric between 0 and 1 (21)] measures how well the groups from a given partition (in our case, the groups of proteins delineated at different clustering resolutions) match groups defined in a reference set. The amplitude of the ARI curves is approximately equal to the number of pairs of elements that partition similarly between sets; the resolution at which each curve reaches its maximum corresponds to the resolution that best captures the information in each ground-truth dataset.
