Here, IRSp53 may be recruited by its I-BAR domain in the absence of GTP-CDC42, keeping its SH3 domain in an intra-molecular inhibited state. PICKI keeps ARP2/3 in an inactive state. **b** Phase II: Characterised by the recruitment of CDC42 and a sharp increase in ARFI leading to the removal of PICXI. This allows for the activation of ARP2/3 and buildup of F-actin. CDC42 binds to the CRIB domain of IRSp53 thereby activating it. The SH3 domain of IRSp53 can now bind to ARP2/3 activators and create F-actin. **c** Phase II: Characterised by endocytic vesicle formation, the presence of CDC42, ARFI/GBF1 and F-actin'", "CAPTION TAB1.png": "'\\n\\n**Table 1 pH pulsing assay data set**'", "CAPTION TAB2.png": "'\\n\\n**Table 2 Cross-correlation calculated for indicated traces**'"}
