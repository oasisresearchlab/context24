{"CAPTION FIG1.png": "'Figure 1: I/LWEQ module superfamily. (A) Representative I/LWEQ module proteins and their similar modular organization. The C-terminal I/LWEQ module, which contains the primary actin-binding site of I/LWEQ module proteins, defines the I/LWEQ module superfamily. The E/ANTH domain of Sla2p. Hip1, and Hip12 (Hip1R) is found in proteins that participate in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The FERM domain specifies plasma membrane localization in a variety of proteins, including Talin1 and Talin2. (B) Conserved features of the I/LWEQ module. The conserved organization of Blocks 1\\\\(-\\\\)4 is shown (gray) along with the putative a-helices (h1\\\\(-\\\\)h5, black) that are substantially coextensive with Blocks 1\\\\(-\\\\)4. Conserved residues near the beginning of Blocks 1\\\\(-\\\\)4 are indicated ([I/L, W, E, and Q). The N-terminal, upstream a-helix (USH) is found in all I/LWEQ module proteins (shadowed). The a-helical nature of the I/LWEQ module has been confirmed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. Recombinant I/LWEQ module proteins (\\\\(\\\\pm\\\\)H) and the Talin1 USB are described in the table with reference to their amino acid sequences (GenBank accession numbers 075146 for 075146 and 000291 for 000291; human Talin1 and Talin2 cDNA sequences have been submitted to GenBank). (C) USB sequence alignment Amino acid sequences N-terminal to the I/LWEQ module of Talin1/2, TalA, Hip1/12, and Sla2p were aligned using CLUSTAL W (69). The structurally conserved USH (shadowed) and the beginning of Block 1 of the I/LWEQ module are shown. The first amino acid of the (\\\\(\\\\div\\\\)H) recombinant proteins is noted with an arrowhead. Conserved amino acids are highlighted in gray. The filled circle and black shading indicate the only invariant amino acid in the USH.\\n\\n'", "CAPTION FIG2.png": "'Figure 2: Talini F-actin binding. (A) F-Actin cosedimentation assays. Muscle (a) or non-muscle (\\\\(\\\\beta\\\\)) actin (\\\\(0-25\\\\)\\\\(\\\\mu\\\\)M) was mixed with I/LWEQ module Talini (\\\\(-\\\\)H), I/LWEQ module Talini1 with the USH (\\\\(+\\\\)H), GST, or the Talini1 USH (\\\\(2.0\\\\)\\\\(\\\\mu\\\\)M each) in buffer A [2 mM Tris (pH 8), 0.2 mM CaCl2, 0.2 mM ATP, and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol] in a total volume of 50 \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\)L. Actin polymerization was induced by addition of 2 mM MgCl2 and 50 mM KCl and allowed to proceed for 60 min at 22 \u00b0C. Following centrifugation at 160000g and 22 \u00b0C for 20 min, the supernatant and pellet fractions were separated and F-actin cosedimentation was analyzed by SDS\\\\(-\\\\)PAGE. The USH actin binding panels were silver-stained; the others were stained with Coomassie Blue. (B) Quantitative analysis of actin binding. The percent bound, as a measure of cosedimentation of Talini (\\\\(\\\\pm\\\\)H) with GST as a negative control, was determined densitometrically using the polyacrylamide gels shown in panel A. The binding data were fit using Kaleidagraph. R values for the curve fits ranged from 0.999 to 0.943. (C) Data analysis. Binding curves were transformed and analyzed by linear regression (GraphPad Prism, version 4) to calculate the dissociation constant of Talini (\\\\(\\\\pm\\\\)H) for filamentous \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\)- and \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\)-actin. Dissociation constants are listed in Table 1. Each data point is the average of at least two but not more than four independent experiments. (D) F-Actin:I/LWEQ module stoichiometry. The stoichiometry for the interaction of the Talin-1 I/LWEQ module and F-actin was determined as described previously (34) in cosedimentation assays in which the \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\)-actin concentration was kept constant at 3.0 \\\\(\\\\mu\\\\)M while increasing amounts of I/LWEQ module Talini1 (\\\\(0-15\\\\)\\\\(\\\\mu\\\\)M) were added after actin polymerization.

Talin2 has a lower affinity than Talin1 for both actin isoforms. Inclusion of the USH (++H) decreased the binding affinity for both cc- and b-actin \\\\(R\\\\) values for the Talin2 curve fits ranged from 0.999 to 0.934. (B) Hip1 F-actin cosedimentation assays.

[A] SDS-PAGE. a-Actin (20 mM) was mixed with ILWEQ module Talin1 (a-H) and an increasing concentration (0-10 mM) of the Talin1 USH. F-Actin cosedimentation was then carried out as for Figures 2 and 3. F-Actin was visualized with Coomassie Blue staining: the Talin1 USH was visualized by silver staining, while Talin1 (-H) was detected by immunoblotting. (B) Quantitative analysis. The parent bound, as a measure of the extent of cosedimentation of ILWEQ module Talin1 in the presence of increasing amounts of Talin1 USH in trans (-H, black bars), was determined densitometrically using the data shown in panel A. Increasing the amount of the USH decreased the actin binding level of [J/LWEQ module Talin1. The Talin1 (+H) value (striped bar) is taken from Figure 2B to show that the trans I/LWEQ module-USH interaction mimics the cis interaction. Values are averages of two separate experiments.\\n\\n'", "CAPTION FIG5.png": "'Figure 5: Model of interservice inhibition for ILWEQ module proteins. ILWEQ module Talin1 (+H) was used as a query sequence against the 3D-PSSM web server, version 2.6.0 (65). The ILWEQ module Talin1 sequence profile and secondary structure prediction were then scanned against the 3D-PSSM fold library to identify structural matches. The coordinates of the top 3D-PSSM match, apolipoprotein iii (E = 0.523), served as a template for the Talin1 ILWEQ module sequence to be aligned. Although the E value for this prediction is high, our data support a model in which the USH, by being in close apposition to Block 4 (red), may interfere with the intersection of the ILWEQ module with F-actin. This model was analyzed using RasMac.\\n\\n'", "CAPTION FIG6.png": "'Figure 6: [LWEQ module protein dimerization (A) Gd filtration.
