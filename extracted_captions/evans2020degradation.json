(**A**) Upon mitophagy induction, Parkin translocates to spherical mitochondria and increases the abundance of ubiquitin chains. OPTN and its kinase TBK1 are recruited followed by sequestration and elimination via autophasosome engulfment and lysosomal fusion, as monitored by LC3 and LAMP1/LysoT, respectively. This quality control mechanism is compartmentsally restricted to the soma and rarely occurs in the axon. As a result, other quality control pathways may regulate axonal mitochondria. (**B**) Parkin, Ub, TBK1 and OPTN localize with damaged organelles within an hour of inducing mitophagy. LC3 translocation occurs after OPTN and \\\\(\\\\sim\\\\)75% of OPTN-positive mitochondria are LC3-positive, forming mitophasosomes an hour after initial damage. Under basal conditions, 'late' mitophasosomes (OPTN-LAMP-positive mitochondria) routinely form within an hour. However, mitophagy induction perturbs this pathway, increasing the number of LAMP1-negative OPTN-positive mitochondria. Interestingly, only a small fraction of OPTN-positive mitochondria are acidified in either basal or induced conditions, suggesting lysosomal acidification to eliminate damaged organelles is rate-limiting.\\n\\n\""}
