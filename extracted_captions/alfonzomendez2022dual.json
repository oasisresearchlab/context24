This in parallel allows the biding of the downstream scaffold Grb2 and locally activates Src, which in turn phosphorylates BS-integrin cytoplasmic domain. The maintenance of the EGFR/Src/BS-integrin axis promotes flat clathrin lattice growth. A key implication of this model is that two different receptor systems are spatially organized at the nanoscale within flat clathrin lattices.
