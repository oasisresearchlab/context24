The fitted normal distributions of pentagons [red line in (AI), hexagons [green line in (BII)], and heptagons [blue line in (CII) peak at mean values approximately equal to the internal angles of the corresponding regular polygons. Fitting statistics are shown in the graphs. (D) Distribution of the sum of the three inter-arm angles in triskileia (\\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) + \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\)). Clathrin triskila conformations were mainly convex (\\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) + \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) + \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\) \\\\(\\\\times\\\\) 360\\\\({}^{\\\\circ}\\\\), red trace) or flat (\\\\(\\\\omega\\\\) + \\\\(\\\\beta\\\\) + \\\\(\\\\gamma\\\\) \\\\(\\\\times\\\\) 360\\\\({}^{\\\\circ}\\\\), blue trace) conformations. The observed convex triskileia do not display the inter-arm angle sums associated with assemblies of regular polygons [insets: (9II). **(E)** Correlation of CCP radius of curvature and inter-arm angle sum in triskela.

The lattice is initially rather flat along line 1. Following the first and second nanodisctions, the section analyses show the lattice separating into two separate CEPs with increased curvature (top profiles 1). In contrast, the nanodissected region is pulled down and flattened (bottom profiles 2). **(C)** Clathrin nanodissections lead to release of clathrin lattice constraints, allowing low-curvature CEPs to converge to energetically more favorable high-curvature CCP states (CCP energy landscape reproduced from Fig. 3E).
