Subscriptions describes the gap explained by participants' tendency to subscribe to more offered outlets in the pro-atitudinal treatment. Usage describes the gap explained by participants' tendency to view fewer posts on Facebook (use Facebook less often) in the counter-atitudinal treatment. Combinations describe interactions between these expressions. Data are based on 1,059 participants in the pro- and counter-atitudinal treatments for which posts in the Facebook feed could be observed in the two weeks following the intervention and at least one post is observed.
