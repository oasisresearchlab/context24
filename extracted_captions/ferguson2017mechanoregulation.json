Different growth phases (ff, fast formation; sf, slow formation; p, plateau; sd, slow dissolution; fd, fast dissolution) were determined by quantifying the change in the clathrin coat signal over 25-s long time windows (Ferguson et al., 2016). Bottom, for the same cells, bar plots show the mean-s.e.m. of the z. velocities of the trace fragments (12 s long) that are used to generate the growth rate distributions above.
