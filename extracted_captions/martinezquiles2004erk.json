(Right) Coomassie blue staining of the GST fusion proteins used in the pulldown assay. W.B., Western blot. (C) Cortactin binds directly to N-WASP. Recombinant baculovirus-expressed N-WASP protein was pulled down by GST-contactin fusion proteins coupled to GSH-beads. (D) Mapping of the N-WASP site for SH3-cort. Myctagged N-WASP fragments (N-WASP WG [EVH1 plus the GBD], WGP [EVH1 plus the GBD plus the proline-rich region], and VCA domains) were in vitro transcribed, translated, and used in a pulldown assay with GST-SH3-cort. Input (left) and bound (right top) proteins were Western blotted with an anti-Myc MAb (Santa Cruz). The membrane was reblotted with an anti-GST MAb (Santa Cruz) as a loading control (Ctrl.)

A GST fusion protein containing the proline-rich region of N-WASP (right) was able to pull down cortactin, which was detected by MAb 4F11 (Upstate) (65), from 3T3 fibroblast lysates (Lys.) (left).

Cortactin immunoprecipitates (I.P.) obtained with MAb 4F11 (5 mg) were blotted with anti-WASP MAb B9 and reprorbed with anti-cortactin MAb 4F11 (both MAbs were used at 1 mg/ml). WASP immunoprecipitates obtained with MAb B9 (5 mg, Santa Cruz) were Western blotted with anti-cortactin MAb 4F11 and reprobed with anti-WASP MAb B9.

Unstimulated (Unstim.) and bradykinin-stimulated cells were fixed, permeabilized, and then stained for F-actin with phalloidin-coumarin. Cortactin was detected with MAb 4F11, followed by goat anti-mouse-TRTTC, and N-WASP was detected with rabbit anti-N-WASP antibody, followed by goat anti-rabbit antibody Alexa 488.

Actin (1 mM actin, actin, pyrene-actin ratio of 9:1) and the Arp 2/3 complex (33 nM) were kept constant. N-WASP at 50 nM and VCA at 100 nM were used throughout all of the experiments. All reactions were initiated by the addition of actin. (A) Plots of fluorescence intensity against time since initiation of the polymerization reaction. Consistent with previous observations (48), addition of Cdc42-GTP\\\\(\\\\times\\\\)(400 nM) resulted in partial activation of N-WASP (trace 3).
