After initiation of the endocytic site, cargo is recruited to this site and the membrane is sculpted into an invagination, which is finally cut to generate an endosome. Clathrin is uncoated releasing the proteins of the endocytic machinery back to the cytosolic pool. The vesicle can now participate in intracellular membrane trafficking events. (Second row) Membrane shape changes during endocytosis are tightly coupled with the assembly of the endocytic protein machinery. The membrane shapes and the dynamics of membrane shaping differ between mammals and yeast. The key protein components of the endocytic machinery involved in membrane shaping are largely conserved between mammals and yeast.
