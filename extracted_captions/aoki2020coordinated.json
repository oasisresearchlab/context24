In freely moving calls, bleb cycle is regulated by the double-negative feedback loop between Rnd3-p190RhoGAP and RhoA-ROCK1 (left). Rnd3-p190RhoGAP helps bleb growth by suppressing RhoA activation and actin polymerization during the expansion phase. On the other hand, RhoA-ROCK1 promotes actin reassembly during the retraction phase and also removes Rnd3 from the plasma membrane by phosphorylating Rnd3. During apoptosis, bleb cycle is also regulated this double-negative feedback loop between Rnd3-p190 RhoGAP and RhoA-ROCK1, but in the early stage of apoptosis, ROCK1 is activated by caspase-3 in a RhoA independent manner. Therefore, ROCK1 excludes Rnd3 from the plasma membrane and RhoA is more likely to be activated in the early stage of apoptosis, resulting in the acceleration of retraction of bleb and the reduction in the size of blebs. Caspase 3 also cleaves the C-terminal region of Xkr8, leading to constitutive activation of Qkr8. Owing to the phospholipid scrambling activity of Xkr8, PtdIns(4,5)P2 together with PS in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane translocates to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. At the late stage of apoptosis, due to the phospholipid scrambling by Xkr8, the amount of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in the inner leaflet decreases. Reduction of the amount of PtdIns(4,5)P2 prevents the formation of the actin cortex and inhibits cross-linking activity of Ezrin, leading to the formation of larger bleb. Fragmented cellular components and substances such as DAMPs now can translocate to the bleb to form a functional apoptotic body.\\n\\n'"}
