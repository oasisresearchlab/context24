This schematic describes three scenarios in which membrane tension is low, intermediate or high, and how CME is accomplished efficiently by adaptive actin network organization. Under low tension (bottom), the clathrin coat provides sufficient force to advance CME. At intermediate tension (middle), actin polymerization is required for the transition from U to omega shape. At high tension (top), endocytic progression slows. More pits stall at the shallow conformation. In response to increased resistance, the actin network grows to envelop the coat and provide additional force against high membrane tension.\\n\\n'", "CAPTION FIG4.png": "'Figure 2: The scale impact of CSHs that increases the risk to increase in the demand imbalance reduction in the first, propensity reform for \\\\(\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\) reform models.
