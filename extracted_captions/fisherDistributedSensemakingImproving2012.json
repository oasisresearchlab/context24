The first user found some relevant resources and made an attempt to start organizing them into groups, but the second user was able to greatly improve on the organization. The third user expanded on the organizational groupings, adding a numbered step-by-step process for how to sort through the resources. The final user changed little of the organizational structure, and tried to synthesize it. The fourth person also started building an arrangement of rows and columns based on labels from the third user in order to provide a resource for many different combinations of options reflecting different needs (e.g., \u201ccost effective,\u201d \u201cindustrial\u201d).
