(a) The diagram depicts different domains of the cortactin protein including the F-actin-binding sites, C-terminal tyrosines that are phosphorylated by Src kinases, and the SH3 domain that binds Dyn2. Areas that peptide antibodies were directed against are indicated (asterisks). To test the specificity of the antibodies, peptide affinity-purified serum was used for immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. (b) An equal mass of total lysate from rat liver homogenate, cultured hepatocyte (clone 9 [C9]) lysate, or purified His,-cortactin (Cot) were immunoblotted with either the AB3, C-Tyr (C-Y), or a commercially available cotatcin monoclonal antibody (4F11 [F11]. Upstate Biotechnology). The polyclonal anti-cortactin antibodies and the 4F11 antibody specifically detected cortactin in all conditions. (c) Cortactin was immunoprecipitated (IP) from clone 9 lysates with each antibody, and the precipitated protein was immunoblotted with the 4F11 antibody. All cortactin antibodies tested precipitated cortactin that was easily detected by immunoblotting. (d) Coomassie staining of the immunoprecipitation reactions demonstrated that a substantial amount of cortactin was obtained and that it was the major protein species present (compare the bands from the immunoprecipitation against 0.2 mg of purified His,-cortactin [Cot]).

Flat or curved clathrin lattices as well as actin filaments can be seen associated with the plasma membrane. Numerous immuno-gold particles (yellow) can be seen, specifically labeling the clathrin cage and appear to cluster in a concentric ring along the pit base, as opposed to the bulb, as the membrane-invasinates (g).
