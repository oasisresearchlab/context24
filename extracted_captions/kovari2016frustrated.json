Cells were fixed at different times and labeled with pkalloidin-488 (_green_) and DAPI (_blue_). Each image is a different cell. At 5 min (the spreading phase), F-actin forms a dense band near the edge. This is consistent with the F-actin band seen during lamellipsoidal extension in migrating cells. At 10 min (the spreading-contraction transition), banding near the edge begins to fade and actin bundles begin to form throughout the cell body. Areas that are beginning to contract show retraction-teether formation. (a-c) At 15 min (the contraction phase), F-actin forms bundles that surround the perimeter of the cell. As shown in insets (b) and (c), these bundled fibers are often strongest near edges that are retracting, as indicated by retraction tethers.

Isolated spreading froes eventually pull the cell into two separate lobes connected by a thin tether. The protrusion velocity of each lobe gradually decreases from 0.06 mm/s to 0.02 mm/s as the cell is pulled apart.

During the spreading phase, a dense ARP2/3 branched actin network drives spreading via the actin-treadmill mechanism. As the cell\u2019s membrane reservoir is depleted, tension rises. Two general schemes might explain the onset of contraction. Membrane tension sensors may signal actin remodelers to stop actin polymerization. Alternatively, tension may stall outward protrusion mechanically. With protrusion stopped, myosin working from the cell interior toward the edge would cause actin filaments to bundle into contractile fibers. With the filaments bundled, myosin motors would exert tension along the perimeter bundles, causing the cell to contract. To see this figure in color, go online.\\n\\n'"}
