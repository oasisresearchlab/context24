B. Sreptolyan O (SLO)-penetration assay performed 1 h p. Panel 1 shows the no-SLO control, where there is no staining for GM-130, labeling absence of antibody penetration. Panels 2-5 show equivalent staining for GM130 (green), indicating that the transfection did not affect pore formation by SLO. **C.** SLO assay pretreated in cells transfected prior to viral infection with empty vector (EV), dynamic 2 overexpression centerset (OEPNRH2), scRNA, or siRNA (elDMM2). In SLO treated groups ( + SLO), viruses in endosomes appear red, while virions in cytosol appear yellow.
