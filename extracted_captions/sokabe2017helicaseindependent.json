(4) An mRNA can be re-reuted from the cellular pool to the 43S PK in a preaccommodated or accommodated state. The preaccommodated state involves the 43S PK in a closed latch and decoding site conformation, enabling eIF3] to bind in a high-affinity binding state. In the presence of eIF4F-ATP and the TC, the mRNA is accommodated into the 40S subburst decoding site to form the scanning competent 48S complex. In this state, the latch and decoding site of the 40S subunit adopt the open state, which exhibits a low-elf3] affinity binding state. In the presence of mRNA secondary structures, the accommodation step requires the generation of single-stranded mRNA through the ATP hydrolysis-dependent helicase activity of eIF4A. (8) In the ATP-bound state, eIF4A adopts a high-RNA affinity closed conformation, and, directly or indirectly, promotes the open conformation of the 40S subunit that allows scanning along the 5' UTR. In the ADP-bound state, eIF4A adopts a low-RNA affinity open conformation. In this state, the 40S subunit adopts a closed conformation that is likely to be less conductive to scanning. Multiple cycles of ATP hydrolysis by eIF4A during scanning might lead to rewards of opposing opening and closing conformations of eIF4A and the 40S subunit.\\n\\n\""}
