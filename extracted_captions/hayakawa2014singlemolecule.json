Image \\\\(\\\\epsilon\\\\) was generated by subtracting image a from image b. c and d show the intensity profile of the fluorescence spots in a and b, respectively. a shows the intensity profile of the subtracted image b-a. These profiles are fitted by Gaussian distributions. The position of the UAF-cofilin molecule is shown by the red arrow, and the additionally board UAF-cofilin is shown by the blue arrow. (B) An example of increases in a fluorescence intensity corresponding to initial and additional cofilin binding (a, red dotted line) and additional cofilin bindings (b, blue dotted line) (data in A and B are from different samples). The data acquisition area was a 600-ram-diameter circle. (C) Distribution of the distance between the intensity centroid of initial and additional cofilin bindings.
