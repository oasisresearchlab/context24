The image is a calculated average of six individual hexagons that were surrounded by hexagons. C) The scan across the hexagon (dark gray line in B) shows that the center of the hexagonal edges are located about 11 nm above the surface. The scan through neighboring vertices (light gray line in B) show that the vertices stand 12 nm above the surface. However, the connecting edges are not level but pass through a minimum of 11 nm half-way between the vertices. This clearly shows that clathrin triselike in planar lattices are puckered. D) Height of clathrin lattices when subjected to different forces, in the presence and absence of light chains. The vertical elasticity of the clathrin lattice is dependent on clathrin light chains, suggesting that light chains are important for both, the conformational stability of the clathrin triskelion and that of the lattice.
