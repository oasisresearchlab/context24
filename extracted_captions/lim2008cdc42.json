Only full-length IRSp53 generates filopodia with uniform actin and with similar characteristics (length, width, and lifetime) to filopodia generated by Cdc42 and N-WASP. The use of GFP-actin and time-lapse microscopy is essential to determine whether bona fide filopodia are being induced. (d, step I: Cdc42-GTP recruits IRSp53 to the plasma membrane. We have shown previously that a mutant IRSp53 that is unable to bind Cdc42 fails to localize with actin and does not generate filopodia (11). Disanza et al. (36) have shown biochemically that Cdc42 can recruit IRSp53 to the plasma membrane. Step 2: IRSp53 normally exists in a closed conformation where the SH3 domain is masked. Krugmann et al. (12) have shown that _C_-terminal of IRSp53 binds N-terminal. IRSp53 needs to adopt an open conformation, but the mechanism for this is unclear. One possibility is that N-WASP could promote an open IRSp53 conformation. Further work is necessary to address this issue. Step 3 recruitment by the IRSp53 SH3 domain of N-WASP, Mena and Eps8 allows coupling of I-BAR mediated membrane protrusion with actin dynamics and subsequent generation of filopodia formation.\\n\\n'", "CAPTION FIG2.png": "'FIGURE 2. **Mass spectrometry analysis of brain proteins binding to the IRSp53 SH3 domain affinity column.** Brain lysates were incubated with IRSp53-S43-GST bait proteins on glutathione-Sepharose beads, run on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining.
