{"CAPTION FIG1.png": "'Figure 1. Voyager 2\\'s Interface. The top panel (A) provides bookmark gallery and undo commands. The data panel (B) contains the dataset name, data fields (C), and wildcard fields (D). Wildcard fields let users create multiple views in parallel by serving as \"variables\" over an enumerated set of fields. Categorical, temporal, and quantitative field wildcards are provided by default, though users can manually author cartoon videos containing desired fields (E). The encoding panel (F) contains shelves for mapping fields to visual channels via drag-and-drop, and a control for selecting mark type. A _wildcard shelf_ (G) lets users add fields without selecting a specific channel, allowing the system to suggest appropriate encodings. The _filter_ panel (H) shows dynamic query controls for filtering. The primary focus view (I) displays the currently specified chart. _Related views_ (J) show recommended plots relevant to the focus view. Related summaries (K) suggest aggregate plots to summarize the data. _Field suggestions_ (L) show the results of encoding one additional field within the focus view.\\n\\n'", "CAPTION FIG10.png": "'Figure 10.
