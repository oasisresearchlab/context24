Proteins with both actin- and membrane-binding abilities (e.g., Hip1R) can anchor actin filaments to the membrane, converting pushing force into pulling and squeezing forces based on their spatial localization. In addition to the distribution of anchoring points, actin network morphology and polymerization force direction are defined by a second geometrical constraint, the position of actin assembly factors. Note that the precise localization of assembly factors and actin-membrane linkers is not clear for most of the displayed processes.\\n\\n'"}
