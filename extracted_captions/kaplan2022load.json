(G) Cartoon depicting an adaptive actin force-generating mechanism that counteracts elevated membrane tension to ensure robust CME progression. This schematic describes three scenarios in which membrane tension is low, intermediate, or high and how CME is accomplished efficiently by adaptive actin network organization. Under low tension (bottom), the clathrin coat provides sufficient force to advance CME. At intermediate tension (middle), actin polymerization is required for the transition from U to \\\\(\\\\Omega\\\\) shape. At high tension (top), endocytic progression slows. More pits stall at the shallow conformation. In response to increased resistance, the actin network grows to envelop the coat and provide additional force against high membrane tension.\\n\\n'"}
