U2O-AP2-GFP-ITGRS-mScarlett cells silenced for Talini shRNA or control shRNA were blotted for Talini and GAPDH. The position of molecular weight markers (in kDa) are shown on the left. **(C)** U2O-AP2-GFP-ITGRS-mScarlett cells silenced for Talini and GAPDH. The position of molecular weight markers (in kDa) are shown on the left. **(C)** U2O-AP2-GFP-ITGRS-mScarlett cells silenced for Talini and GAPDH.

This method generates binary masks for each channel. The paraffin channel is then subtracted from the integrin channel and results in a mask containing only the RAs. RA coverage is calculated by dividing the area covered by RAs in pixels (integrated density/25S) by the area covered by the cell (or cells) in an image.\\n\\n'"}
