Two peptides (peptides 1 and 2) obtained from the prominent 160-kDa band (arrow) were subjected to amino acid sequencing. In peptide 1, 8 of 10 amino acids agreed with amino acids 231 to 239 of CD13, and in peptide 2, all 42 amino acids agreed with amino acids 924 to 935 of CD13. (B) Fractions obtained by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation of the total cell lysate treated with Triton X-100 were subjected to immuno-blotting for CD13, TIfR, caveolin-1, and \\\\(\\\\alpha\\\\)-tubulin.

After fixation, the cells were labeled with an anti-caveolin-1 antibody. Labeling for caveolin-1 was seen as patches in all samples (b, e, h, and k). Labeling for CD13 was observed evenly on the cell surface without warming (a); after 10 min of incubation at 37\u00b0C, most of the labeling showed a linear alignment (d); after 30 min at 37\u00b0C, CD13 showed clustering, and colocalization with caveolin-1 became apparent (g to i; arrows); and after 60 min at 37\u00b0C, CD13 and caveolin-1 were colocalized extensively (j to l; arrows). The cells were treated with the anti-TFR antibody and the secondary antibody in the same manner as that described above.

At 0 h, most viruses bound to the flat portion of the plasma membrane (a and b).
