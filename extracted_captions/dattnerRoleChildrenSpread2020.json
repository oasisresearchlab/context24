Each row represents the timeline of an individual in the household. The age group of each member is given in parenthesis (precise ages are not supplied, due to privacy concerns). In these examples, Household 5 includes 8 individuals and Household 142 includes 5 individuals. Red circles denote positive PCR tests while green circles denote negative PCR tests. Red squares denote days of reported symptoms onset. The period between the two vertical lines denote the observed time-period used in the model fitting, which was set, for each household, according to the rules described in Section 2.2 of the Supplementary Material. Individuals whose label is colored in red are the suspected index cases, as determined by the criteria given in Section 2.3 of the Supplementary Material. In Household 5, there are three suspected index cases (p6-p8), whereas in Household 142 only one (p5). Members of Household 142 were also tested using serology and the results are shown using the asterisks - red for a positive result and green for a negative. As can be seen, member p5 of Household 142 was found positive both by PCR and serology, while member p2 was found positive using serology but not using PCR. The rest of the household members were found to be negative using both PCR and serology. The Supplementary Material contains similar timelines for all households in this study (excluding households with more than 10 individuals, which were removed for privacy considerations).\\n\\n'", "CAPTION FIG3.png": "'Figure 3: The number of new daily confirmed COVID-19 cases per 10,000 people in all of Israel and in the city of Bnei-Brak.
