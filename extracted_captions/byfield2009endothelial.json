A vacuum is applied; aspirating a portion of the cell (arrow) into the pipette bore (B, C). The aspirated length is monitored as a function of time revealing that bovine aortic endothelial cells cultured on stiff substrates are more difficult to deform relative to those cultured on compliant gels (D).\\n\\n'", "CAPTION FIG2.png": "'\\n\\n**Fig. 2.**\\n\\nIncreasing collagen concentration increases gel stiffness.

Cells within compliant gels (A) exhibit less intense actin staining and less prominent stress fibers as compared to cells within stiff gels (B). These differences in actin are preserved after the cells are isolated from compliant (C) or stiff (D) gels and plated on glass slides. Quantitative images analysis (E) confirm the qualitative observation. (F) The average actin fluorescence for cells is isolated from stiff and compliant gels decreases as a function of time since plating of cells onto glass slides.\\n\\n'", "CAPTION FIG4.png": "'\\n\\n**Fig. 4.**\\n\\nMicropipette aspiration data for endothelial cells isolated from relatively compliant (open symbols and bars) and relatively stiff (filled symbols and bars) gels.
