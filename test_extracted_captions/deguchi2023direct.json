(A) Kiresin walls on microtubules in a hard-over-hard manner. The apparent step size is 8 nm when the label is attached to the C-terminal tail domain and 16 nm when it is attached to the N-terminal motor domain. (B) 20 MIFLUX tracking of a single molecule. A draw beam probes seven positions around a fluorophore to determine its location with nanometer precision. The scan pattern is iteratively centered on the fluorophore during tracking. (C) Micro-PMNT approach to track, kinesin in fixed cells. Cells are first permeabilized to extract cell contents and then gently feed to pressure microtubules. Purified fluorescently labeled kinesin (DmKHC (0-42L))-SNAP-tag-to-offel are added and tracked as they mask toward the plus ends of the microtubules (move S1). Parts (D) to (M) show MNFLUX motor-PMNT in fixed cells. (**D**) Confocal images of a neuron and overlaid kinesin trajectories in four neurites. Most of the neurites show kinesin trajectories in both directions, i.e., toward (magenta) and away (cyan) from the soma, as expected for dendrites.
