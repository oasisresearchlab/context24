Proposed steps in model: (1) V-1 globally inhibits Capping Protein (CP) in the cytoplasm, (2) membrane-associated CARMIL [at the protruding cell edge] catalyzes dissociation of V-1 from CP, (3) the resulting CARMIL-CP complex is partially active, binding weakly to free barbed ends to provide capping function, (4) an unknown factor or mechanism promotes dissociation of CARMIL from CP, allowing V-1 to rebind CP and complete the cycle. (**D** Our revised working model for the CP regulatory cycle. We propose that V-1 functions to maintain a cytosolic reservoir of inactive CP, from which Twinfilin and CARMIL activate CP, generating two distinct forms of active CP in cells: Twinfilin-CP complexes and CARMIL-CP complexes. Twinfilin-CP complexes are fully active and support stable capping of barbed ends. In contrast, CARMIL-CP complexes have ~100 fold reduced affinity for barbed ends, and may therefore more transiently cap barbed ends, permitting restricted network growth at the cell membrane where CARMIL localizes. CARMIL and Twinfilin directly compete with each other for binding CP (shown in close up of Transition state), which may result in the displacement of CP from Twinfilin. This would disease Twinfilin at the barbed end to catalyze depolymerization, or alternatively return filaments back to the original state of assembly.\\n\\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/elte.41313013\\n\\nThe following figure supplement is available for figure 7:\\n\\nFigure 1: Structural model for a ternary complex formed by Twinfilin, Capping Protein and the barbed end of an actin filament.
