{"CAPTION FIG6.png": "'Figure 5: Proposed mechanism of N-WASP activation by _Nck_. In the auto-inhibited _contamination_, the N-WASP C helix binds intramolecularly to the GBD. _Nck_ binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors _can_ the membrane and activates N-WASP by competitively displacing the C helix from the GBD with its inter-SH3AB linker. The released VCA segment is available to activate the Arp2/3 complex. Polyvalent interactions between the SH3 domains of _Nck_ and the proline-rich region (PFR) of N-WASP can lead to higher-order olig-camar formation, increasing the local density of activated N-WASP molecules.\\n\\n'", "CAPTION FIG5.png": "'\\n\\n## References\\n\\nFig. 5: NMR analysis reveals direct binding of the Ndix inter-SH3 linker and the N-WASP GBD.
