{"CAPTION FIG2.png": "'Figure 2: Effects of mechanical force and nucleotide bound to Arp2/3 complex on the time course of dissociation of actin filament branches. Arp2/3 complex branches were assembled in the flow chamber before applying flow as described in Materials and Methods. In \\\\(A\\\\) and \\\\(C\\\\), the force on each observed branch was calculated from its length and the flow rate, and then binned at the indicated average forces values (see Materials and Methods). (_A_) The effect of force on the time course of dissociation of actin filament branches formed by ATP-actin monomers and ATP-Arp2/3 complex and aged for 30 min, when most branches had ADP bound to Arp2/3 complex. The fraction of branches remaining is plotted. Smooth curves are the best fits of single exponentials to the data. Each trace includes at least 14 branches. (_B_) Dependence of the time course of dissociation of branches formed with ATP-actin monomers and ATP-Arp2/3 complex with different aging times (2.5, 4, 12, and 30 min) and the presence of BaFe. For all time courses, 500 mL min-1 of buffer flow was applied to the branches for discharging, producing a force of ~1 pN for a branch of 1.5 mm. The force on each branch was not calculated for the data shown. Smooth curves are the best global fits of double exponentials to the data for aging branches and yielded two shared rate constants for detachability: slow \\\\(k_{SF}\\\\) = 0.32 (\\\\(\\\\pm\\\\)0.005) min\u20131 and fast \\\\(k_{SF}\\\\) = 6.67 (\\\\(\\\\pm\\\\)0.44) min\u20131. Smooth curves are the best single exponential fits to the data for branches aged for 4 and 30 min with BaFe, with lifetimes of 13.9 (\\\\(\\\\pm\\\\)0.2) min\u20131 for the sample aged for ~4 min and 14.8 (\\\\(\\\\pm\\\\)0.09) min\u20131 for the sample aged for 30 min. Fig. 40 presents the fractional amplitudes obtained from the double exponential fits. (_C_) The effect of force on the time course of the dissociation of actin filament branches formed by ATP-actin monomers and ATP-Arp2/3 complex and aged for ~4 min using the same data collection and analysis methods as in \\\\(A\\\\). The smooth curves are best fits of the data to single (_F_ < 0.5 pN) or double (_F_ > 0.6 pN) exponentials. The fractional amplitudes of the slow phase in the time courses that follow the double exponentials are 0.71 +- 0.05 (_F_ = 0.98 pN), 0.39 +- 0.06 (_F_ = 1.25 pN), 0.81 +- 0.05 (_F_ = 1.60 pN), 0.38 +- 0.02 (_F_ = 1.93 pN), and 0.17 +- 0.02 (_F_ = 2.86 pN).

Each trace includes at least 13 branches. The smooth curves are single exponential fits to the time course. Branches dissociate slowly under 0.2 pN of force, so the dehydration time course cannot be reliably fitted to obtain the branch lifetime.
