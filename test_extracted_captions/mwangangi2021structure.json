CP consists of two subunits, a-subunit (CPa) and b-subunit (CPb). Twinfilin comprises two ABC + domains (D1 and D2), a linker between D1 and D2 that includes a helix (residues 151 to 165), and a C-terminal tail (Taaf; residues 316 to 342, the last eight amino acids are disordered). Actin subunit 1 is bound to twinfilin D1, and subunit 2 to twinfilin D2. The twinfilin secondary structure elements are colored differentially, helices in red, strands in cyan, and loops and extended regions in orange, with the Taaf in lime green. (**B**) Front view (same as in (**D1**), in which the actin subunits and twinfilin are represented as surfaces. Twinfilin is shown entirely in orange.

(**B**) Twufflin-sided uncapping is a result of twufflin ADF+ domains inducing G-actin-like conformations in the terminal two actin protomers, weakening actin-actin interactions in the filament, leading to the dissociation of the complex. (**C**) Twinflin-V-1-aided uncapping requires space for V-1 to reach its binding site on CP via a wobble state of the twufflin-bound complex. Once V-1 is bound, CP is unable to reassociate with actin. In vitro effects of twufflin alone on actin filaments and comparisons of uncapping models in the absence of twinflin are shown in fig. 59.\\n\\n'", "CAPTION FIG5.png": "'Figure 5: V-1 uncaps filament barbed ants in the presence of twinfilin. Pyrene-actin polymerization assay showing uncapping of F-actin seeds by V-1 in the presence of twinfilin. Unlabeled F-actin seeds (0.5 mM) were capped with 100 mM CP and subsequently polymerized in either 2 mM actin (10% pyrene)/28 mM grofilm (red) or 2 mM actin (10% pyrene)/28 mM grofilm supplemented with either 1 mM twinfilin (yellow), 5 mM V-1 [purple], or a mixture of 1 mM twinfilin and 5 mM V-1 (blue). As a control F-actin seeds were polymerized in the absence of CP (black). As shown in the profile, the presence of both twinfilin and V-1 induces accelerated polymerization of pre-capped F-actin seeds (blue) to almost the same level as the positive control (black). By contrast, twinfilin alone (yellow) induces very low level of polymerization, similar to CP alone (red), while V-1 alone (purple) only induces minimal polymerization.\\n\\n'", "CAPTION FIG3.png": "'\\nFig. 3: **Conformations of CP.** (**A**) Comparison of the twinfilin tail (yellow) binding site with CAMRIL (cyan) on CP.
