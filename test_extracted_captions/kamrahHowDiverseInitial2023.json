Each plot also has text indicating the net cumulative optimality gap (NCOG), a positive value corresponds to a better performance by high-diversity samples compared to the low-diversity samples. The plot shows that BO benefits from diversity in some cases but not others. There is no obvious trends in how the NCOG values change in the grid.

The optimal hyper-parameter for each of the 100 wildcat wells instances from each family is also plotted as horizontal lines\u2014in many but not all cases these overlap. Each cell in the plot also has the 95th percentile confidence bound on MAE for both diverse and non-diverse samples. The results show that MAE confidence bounds for non-diverse samples are smaller compared to diverse samples for all the families of wildcat wells function. Thus, indicating a presence of model building advantage for non-diverse initial samples.
