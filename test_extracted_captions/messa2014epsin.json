(**A**) Schematic representation of the role of apsin in the coupling of the endocytic clathrin coat to actin in cooperation with Hip1R (left). This coupling helps invaginate the pit. Only apsin localized at the equator of the bud is shown to emphasize its actin-related function in pit invagination, but apsin is not restricted to the equator. Higher magnification representation of the interactions of apsin (night): the N-terminal ENTH domain binds (1) the PI[4,5]P\\\\({}_{2}\\\\)-rich membrane bilayer of the plasma membrane (and partially penetrates it), [2] the ANTH domain of Hip1R, and (3) synaptobrevin2/NAMP2; its tail binds (1) ubiquitinated cargo proteins (via UIMs), (2) AP-2 and clathrin heavy chain (via DPF/DPW motifs and 'clathrin boxes', respectively), and (3) the EH domain region of Eps15 (via NPF motifs). Epsin's tail also binds F-actin and co-operates with the THATCH domain of Hip1R in the coupling of the actin cytoskeleton to the clathrin-coated pit. In both fields Hip1R is depicted as a monomer but functions as a dimer, or heterodimer with Hip1. (**B**) Schematic representation of the multiple functions of apsin in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Epsin participates in the early stages of the reaction as a coat nucleator, curvature inducer/sensor and also helps coupling bud formation to SNARE incorporation. As the coat matures, Lbequitinated cargo is recruited. Additionally, the link between apsin/Hip1R and actin is required for the deep invagination of the pit, and this is the process at which the action of apsin becomes essential. Subsequently, the force produced by actin and the bilayer destabilizing properties of apsin's ENTH domain may co-operate with dynamin in fission.\\n\\n**Figure 8.** The binding of the actin cytoskeleton to the actin cytoskeleton to the actin cytoskeleton to the actin cytoskeleton.
