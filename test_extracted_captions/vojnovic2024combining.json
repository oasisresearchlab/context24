{"CAPTION FIG1.png": "'Figure 1: Principle and performance of the SKV method. (_a_) Principle of SKV sample preparation, a correlative ECPAIM protocol for expanding yeast. Shown are cell wall (black), cell membrane (grey), inner and outer nuclear membrane (magenta), target protein (blue), FP marker (red) and the PAA gel mesh (orange). The acrylate group of the protein anchoring agent _ACV_ is highlighted in orange. (_b_) Fixian yeast cells expand approximately fivefold using the SKV protocol. (_d_) SKV provides a macroscale isotropic expansion as determined by two different samples, measuring (_i_) cytosol widths and (_ii_) nuclear diameter (_liu_132) of non-expanded and expanded cells imaged over a total of nine different experiments. The expansion factor was determined to be 4.9 [e.g. 0.2, s.d. 0.8) (cytosel width) and 4.9 [e.g. 0.2, s.d. 0.9] (nuclear diameter), respectively. Note that nuclear widths were estimated from diffraction limited epifluorescence data and cannot be compared directly to cytosolic widths derived from SLIM data. (_d_) Additionally, the isotropic microscale expansion of the SKV protocol was probed investigating cell borders. Here, cells expanded with the SKV protocol show no mfos2 localizations being pulled outside of the cell area and hence an isotropic expansion on the microscale. (_e_) SKV retains 46% (s.e. 3.1%, s.d. 21.8%) of FP signal retention, whereas the original protein retained 22% (s.e. 2.0%, s.d. 12.4%).\\n\\n'", "CAPTION FIG3.png": "'Figure 3: Examples of 5kY microscopy 5kY imaging of high (\\\\(a\\\\)\u2013\\\\(c\\\\)) and low (\\\\(d\\\\)\u2013\\\\(f\\\\)) abundant proteins in fission yeast.
