{"SUPP CAPTION FIGS1.png": "\"\\n\\n**Supplemental Figure 1. (Related to Figure 1) This figure shows a series of control experiments that characterize the properties of the tubular invaginations generated in response to ATP depletion. It also documents the efficacy of the ATP depletion treatment.**\\n\\n**(A)** Alexa488-STxB and Alexa488-CTxB accumulate in tubular invaginations in ATP depleted COS-7 cells. To facilitate STxB labeling, cells were transfected with Gb3 synthase. **(B, C)** As reported previously (78), fluorescent CTxB labels both plasma membrane invaginations (arrowheads) and plasma membrane protrusions (arrows) in ATP depleted cells. B and C are single frames from a confocal z-stack. Dashes mark the position of the xz-sections shown below. **(D)** Alexa488-STxB and Alexa555-CTxB colocalize in invaginations in ATP depleted COS-7 cells expressing Gb3 synthase. **(E)** Tubules prelabeled with Alexa555-CTxB filled at approximately the same rate as newly added Alexa488-CTxB accumulates at the plasma membrane, indicating that the tubules are open to the fluid phase in ATP depleted cells. Time stamps are in minutes:seconds. **(F-H)** ATP depletion inhibits uptake of dextran and internalization of transferrin (Tfn) (Mean +- SD, N = 325-417 cells). ***, p < 0.001, Student's t-test.
