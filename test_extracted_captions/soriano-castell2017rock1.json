An increase of PI(4,5)P\\\\({}_{2}\\\\) in PM ordered domains could induce the recruitment of several PI(4,5) P\\\\({}_{2}\\\\)-binding proteins to generate an incipient membrane deformation (1). When Rac1 activity is low (2), the invagination can be elongated by dyneins toward the center of the cell along microtubules. PI(4,5)P\\\\({}_{2}\\\\) accumulation, as well as the high degree of membrane curvature, could lead to the recruitment of dynamin or BAR-domain proteins, which in turn, could propagate and stabilize the tubule. By contrast, when Rac1 activity is high, tubulation process could be inhibited by either PLC activation (reducing PIP\\\\({}_{1}\\\\) levels) or cytoskeleton regulation (inducing cortical actomyosin at the PM) (3). Rac1 appears to stimulate cortactin PM translocation and ROCK1 activity, thereby triggering cortical actin polymerization and association with myosin (i.e., actomyosin). The resulting over-activation of local actomyosin networks could potentially impede tubulation in one of two ways: (i) by forming a local barrier to increasing PM tension or by causing a steric hindrance that impedes the recruitment of tubulating proteins (4); or (ii) by generating mechanical forces needed to pinch off membrane invaginations more efficiently (5).\\n\\n'", "CAPTION FIG2.png": "'Figure 2: Increased levels of PI(4,5)P\\\\({}_{2}\\\\) induces membrane tubules at the PM.
