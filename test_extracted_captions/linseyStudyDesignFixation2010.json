We show that the system is a (non-equilibrium) system, and that the system is a (non-equilibrium) system, and that the system is a (non-equilibrium) system, is a (non-equilibrium) system. We show that the system is a (non-equilibrium) system, and that the system is a (non-equilibrium) system, and that the system is a (non-equilibrium) system, is a (non-equilibrium) system. We show that the system is a (non-equilibrium) system, and that the system is a (non-equilibrium) system, and that the system is a (non-equilibrium) system, is a (non-equilibrium) system. We also show that the system is a (non-equilibrium) system, and that the system is a (non-equilibrium) system, is a (non-equilibrium) system, and that the system is a (non-equilibrium) system. We also show that the system is a (non-equilibrium) system, and that the system is a (non-equilibrium) system, is a (non-equilibrium) system, and that the system is a (non-equilibrium) system.
