CME lifetime is measured from the first frame of the AP2 signal to the presumed scission time (the peak of DNM2 signal). ARPC3 positive CME events have longer lifetimes. p-value from two-sided Welch\u2019s t-test: 2.1e-76. **b** Averaged intensity vs time plots of ARPC3 negative (top) and positive (bottom) CME sites in ADA cells.

ARPC3 positive CME sites move slower than ARPC3 negative ones. p-value from two-sided Kolmograv-Smirnov test: ARPC3 + before vs ARPC3- before: 1.27e-14, ARPC3 + after vs ARPC3- after: 5.18e-08. **d** Straightness-index of ARPC3 negative (blue) and positive (yellow) CME sites before (solid line) and after (dashed line) excision. The straightness-index is defined by the ratio between the sum of frame-to-frame distances to the end-to-end distance of a single event\u2019s trajectory, where a perfectly straight-lined trajectory would have an index of 1. ARPC3 positive CME sites move with a more straight trajectory. p-value from two-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov test: ARPC3 + before vs ARPC3- before: 1.07e-11, ARPC3 + after vs ARPC3- after: 2.06e-6. **a\u2013d** ARPC3 + \\\\(N\\\\)= 840, ARPC3 + \\\\(N\\\\)= 1,385. **a, c, d** Source data are provided in the Source Data file.\\n\\n'", "CAPTION FIG7.png": "'\\n\\n## References\\n\\nFig. 7: **An updated schematic model of actin-negative and actin-positive clathrin-coated pits in human cells.** Actin assembly is induced at stalled CME sites, where asymmetric forces pull, bend and possibly twist the plasma membrane against membrane tension to drive membrane invaginations and vesicle scission.\\n\\n'", "CAPTION FIG3.png": "'\\nFig. 3: **Airscan live-cell imaging reveals asymmetric actin organization at CME sites.****a** A representative single time frame image of an Airscan movie (Supplementary Movie 3) of DNM2-tagGP72 (red) and JFG35 ligand-conjugated ARPC3-HaloTag (cyan) on the ventral plasma membrane surface of ADAM cells.
